__label__logisticstracking or  tracking  device  that  its  bearing  for  any  given  iot  solution,  the  underlying  technologies  and  core  features  must  be  tailored  to  the  needs  and  constraints  of  the  specific  use  case.  although  aquatic  animal  tracking  has  its  own  unique  challenges,  so  too  does  every  iot  application.  here  are  some  of  the  ways  in  which  aquatic  animal  tracking  addresses  its  challenges:  to  overcome  the  challenge  of  communicating  in  water,  given  that  rf  signals  dont  propagate  well  through  water,  many  aquatic  animal  tracking  applications  make  use  of  acoustic  relays.  acoustic  tags  attached  to  the  animals  being  tracked  emit  acoustic  signals  typically  ultrasound  which
__label__logisticstracking travel  through  water  much  better  than  rf  signals.  these  signals  are  then  received  by  buoys,  which  can  then  use  satellite  communications  to  backhaul  the  data  to  where  its  needed.  this  approach  is  quite  similar  in  character  to  other  iot  applications.  many  iot  applications  use  one  kind  of  connectivity  for  the  edge  to  collect  data  from  edge  devices  and  then  use  either  a  hard  connection  or  a  different  kind  of  connectivity  to  backhaul  the  data.  for  example,  in  agricultural  settings,  sensors  may  use  a  private  lowpower  widearea  network  like  lora  to  send  data  to  a  ,  then  that  gateway  uses  satellite
__label__logisticstracking connectivity  to  communicate  data  from  all  those  sensors  to  the  cloud.  in  this  case,  the  connectivity  at  the  edge  is  ultrasound  rather  than  lora  and  uses  acoustic  relays  on  buoys  instead  of  lora  gateways.  the  acoustic  relays  can  also  be  used  as  a  positioning  system,  identifying  the  position  of  an  animal  in  a  defined  space  via  timedelayofsignalarrival  triangulation.  while  acoustic  relays  can  be  invaluable  in  certain  aquatic  animal  tracking  applications,  acoustic  signals  are  very  limited  in  range  compared  to  rf  signals.  this  means  that  many  buoys  would  need  to  be  deployed  to  cover  a  large  area,  which  can  be  expensive
__label__logisticstracking and  difficult  to  manage.  enter  mobile  transceivers:  an  impressive  underwater  technology  called  mobile  transceiver,  made  by  a  company  called  vemco.  it  can  be  carried  by  larger  animals,  say  seals,  and  basically,  that  seal  is  transmitting  its  whereabouts  as  it  moves  around  the  ocean,  but  any  tagged  fish  or  seal,  any  other  tagged  animal  it  encounters,  it  also  records  that,  said  iverson.  though  relatively  new,  this  technology  and  approach  could  enable  aquatic  animal  tracking  across  much  greater  geographies  by  leveraging  the  animals  themselves  as  mobile  tracking  platforms.  another  approach  to  overcome  the  challenges  posed  by  limited  rf  signal  propagation  and  constraints
__label__logisticstracking of  acoustic  relays,  is  the  use  of  popup  satellite  tags.  as  the  name  would  imply,  after  some  period  of  time  recording  sensor  data,  the  tag  detaches  itself  from  the  animal  and  floats  to  the  surface  where  it  uses  satellite  connectivity  to  uplink  the  data  stored  on  the  tag.  this  approach  can  be  used  in  conjunction  with  mobile  transceivers  to  collect  data  while  the  tagged  animal  moves  through  the  ocean,  then  to  get  that  data  back  to  relevant  parties  without  the  need  for  physical  retrieval  or  reliance  on  acoustic  receivers.  while  acoustic  relays  can  help  provide  location  data  over  time,  mobile
__label__logisticstracking transceivers  and  popup  satellite  tags  still  face  the  limitation  of  gps  only  being  available  at  the  surface.  one  way  to  overcome  this  challenge  is  to  use  lightbased  geolocation.  while  not  as  accurate  as  gps,  for  migration  patterns  or  general  movement  of  animals  across  broad  geographies,  this  can  still  be  enough.  by  using  sensors  on  tags  to  record  light  data  and  often  temperature  data  to  augment,  we  can  use  varying  light  levels  over  time  to  calculate  longitude  and  latitude  readings  for  the  animal.  however,  this  can  prove  difficult  for  animals  that  change  depths  and  requires  that  the  animals  are  in  the

__label__logisticstracking tracking  their  cattle  using  just  pen  and  paper,  according  to  brian  schupbach,  cofounder  and  cto  of  quantified  ag.  in  the  last  five  years,  the  cattle  industry  has  made  leaps  and  bounds  in  technology  advances,  schupbach  said.  but  five  years  ago,  there  was  really,  truly  nothing.  i  remember  getting  into  it  and  thinking,  this  is  the  industry  technology  forgot.  schupbach  is  trying  to  change  that  with  quantified  ag,  a  nebraskabased  livestock  data  analytics  company.  they  make  smart  ear  tags  for  cattle  which  schupbach  likens  to  fitbits  for  cows  as  well  as  a  web  and  mobilebased  software  platform  that  ranchers  can  use
__label__logisticstracking to  monitor  the  health  of  their  animals.  after  about  four  years  of  research  and  development,  quantified  ag  is  preparing  to  launch  its  first  commercial  product  later  this  year.  schupbach  spoke  to  zdnet  about  the  challenges  of  bringing  iot,  machine  learning  and  other  cuttingedge  technologies  to  a  traditional  industry.  he  was  joined  by  jeff  kim,  ceo  of  kmesh,  a  business  thats  helped  quantified  ag  with  data  orchestration.  here  are  the  highlights  of  that  conversation:  the  whole  goal  is  to  really  monitor  the  temperature  and  activity  patterns  of  these  animals,  and  at  the  end  of  the  day,  come  to  a  determination  if
__label__logisticstracking theyre  healthy  or  sick,  schupbach  said.  this  helps  cattle  operations  with  labor  and  costs  and  really  treating  animals  that  truly  need  to  be  treated,  rather  than  kind  of  a  guessandcheck  game,  which  is  what  theyre  currently  doing.  around  one  in  five  cattle  actually  end  up  getting  sick  when  theyre  at  a  ranch  or  feed  yard,  which  is  a  pretty  high  percentage.  humans  are  generally  not  very  good  at  finding  that...  even  the  best  veterinarians  are  just  about  60  percent  accurate,  and  thats  even  using  diagnostic  tools  like  thermometers  and  stethoscopes  and  things  like  that.  meanwhile,  schupbach  explained,  most  livestock  operations
__label__logisticstracking rely  on  pen  riders,  or  cowboys,  to  simply  get  on  a  horse  and  they  ride  around  all  day  long  to  visually  scan  for  sick  animals.  with  the  sometimes  large  amount  of  animals  that  could  be  in  a  cattle  operation,  they  have  just  about  four  seconds  per  animal  to  make  that  determination  if  theyre  sick  or  healthy...  theyre  using  the  same  method  of  identifying  sick  animals  as  they  did  100  years  ago.  once  a  cow  is  wearing  a  sensor,  some  pieces  of  data  are  recorded  on  a  microsecond  basis,  schupbach  explained,  such  as  their  activity.  temperature,  we  dont  need  that  type
__label__logisticstracking of  fidelity,  so  we  actually  get  that  once  per  hour,  he  continued.  at  the  end  of  every  hour,  a  data  summary  is  sent  to  a  central  base  station,  which  then  sends  the  information  to  the  cloud.  from  there,  its  combined  with  metadata  such  as  an  animals  weight,  breed  and  sex.  most  of  the  metadata  is  manually  entered  by  ranchers,  but  quantified  ags  platform  can  also  get  information  from  other  connected  devices,  such  as  the  .  the  system  also  considers  external  data,  such  as  weather  information.  we  feed  that  into  a  few  different  machine  learning  classifiers  and  also  some  regular  statistical
__label__logisticstracking models,  schupbach  said,  and  at  the  end  of  the  day,  we  come  out  with  a  list...  of  which  animal  is  sick.  from  the  beginning,  quantified  ags  platform  was  built  for  scalability  and  a  multicloud  approach,  schupbach  said.  these  iot  devices  have  limited  memory,  limited  processing  power,  so  its  really  not  feasible  to  run  a  lot  of  the  machine  learning  algorithms  that  we  use  to  generate  health  outcomes  from  data  centers,  he  said.  they  wanted  to  use  multiple  cloud  solutions  primarily  for  redundancy.  feedlot  operators  or  cattle  operations,  if  we  provide  a  product  to  them  that  monitors  the  health  of  their
__label__logisticstracking herd,  its  really  important  that  we  are  highly  available,  schupbach  said.  we  cant  miss  a  day  because  it  would  hurt  their  pocketbooks,  it  would  hurt  the  animals  health,  and  some  animals  could  even  die.  the  team  started  on  amazon  web  services,  he  said,  and  then  turned  to  microsoft  azure  after  evaluating  some  of  its  machine  learning  services.  we  thought  this  would  be  fairly  easy  to  implement,  schupbach  said  with  respect  to  multicloud  management,  but  as  we  got  into  it,  especially  being  able  to  do  it  at  scale,  was  going  to  be  just  an  enormous  project.  we  thought  we  might  even
__label__logisticstracking have  to  hire  a  fulltime  person  just  to  kind  of  manage  this  orchestration  of  data.  quantified  ag  turned  to  saas  vendor  for  multicloud  data  management,  with  the  initial  expectation  of  simply  running  applications  on  azure  and  keeping  data  on  aws  as  a  backup  solution.  now,  however,  the  company  is  starting  to  explore  the  true  potential  of  a  multicloud  strategy.  it  kind  of  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  use  some  of  our  favorite  tools  in  aws  and  also  explore  maybe  even  the  google  cloud  platform,  which  previously  we  kind  of  knew  it  was  there,  but  we  never  really  looked  at,  because
__label__logisticstracking we  didnt  want  to  migrate  everything  over  there,  schupbach  said.  azures  machine  learning,  i  think,  is  fantastic.  i  think  theyre  slightly  ahead  of  aws.  on  aws  we  really  enjoyed  redshift...  ive  never  used  it  before,  but  ive  always  wanted  to  try  google  bigquery  as  well.  kmesh  ceo  jeff  kim  stressed  that  data  management  becomes  more  critical  for  a  firm  like  quantified  ag  when  it  starts  doing  international  business.  quantified  ag  is  currently  finishing  up  its  testing  in  kansas  and  oklahoma,  but  it  also  has  a  presence  in  australia  already.  with  the  new  world  of  data  privacy  and  data  sovereignty...  a
__label__logisticstracking lot  of  this  iot  data  is  going  to  come  under  compliance,  he  noted.  as  the  livestock  industry  goes  global,  the  industry  will  have  to  comply  with  rules  at  local,  national  and  regional  levels.  while  there  will  certainly  be  challenges  ahead,  schupbach  said  that  consumer  preferences  and  economic  realities  are  driving  the  industry  to  embrace  the  kind  of  technology  quantified  ag  is  offering.  relying  on  cowboys  to  monitor  cattle  is  timeintensive,  he  said.  and  believe  it  or  not,  theres  not  a  lot  of  kids  growing  up  that  want  to  be  cowboys  anymore.  they  are  facing  an  extreme  labor  shortage,  so  a
__label__logisticstracking huge  component  to  this  tag  is  they  dont  have  to  stick  to  the  stable  label  or  be  shorthanded.  on  top  of  that,  schupbach  said,  theres  a  big  push  from  consumers  not  to  treat  animals  with  antibiotics  and  that  sort  of  thing.  large  corporations  like  are  demanding  that  cattle  producers  meet  certain  health  and  wellness  standards.  as  quantified  ag  readies  to  roll  out  commercially,  its  also  conducting  tests  within  the  live  cattle  shipping  market.  theyre  preparing  to  test  their  technology  on  a  shipment  going  from  australia  to  indonesia.  they  actually  take  live  cattle  and  put  them  on  boats  and  ship  them
__label__logisticstracking to  another  country,  schupbach  explained.  so  australia  is  pretty  big  into  this.  they  ship  anywhere  from  vietnam  to  indonesia,  and  even  the  united  states.  hawaii,  believe  it  or  not,  has  a  pretty  large  operation  that  ships  to  the  mainland.  so  its  a  real  big  problem  to  monitor  cattle  health  on  boats.  during  the  test,  quantified  ag  plans  to  use  a  satellite  internet  provider  to  send  data  back  to  the  cloud.  schupbach  said  hes  not  sure  how  it  will  go,  but  thats  why  were  doing  this  test.  from  there,  the  next  step  for  the  business  would  be  to  move  some  computing

__label__logisticstracking sensors  themselves  also  need  to  be  very  low  power  or  even  disposable  because  a  truck  roll  to  change  or  charge  batteries  invalidates  any  business  model  due  to  the  cost  sensitivities  in  some  applications.  lorawan  low  power  wide  area  networks  lpwan  are  being  used  in  several  continents  to  get  data  from  the  field  across  many  application  verticals  because  of  the  technologys  inherent  low  power  and  long  range  capabilities.  as  it  is  an  open  communications  standard  there  are  many  deployment  and  business  model  options  available  from  simple  farm  only  private  networks  to  agricultureasaservice  offerings.  historically  it  had  always  been  the  connected  fridge

__label__logisticstracking available  and  the  cows  cant  all  be  tagged  overnight.  the  point  is  that  to  make  iot  viable,  the  cost  per  cow  needs  to  be  significantly  less  than  the  loss  and  be  relevant  to  the  needs  of  the  application.  in  new  zealand  the  livestock  market  profit  per  animal  is  all  publically  available  per  farm  at  .  with  some  farms  only  making  us100us200  per  animal,  unless  there  is  a  high  risk  of  loss  or  theft,  a  high  cost  to  track  will  leave  poor  daisy  lost.  connected  cows  will  aid  farm  profits  there  are  many  other  ways  iot  can  significantly  help  with  livestock

__label__logisticstracking of  patients,  hospitals  are  under  constant  pressure  to  constantly  track  their  medical  supplies  and  equipment  and  ensure  that  they  are  properly  utilised.  improper  inventory  management  leads  to  ineffective  use  of  organisational  assets  leading  to  heavy  losses.  similarly,  usage  of  manual  systems  and  outdated  equipment  may  lead  to  operational  errors  which  are  detrimental  to  the  hospitals  efficiency  and  integrity.  this  is  why  hospitals  are  trying  to  harness  the  iot  in  asset  management  and  tracking  to  ensure  both  profitability  and  patient  satisfaction.  iot  can  be  effectively  utilised  for  asset  management  in  healthcare  in  the  following  ways.  iot  uses  the  technology  of  rfid
__label__logisticstracking tags  to  track  and  monitor  the  healthcare  assets  like  infusion  pumps,  blood  bags  and  medical  supplies.  these  radiofrequency  identificationrfid  tags  monitor  the  temperature,  humidity,  location  and  utilisation  of  these  resources.  this  helps  to  evaluate  the  shelf  life,  deterioration  time  and  expiry  date  of  supplies.  accurate  stocking,  preventive  maintenance  and  correct  demand  forecasting  of  these  supplies  lead  to  optimal  asset  management  thereby  reducing  costs  and  wastage.  shortage  of  nursing  staff  is  a  chronic  problem  in  hospitals.  along  with  this  is  the  added  burden  of  unexpected  emergencies.  hospitals  always  face  a  shortage  of  staff  during  emergencies  and  operations  when  they  are  most
__label__logisticstracking needed.  providing  rfid  tags  in  wristbands  or  id  cards  to  nursing  staff  helps  the  hospital  to  track  their  location  within  the  hospital  and  call  them  in  case  of  sudden  emergency.  the  delegation  of  responsibility  or  reassignment  of  tasks  is  also  easy  when  such  staff  tracking  is  enabled  by  iot.  staff  also  form  an  integral  part  of  a  hospitals  assets  and  iot  helps  to  manage  these  assets  efficiently  to  provide  the  best  patient  service  in  hospitals.  of  all  the  assets  of  a  hospital,  a  patient  is  the  most  important  one.  iot  helps  to  assimilate  and  track  patient  information  constantly  at  hospitals
__label__logisticstracking to  offer  them  optimum  healthcare.  patients  are  provided  with  intelligent  jackets  or  rfid  wristbands  which  help  to  record  their  vital  parameters  like  height,  weight,  blood  group  etc.  sensors  are  used  for  realtime  monitoring  of  crucial  health  parameters  like  blood  glucose  level,  heartbeat,  breathing  rate  etc.  all  the  patient  information  is  integrated  and  available  at  all  times  through  electronic  health  records  ehr.  this  type  of  asset  management  helps  physicians  in  quicker  decision  making  and  facilitates  better  service  to  patients.  patient  safety  should  be  the  prime  concern  of  hospitals.  this  is  accomplished  by  the  effective  use  of  iot.  elderly  patients  with  dementia
__label__logisticstracking can  be  prevented  from  wandering  off  by  equipping  them  with  rfid  tagged  wristbands.  pregnant  ladies  can  avoid  waiting  in  queues  by  equip  themselves  with  sensors  that  monitor  their  health  parameters  and  tags  that  helps  to  locate  them  when  the  testing  laboratory  is  free.  infants  can  also  be  monitored  in  the  same  manner  with  the  help  of  these  iot  devices.  iot  also  helps  in  total  hygiene  compliance  at  hospitals  by  monitoring  which  doctors  and  nurses  are  in  contact  with  infected  patients  and  enforcing  sanitation  measures  on  them.  this  ensures  isolation  of  infection  and  avoids  its  propagation.  asset  management  and  tracking  should

__label__logisticstracking the  growing  developments  in  the  internet  of  things  iot  have  many  exciting  implications  for  the  future  of  healthcare.  connected  technology  is  entering  our  homes  and  workplaces,  so  it  follows  that  healthcare  may  benefit  from  its  dataprocessing  abilities.  benefits  include  more  timely  decisionmaking  and  hopefully  the  overall  goal  better  patient  outcomes.  read  below  for  the  top  5  iot  use  cases  in  healthcare:  get  our  quick  guide  to  challenges  for  iot  in  healthcare  here  before  the  introduction  of  connectivity  and  iot  in  healthcare,  its  fair  to  say  that  a  lot  less  monitoring  of  patients  was  going  on  outside  of  a  hospital  setting
__label__logisticstracking it  just  wasnt  possible.  so  if  you  were  admitted  to  the  hospital,  youd  be  very  closely  monitored  while  there,  but  once  discharged,  no  one  would  know  what  was  happening  with  you  outside  of  checkups.  the  problem  with  this  is  that  a  lot  of  issues  can  develop  once  a  patient  has  been  discharged,  and  often  these  are  things  that  could  be  prevented  or  minimized  if  doctors  had  early  access  to  outpatient  data.  iot  has  a  vital  role  to  play  in  remote  healthcare  and  monitoring.  data  can  be  captured  via  sensors  in  medical  devices  and  shared  in  real  time  with  physicians.  serious
__label__logisticstracking conditions  can  be  prevented  from  developing,  while  a  chronic  disease  can  be  monitored  for  progress.  for  example,  key  indicators  such  as  blood  pressure,  glucose  levels  and  weight  can  be  monitored  remotely.  there  are  a  number  of  new  sensors  that  have  been  built  to  monitor  other  potential  early  indicators  of  problems.  for  example,  fall  alerts  for  senior  citizens  or  to  pick  up  signs  of  emotional  distress  in  patients.  these  indicators  are  important  for  physicians  to  understand  early  on  if  there  may  be  any  escalation  in  symptoms  of  a  chronic  disease.  there  are  three  ways  in  which  iot  in  healthcare  can  help

__label__logisticstracking and  iot  applications,  which  traditionally  fit  more  in  a  consumer  context  e.g.  personal  health  trackers  get  an  increasing  place  in  the  relationship  between  consumer/patient  and  healthcare  providers  and  payers.  patient  engagement  and  consumer  consciousness  play  an  important  role  here  and  in  the  relationship  with  healthcare  payers  also  incentives  and  premiums  do  compare  with  the  use  of  telematics  in  in  insurance  .  outside  of  this  scope  there  is  major  growth  ahead  in  a  more  context,  whereby  healthcare  providers,  such  as  hospitals,  leverage  iot,  in  combination  with  applications  and  technologies  in  the  field  of  robotics,  artificial  intelligence  and  big  data.  the  second

__label__logisticstracking segments.  iot,  from  an  enablement  perspective,  is  a  cornerstone  of  the  digital  transformation  of  healthcare  until  at  least  the  next  decade.  as  healthrelated  data  is  collected  and  increasingly  is  available  in  realtime,  it  gets  integrated  with  electronic  healthcare  records  ehr.  ehr  systems  are  far  from  omnipresent  and  most  have  not  been  designed  with  the  internet  of  things,  rfid  and  realtime  data  in  mind;  they  have  been  designed,  if  all  is  well,  to  make  healthcare  faster,  more  patientcentric,  more  affordable  and  better  from  the  perspective  of  the  patients  health  and  the  work  of  healthcare  professionals,  based  on  rather  static  data.  these
__label__logisticstracking outcomes  are  also  essential  in  many  iot  use  cases  in  healthcare,  yet  they  are  not  always  achieved.  moreover,  there  are  so  many  approaches  to  the  digitization  of  healthcare  records  that  in  practice  an  internet  of  things  deployment  needs  to  take  into  account  these  differences  if  it  is  related  with  an  individual  patient.  not  all  health  data  from  connected  devices  ultimately  lands  in  the  ehr/emr  environment.  there  are  plenty  of  other  information  systems  and  systems  of  insight,  depending  on  type  of  data,  device,  scope  and  purpose.  moreover,  there  is  a  shift  towards  realtime  health  systems  rths,  which  go  beyond  ehr  and
__label__logisticstracking include  awareness  and  realtime  data  capabilities  in  an  iot  and  connected/wearable  device  perspective.  ehr  systems  are  part  of  the  broader  context  and  processes  within  this  rths  systems  approach.  according  to  rths  will  be  a  key  area  for  iot  in  healthcare  as  big  data  analytics  tools  and  processes  are  utilized  to  evaluate  both  dynamic  and  static  data  for  predictive  analytics  as  part  of  comprehensive  healthcare  systems  improvement  programs.  its  the  data  that  makes  sense  to  improve  the  lives  of  patients  and  the  organization  of  healthcare  across  its  various  aspects  such  as  the  ability  for  doctors,  specialists,  nurses  and  staff  to  make
__label__logisticstracking better  decisions  faster.  moreover,  security  and  privacy  by  design  need  to  be  part  of  any  iot  use  case,  project  or  deployment.  leveraging  the  iot  and  data  aims  to  improve  and  reduce  errors  and  costs.  making  sure  it  doesnt  get  exposed  or  used  for  the  wrong  reasons  is  key.  as  mentioned  in  other  articles,  personal  healthcare  data  needs  to  be  treated  differently  from  a  security  and  compliance  perspective.  at  the  same  time,  healthcare  organizations  need  to  pay  more  attention  to  compliance  as  well,  certainly  in  regions  where  stricter  regulations  are  being  put  into  place  such  as  the  eu  where  personal  health
__label__logisticstracking data,  as  well  as  genetic  and  other  medical  and  biological  data,  get  special  attention  and  are  seen  as  very  sensitive.  it  is  clear  that  any  iot  project  which  involves  personal  health  data,  needs  to  take  these  rules  and  the  lawfulness,  intent,  and  diffusion  stipulations,  to  name  a  few,  into  account.  as  a  matter  of  fact,  any  iot  project  should  have  security  and  privacy  by  design  in  mind  where  it  concerns  .  however,  the  positions  with  regards  to  the  protection  and  leverage  of  health  data  is,  to  put  it  mildly,  very  different  if  you  start  comparing  initiatives  and  regulations  across  the
__label__logisticstracking globe.  taking  all  the  above  into  account  lets  take  a  look  at  the  major  use  cases  today  and,  next,  the  rapidly  emerging  use  cases  in  the  near  future.  there  is  a  general  shift  of  care  in  hospitals  or  emergency  care  environments  to  private  environments  such  as  the  patients  home,  whenever  that  becomes  possible.  its  a  matter  of  costs,  its  a  matter  of  getting  the  patient  back  to  his  normal  environment  and  its  one  way  to  reduce  the  workload  of  healthcare  workers  who  in  many  countries  and  many  periods  simply  cant  cope.  in  some  countries  the  lack  of  funding  and,  as
__label__logisticstracking a  result,  shortage  of  healthcare  workers,  specifically  in  and  after  seasons  where  more  diseases  strike,  is  a  recurring  yearly  disaster.  remote  health  monitoring,  which  is  obviously  very  possible  thanks  to  the  internet  of  things,  also  partially  helps  solve  the  rise  of  chronic  diseases,  among  others  due  to  an  aging  population  but  not  just  that.  remote  health  monitoring  is  also  ideal  when  patients  live  in  remote  areas.  there  is  a  broad  range  of  specialized  wearables  and  biosensors,  along  with  other  medical  devices,  available  today  that  enables  remote  health  monitoring.  remote  health  monitoring  also  offers  healthcare  stakeholders  the  possibility  to  detect  patterns,
__label__logisticstracking leveraging  the  data  coming  from  these  wearables  and  other  devices.  this  enables  new  insights  and  visualizations  of  patterns  as  the  combination  of  big  data,  analytics,  iot  and  so  forth  tends  to  do.  it  is  one  reason  why  the  skillsets  of,  for  example,  hospital  staff,  are  changing.  in  practice,  as  budgets  in  healthcare  are  restricting,  this  could  lead  to  concerns  from  a  human  care  perspective.  speaking  about  hospitals,  there  is  a  set  of  iot  use  cases  which  brings  us  back  from  the  remote  aspect  to  hospitals  and  other  .  on  the  most  essential  level,  which  we  touched  upon  earlier,  we  are
__label__logisticstracking speaking  about  rfid  and  iotenabled  devices,  iotenabled  assets  and  rather  traditional  general  iot  use  cases  which  are  really  crossindustry  such  as  predictive  maintenance  of  hospital  assets,  connected  healthcare  devices  and  the  tracking  of  healthcare  devices  and  people.  it  isnt  really  a  surprise  that  this  is  an  ongoing  evolution,  which  on  other  levels,  also  includes  phenomena  such  as  smart  beds,  the  aggregation  and  realtime  availability  of  data  from  healthcare  devices  and  assets  regarding  specific  patients,  and  the  advent  of  robots  in  a  hospital  environment  for  routine  tasks.  in  such  assetintensive  environments  which  at  the  same  time  are  extremely  informationintensive,  ample  possibilities
__label__logisticstracking and  potential  outcomes  emerge  when  leveraging  iot  and  related  sets  of  technologies.  in  a  crossindustry  perspective  we  can  certainly  also  mention  smart  buildings  and  facility  management  here.  if  there  is  one  place  where  the  various  building  parameters  think  about  temperature,  humidity,  air  regulation,  specific  environmental  controls,  security  and  so  forth  need  to  be  optimal,  it  for  sure  is  the  hospital.  according  to  the  previously  mentioned  in  healthcare  and  more,  the  main  iot  use  case  in  healthcare  organizations  is  monitoring  and  maintenance  73  percent  of  respondents  ,  followed  by  remote  operation  and  control  50  percent  of  respondents  .  connecting  iot  devices

__label__logisticstracking an  interview  about  the  future  of  health  tech,  some  of  the  developments  we  see  have  stopped  people  being  tied  to  their  house,  or  kept  them  from  being  regularly  in  hospital.  theyre  solving  what  are  in  some  cases  quite  simple  problems,  and  giving  people  that  quality  of  life  back.  technology  makes  your  interaction  with  your  medical  professional  much  more  powerful  and  useful,  and  puts  you  more  in  control.  diabetes  has  proven  to  be  a  fertile  ground  for  the  development  of  smart  devices,  as  a  condition  that  affects  roughly  one  in  ten  adults,  and  one  that  requires  continual  monitoring  and  administration  of
__label__logisticstracking treatment.  a  continuous  glucose  monitor  cgm  is  a  device  that  helps  diabetics  to  continuously  monitor  their  blood  glucose  levels  for  several  days  at  a  time,  by  taking  readings  at  regular  intervals.  the  first  cgm  system  was  approved  by  the  us  food  and  drug  administration  fda  in  1999,  and  in  recent  years,  a  number  of  smart  cgms  have  hit  the  market.  smart  cgms  like  eversense  and  freestyle  libre  send  data  on  blood  glucose  levels  to  an  app  on  iphone,  android  or  apple  watch,  allowing  the  wearer  to  easily  check  their  information  and  detect  trends.  the  freestyle  librelink  app  also  allows  for

__label__logisticstracking or  pen  caps  like  gocap,  inpen  and  esysta  have  the  ability  to  automatically  record  the  time,  amount  and  type  of  insulin  injected  in  a  dose,  and  recommend  the  correct  type  of  insulin  injection  at  the  right  time.  the  devices  interact  with  a  smartphone  app  that  can  store  longterm  data,  help  diabetes  patients  calculate  their  insulin  dose,  and  even  in  the  case  of  the  gocap  allow  patients  to  record  their  meals  and  blood  sugar  levels,  to  see  how  their  food  and  insulin  intake  are  affecting  their  blood  sugar.  one  of  the  most  fascinating  areas  in  iot  medicine  is  the  opensource  initiative
__label__logisticstracking openaps,  which  stands  for  open  artificial  pancreas  system.  openaps  is  a  type  of  closedloop  insulin  delivery  system,  which  differs  from  a  cgm  in  that  as  well  as  gauging  the  amount  of  glucose  in  a  patients  bloodstream,  it  also  delivers  insulin  thus  closing  the  loop.  openaps  was  started  in  2015  by  dana  lewis  and  her  husband  scott  leibrand,  who  hacked  danas  cgm  and  her  insulin  pump  in  order  to  automate  the  delivery  of  insulin  into  her  system.  using  the  data  feed  from  the  cgm  and  a  raspberry  pi  computer,  their  own  software  completes  the  loop  and  continuously  alters  the  amount  of
__label__logisticstracking insulin  danas  pump  delivers.  automating  insulin  delivery  offers  a  number  of  benefits  that  can  change  the  lives  of  diabetics.  by  monitoring  an  individuals  blood  glucose  levels  and  automatically  adjusting  the  amount  of  insulin  delivered  into  their  system,  the  aps  helps  to  keep  blood  glucose  within  a  safe  range,  preventing  extreme  highs  and  lows  otherwise  known  as  hyperglycaemia  excessively  high  glucose  and  hypoglycaemia  excessively  low  glucose.  the  automatic  delivery  of  insulin  also  allows  diabetics  to  sleep  through  the  night  without  the  danger  of  their  blood  sugar  dropping  also  known  as  nighttime  hypoglycaemia.  although  openaps  is  not  an  out  of  the  box
__label__logisticstracking solution  and  requires  people  to  be  willing  to  build  their  own  system,  it  is  attracting  a  growing  community  of  diabetics  who  are  using  its  free  and  opensource  technology  to  hack  their  insulin  delivery.  the  openaps  website  ,  as  of  january  15,  2018,  there  are  more  than  n11,078  individuals  around  the  world  with  various  types  of  diy  closed  loop  implementations.  the  openaps  community  arent  the  only  ones  to  have  had  this  idea.  in  2013,  bryan  mazlish,  a  father  with  a  wife  and  young  son  who  both  have  type  1  diabetes,  created  the  first  automated  and  cloudconnected  closedloop  artificial  pancreas  device.  in

__label__logisticstracking are  an  ambitious  application  of  the  internet  of  things  in  a  healthcare  context.  while  the  concept  has  a  great  deal  of  potential,  so  far,  the  science  hasnt  always  managed  to  live  up  to  expectations.  in  2014,  google  life  sciences  now  known  as  verily,  a  subsidiary  of  googles  parent  company  alphabet  announced  it  would  be  developing  a  smart  contact  lens  that  could  measure  tear  glucose  and  provide  an  early  warning  system  for  diabetics  to  alert  them  when  their  blood  glucose  levels  had  dropped  or  risen  beyond  a  certain  threshold.  it  partnered  with  alcon,  the  eyecare  division  of  pharmaceutical  company  novartis,  for
__label__logisticstracking the  project.  however,  the  project  attracted  a  great  deal  of  scepticism  from  researchers  who  believed  that  the  idea  of  measuring  blood  glucose  levels  via  tears  wasnt  scientifically  sound  and  ultimately,  they  were  proven  correct.  after  a  lengthy  period  with  no  real  news  about  project  developments,  in  november  2018  verily  .  but  other  medical  applications  for  smart  contact  lenses  might  prove  more  successful.  verily  is  still  working  on  two  smart  lens  programs  with  alcon,  which  aim  to  treat  presbyopia  longsightedness  caused  by  a  loss  of  elasticity  in  the  lens  of  an  eye  and  cataract  surgery  recovery.  swiss  company  sensimed  has  also
__label__logisticstracking developed  a  noninvasive  smart  contact  lens  called  triggerfish,  which  automatically  records  changes  in  eye  dimensions  that  can  lead  to  glaucoma.  first  developed  in  2010,  triggerfish  is  now  cemarked  and  fdaapproved,  meaning  it  is  approved  for  marketing  and  sale  in  europe  and  the  u.s.,  and  was  in  september  2018.  wearable  technology  doesnt  always  have  to  be  designed  with  a  medical  use  in  mind  to  have  healthcare  benefits.  takeda  pharmaceuticals  u.s.a.  and  cognition  kit  limited,  a  platform  for  measuring  cognitive  health,  collaborated  in  2017  to  explore  the  use  of  an  apple  watch  app  for  monitoring  and  assessing  patients  with  major  depressive  disorder
__label__logisticstracking mdd.  the  results  from  the  exploratory  study  were  at  pharma  and  biotech  conference  cns  summit.  the  study  found  a  very  high  level  of  compliance  with  the  app,  which  participants  used  daily  to  monitor  their  mood  and  cognition.  the  apps  daily  assessments  were  also  found  to  correspond  with  more  indepth  and  objective  cognition  tests  and  patientreported  outcomes,  showing  that  cognitive  tests  delivered  via  an  app  can  still  be  robust  and  reliable.  while  the  study  was  only  an  exploratory  pilot,  it  has  demonstrated  the  potential  for  wearable  tech  to  be  used  to  assess  the  effects  of  depression  in  realtime.  like  other  smart
__label__logisticstracking medical  devices  that  gather  data,  the  apple  watch  app  could  also  give  patients  and  healthcare  professionals  more  insight  into  their  condition,  and  enable  more  informed  conversations  about  care.  in  2016,  roche  launched  a  that  allows  patients  to  check  how  quickly  their  blood  clots.  this  is  the  first  device  of  its  kind  for  anticoagulated  patients,  with  selftesting  shown  to  help  patients  stay  within  their  therapeutic  range  and  lower  the  risk  of  stroke  or  bleeding.  being  able  to  transmit  results  to  healthcare  providers  means  fewer  visits  to  the  clinic.  the  device  also  allows  patients  to  add  comments  to  their  results,  reminds  them

__label__logisticstracking languages,  tools,  structural  e.g.  patterns  of  architecture  and  design,  ethical  e.g.  governmental  privacy  protection  standards.  for  example,  in  2013  the  u.s.  food  and  drug  administration  fda  released  its  rule  for  unique  device  identification  system  for  medical  devices,  which  will  help  in  organizing  adverse  event  reporting  by  making  recalls  more  straightforward  in  an  effort  to  improve  patient  safety  .  the  rule  centers  around  two  core  items,  the  first  of  which  requires  a  unique  number  to  be  assigned  to  every  model  of  a  medical  device.  secondly,  the  rule  will  create  a  public  database  of  medical  devices.  the  fda  hopes  these  steps  will

__label__logisticstracking nots  for  healthcare  by  defining  general  classes  of  system  types,  classifying  the  healthcare  delivery  settings,  then  using  the  structured  approach  to  describing  the  elements  for  a  particular  use  case.  we  illustrate  the  approach  for  three  use  cases  and  discuss  certain  issues  that  arise.  we  also  discuss  considerations  for  dominant  quality  requirements  in  iots  for  healthcare.  healthcare  can  be  delivered  in  three  broadbased  setting  types:  acute  care,  communitybased  care  and  longterm  care.  acute  care  refers  to  a  hospital  setting  where  the  caregivers  are  paid  health  care  professionals.  communitybased  care  is  delivered  in  a  home  setting,  where  the  patient  is  living  in
__label__logisticstracking his  or  her  own  or  anothers  home  and  where  caregivers  are  either  paid  professionals  or  unpaid  family  members  or  friends.  longterm  care  refers  to  nursing  homes,  or  other  skilled  nursing  facilities  where  patients  reside  for  weeks,  months,  years  or  for  the  remainder  of  their  lives  and  where  caregivers  are  paid  professionals.  iots  can  be  used  to  collect  patient  and  other  data  in  these  settings,  and  aggregate  the  data  using  analytics  and  then  reporting  this  information  to  caregivers  and/or  take  some  action  such  as  shutting  down  a  faulty  medical  device.  it  would  be  futile  to  try  to  enumerate  all  conceivable  iot
__label__logisticstracking applications  in  healthcare  since  after  completing  any  list  new  applications  will  be  innovated.  instead  we  define  three  classes  of  use  cases  of  healthcare  iots:  a  tracking  humans  e.g.  patients,  caregivers,  and  family  members,  b  tracking  things  e.g.  medical  devices,  supplies,  and  specimens,  c  tracking  humans  and  things.  class  a  systems  involve  tracking  humans  data  e.g.  patients,  caregivers,  family  members  using  iot  devices.  perhaps  the  most  mature  field  for  iot  in  health  care  is  patient  datagathering.  currently,  telemetry  monitors  can  automatically  measure  and  send  or  upload  ekg  stats,  core  body  temperature  cbt,  blood  pressure,  urine  output,  etc.  by  monitoring  these  vital
__label__logisticstracking signs,  healthcare  professionals  can  detect  and  start  care  earlier  for  infectious  disease,  cancer,  heart  failure,  etc.  another  example  in  this  class  involves  tracking  the  physical  location  of  patients  in  any  setting  acute,  longterm,  home.  from  tracking  wandering  patients  admitted  to  er  to  tracking  patients  with  dementia,  the  iot  could  geolocate  patients  with  alzheimers  disease,  or  selfdestructive  behaviors  such  as  bulimia,  cutting,  or  suicidal  tendencies.  such  tracking  can  already  be  accomplished  with  commercial  gps  bracelets,  but  local  proximity  sensors  connected  through  internet  or  cloud  based  technologies  could  allow  tracking  inside  of  the  facility  or  home,  or  outside  these  where  gps  signals
__label__logisticstracking may  not  reach.  additionally  health  care  providers  working  in  high  risk  areas,  such  as  mental  health  care,  may  benefit  from  tracking  for  security  reasons.  the  second  class  of  systems  involves  tracking  things  in  a  healthcare  setting  in  realtime.  these  could  include  medical  devices,  supplies,  specimens  and  more.  for  example  certain  shared  equipment  found  in  hospitals  is  scarce  e.g.  ekg  machines,  intravenous  pumps,  intermittent  pressure  devices  for  prevention  of  thrombosis.  nurses  and  hospital  staff  may  sometimes  store  the  equipment  so  that  they  can  access  it  when  needed,  however  this  can  create  a  problem  if  another  unit  is  in  need  of  this
__label__logisticstracking equipment  but  cannot  locate  it.  iot  could  be  used  to  track  the  location  of  such  equipment.  for  example  airfinder  is  a  realtime  location  system  for  hospitals  and  other  enterprises  that  uses  symphony  link  technology  to  track  supplies  in  an  operating  room  or  throughout  an  entire  hospital  or  facility.  in  acute  settings;  future  iot  technology  can  also  provide  an  analysis  of  the  use  patterns  of  hospital  supplies  or  devices  to  assist  particular  units  in  documenting  use  and  need  for  additional  equipment  and  acuity  of  patients.  in  a  communitybased  setting  sensors  could  be  placed  to  monitor  usage  patterns.  for  example,  oxygen  tanks
__label__logisticstracking or  medication  administration  devices;  iot  could  assist  in  tracking  the  usage  and  need  for  replacement  of  supplies.  most  equipment  has  alarm  features  for  various  exceptions  e.g.  readings  exceed  limits,  refill,  failure,  time  to  calibrate,  etc..  frequent  equipment  alarms  can  cause  nurses  and  staff  to  become  desensitized  to  the  alarms  so  called  alarm  fatigue  such  that  they  do  not  react  quickly  enough  to  deal  with  the  exception.  a  not  could  be  used  to  help  differentiate  these  alarms  for  more  effective  response  scenarios  and  send  the  alarm  to  the  appropriate  health  care  providers  who  should  respond.  the  applications  in  class  c  involve
__label__logisticstracking a  hybrid  of  classes  a  and  b.  taking  the  dimensions  of  care  settings  and  iot  application  classes  yields  9  general  use  cases:  acute  a,  b,  c,  longterm  a,  b,  c,  home  a,  b,  c.  to  illustrate  how  the  general  framework  helps  describe  these  healthcare  iot  applications,  we  consider  three  use  cases  involving:  a  patient  with  an  alcoholic  addiction,  a  patient  with  alzheimers  disease,  and  staff  or  patient  safety  issue  or  concerns  in  a  hospital  setting  in  each  case  we  describe  the  situation  from  a  healthcare  providers  perspective  then  using  the  framework  established,  showing  how  a  specialized  iot  could  assist  in
__label__logisticstracking monitoring  and  patient  care.  alcoholism  is  a  longterm  chronic  disease  in  which  a  person  has  developed  an  unhealthy  dependence  on  alcohol  .  in  the  u.s.,  there  are  close  to  14  million  people  who  are  either  alcohol  abusers  or  alcoholics  .  fortunately,  no  matter  how  severe  the  problem  may  seem,  most  people  with  an  alcohol  use  disorder  can  benefit  from  some  form  of  treatment.  research  shows  that  about  onethird  of  people  who  are  treated  for  alcohol  problems  have  no  further  symptoms  1  year  later.  many  others  substantially  reduce  their  drinking  and  report  fewer  alcoholrelated  problems  .  in  the  early  stages  of

__label__logisticstracking symptoms  is  essential  to  adjust  the  treatment.  matching  the  right  therapy  to  the  individual  is  important  to  its  success.  no  single  treatment  will  benefit  everyone  in  the  alcoholism  case.  many  of  the  above  aws  symptoms  could  potentially  be  monitored  using  a  specialized  not  or  noninternetenabled  analytics.  for  example,  a  patient  with  aws  needs  to  be  carefully  monitored  regarding  trembling  and  irregular  movement.  sensors  can  be  strategically  placed  in  the  patients  home  and  used  to  pick  up  on  accelerated  and  irregular  walking  or  movement  activity  as  compared  to  walking  or  moving  at  a  normal  pace.  in  addition  a  patient  can  be
__label__logisticstracking monitored  for  episodes  of  vomiting  by  observing  instances  of  bathroom  use  via  an  iot.  a  sensor  that  can  detect  the  odor  of  vomit  could  provide  additional  cues  in  the  diagnosis  and  management  of  the  aws  patient  in  homecare  settings.  a  not  system  can  render  a  decision  on  the  existence  of  aws  symptoms  and  the  degree  of  such  symptoms.  if  a  patient  has  mild  to  moderate  withdrawal  symptoms,  a  healthcare  provider  may  prefer  to  continue  the  treatment  in  an  outpatient  setting  while  prescribing  some  medications  to  reduce  the  severity  of  the  symptoms,  especially  if  a  patient  has  supportive  family  and  friends.
__label__logisticstracking if  the  symptoms  are  extremely  severe,  then  the  system  may  alert  the  case  as  a  medical  emergency  that  requires  an  acute  setting.  depicts  a  simple  construct  for  an  aws  patient  in  a  longterm  or  home  care  setting  using  an  iot.  aws  use  case  construct  e  alzheimers  disease  is  the  most  common  form  of  dementia,  accounting  for  60  to  80  of  all  cases  .  alzheimers.org  reports  that  1  in  9  people  age  of  65  years  and  older  has  alzheimers  disease.  it  is  important  to  note  too  that  81  of  people  with  alzheimers  disease  are  age  75  or  older.  safety  is  a
__label__logisticstracking key  factor  in  the  care  of  patients  with  dementia.  also,  the  average  lifespan  in  general  for  all  people  continues  to  rise,  with  many  surviving  into  their  80s  and  90s.  the  costs  associated  with  care  of  the  patient  with  alzheimers  disease  are  staggering.  all  of  these  statistics  highlight  the  need  for  technologies  to  assist  in  monitoring  and  support  of  these  patients,  their  families  or  caregivers,  and  health  care  providers.  there  are  a  variety  of  symptoms  that  a  patient  with  alzheimers  disease  can  exhibit,  some  are  more  common  in  early  stages  while  others  appear  later  as  the  disease  progresses.  with  the  number
__label__logisticstracking of  cases  of  the  disease  continually  on  the  rise,  the  health  care  community  has  been  seeking  ways  to  assure  safety  and  quality  of  life  for  the  patient  and  caregivers.  caregiver  burden  is  a  real  concern  because  of  the  stress  and  level  of  care  often  needed,  with  most  of  this  responsibility  falling  to  family  or  caregivers.  as  the  disease  progresses  the  patient  can  have  difficulty  walking  and  swallowing  that  will  require  additional  monitoring  and  intervention  to  keep  the  patient  safe.  the  following  are  common  symptoms  of  alzheimers  disease:  memory  loss  that  disrupts  daily  life;  challenges  in  planning  or  solving  problems;  difficulty
__label__logisticstracking completing  familiar  tasks  at  home,  at  work  or  at  leisure;  confusion  with  time  or  place;  trouble  understanding  visual  images  and  spatial  relationships;  new  problems  with  words  in  speaking  or  writing;  misplacing  things  and  losing  the  ability  to  retrace  steps;  decreased  or  poor  judgment,  withdrawal  from  work  or  social  activities;  changes  in  mood  and  personality,  including  apathy  and  depression  .  any  of  these  symptoms  could  potentially  be  monitored  using  a  specialized  iot  or  other  analytics,  though  some  would  be  more  difficult  than  others.  as  the  disease  progresses,  cognitive  and  functional  abilities  can  decline.  people  may  need  help  with  basic  activities  such
__label__logisticstracking as  bathing,  dressing,  eating  and  using  the  bathroom;  lose  their  ability  to  communicate;  fail  to  recognize  loved  ones;  and  become  bedbound  and  reliant  on  24  hour  care.  when  individuals  have  difficulty  moving,  they  are  more  vulnerable  to  infections,  including  pneumonia  which  is  often  a  contributing  factor  to  the  death  of  people  with  alzheimers  disease  .  clearly  this  disease  takes  a  toll  on  the  patient  and  caregivers,  and  it  is  easy  to  see  the  need  for  technologies  to  assist  caregivers  at  different  stages  of  the  disease.  allowing  the  patient  with  alzheimers  disease  the  best  quality  of  life  is  a  focus  of
__label__logisticstracking care.  especially  in  early  stages,  patients  need  to  maintain  a  level  of  independence  therefore  caregivers  and  health  care  providers  must  seek  ways  to  keep  the  patient  safe  without  taking  away  all  independence.  additionally,  it  is  important  for  the  patient  with  alzheimers  disease  to  remain  socially  engaged  to  stimulate  brain  health;  the  sensors  again  can  be  placed  to  avoid  detection  by  visitors.  many  patients  with  alzheimers  disease  also  have  comorbidities  or  disesases  or  conditions,  therefore  a  sensor  may  also  capture  data  for  monitoring  of  other  health  conditions,  such  as  hypertension  high  blood  pressure.  monitoring  through  sensors  with  iot  can  be  a
__label__logisticstracking means  to  do  this.  the  sensors  could  be  strategically  placed  to  capture  important  data,  but  not  be  intrusive.  a  study  by  niemeijer  et  al.  provided  evidence  to  support  the  development  of  less  intrusive  forms  of  patient  monitoring.  gps  tracking  devices  and  video  surveillance  were  two  technologies  included  in  this  study,  as  these  have  been  touted  to  increase  freedom  for  patients  with  alzheimers  disease  .  this  ethnographic  study  interestingly  resulted  in  two  themes,  with  the  second  theme  highlighting  that  patients  felt  stigmatized  and  felt  they  were  being  watched.  sensors  could  be  built  into  residential  communities  in  order  to  be  better  accepted.
__label__logisticstracking for  example,  radiofrequency  identification  rfid  chips  could  be  inconspicuously  embedded  in  the  patients  clothing  for  the  purposes  of  position  tracking.  local  proximity  sensors  could  track  the  location  and  movement  of  patients.  health  care  providers  could  be  notified  of  emergency  situations,  possibly  even  linking  an  alert  to  local  first  responders.  sensors  could  be  placed  in  areas  to  detect  movement  and  vital  signs.  if  the  patient  is  becoming  more  confused  and  is  wandering,  the  sensor  could  detect  a  pattern  of  wandering.  if  the  patient  is  becoming  agitated,  the  sensor  could  be  placed  to  detect  increased  heart  rate  or  blood  pressure;  also  assisting
__label__logisticstracking in  detection  of  vital  signs  related  to  comorbidities.  by  contrast,  if  there  is  a  sudden  drop  in  activity,  this  could  signal  apathy  or  depression  of  a  patient  who  perhaps  is  becoming  more  sedentary  and  less  social.  a  simple  construct  for  an  alzheimers  patient  in  an  acute  or  longterm  or  home  care  setting  using  an  iot  in  shown  in  .  alzheimers  use  case  construct  e  privacy  becomes  a  real  issue  here,  however  as  patient  information  is  potentially  being  disclosed  outside  of  the  immediate  care  providers  and  across  insecure  technologies.  safety  and  violence  are  currently  very  important  issues  in  health.  there  are
__label__logisticstracking numerous  accounts  of  horizontal  violence,  for  example  nurse  against  nurse,  but  also  of  violence  from  visitors  or  family  towards  health  care  providers.  the  bureau  of  labor  statistics  bls  reported  that  2010  experienced  a  13  increase  in  workplace  violence  over  that  for  2009  .  the  violence  ranged  from  verbal  threats  to  homicide,  and  the  bls  states  that  there  are  likely  many  more  incidents  that  go  unreported.  the  bls  stresses  the  need  for  a  zero  tolerance  policy,  with  education  of  all  staff  and  providers.  a  not  could  be  integral  to  a  zero  tolerance  policy  by  providing  another  layer  of  protection.  for  example,
__label__logisticstracking proximity  sensors  with  an  appropriate  aggregation  algorithm  could  be  used  to  detect  signs  of  aggression  or  stress  in  individuals.  a  simple  construct  for  a  patient  or  caregiver  safety  use  case  using  an  iot  is  shown  in  .  rfid  chips  could  be  embedded  in  the  lab  coats  of  personnel  and  in  the  garments  of  patients  in  high  risk  areas,  such  as  mental  health  facilities.  while  these  implementations  raise  numerous  collateral  questions,  such  as  the  ethics  of  monitoring  providers,  the  possibilities  for  implementation  solutions  seem  to  be  within  reach.  safety  use  case  construct  e  health  care  institutions  are  equipped  with  video  surveillance
__label__logisticstracking systems,  however,  the  question  arises  as  to  whether  other  means,  such  as  metal  detectors,  in  conjunction  with  an  appropriate  iot  could  provide  additional  protection  against  violence  with  a  gun,  knife  or  other  weapons.  health  care  providers  have  debated  this  notion,  with  some  believing  metal  detectors  are  against  the  culture  of  the  acute  care  environment  because  they  are  perceived  as  prison  equipment  however  others  support  their  use.  when  specifying  the  functionality  for  iot  healthcare  applications,  attention  is  naturally  focused  on  concerns  such  as  fitness  of  purpose,  wireless  interoperability,  energy  efficiency,  and  so  on.  conventional  requirements  elicitations  techniques  such  as  domain  analysis,
__label__logisticstracking joint  application  development  jad,  and  quality  function  deployment  qfd  among  others  are  usually  adequate  for  these  kinds  of  requirements.  but  in  healthcare  iot  applications  some  quality  requirements  are  probably  of  greater  concern.  three  particular  quality  requirements  namely  security,  safety  and  caring  are  of  special  importance  in  healthcare  applications  because  of  the  sensitive,  personal  nature  of  the  information.  we  explore  these  types  of  requirements  further  in  this  section.  privacy  concerns  have  always  been  a  crucial  aspect  of  health  care.  patients  expect  that  their  personally  identifiable  information  will  remain  confidential  and  that  health  care  providers  will  protect  them.  similarly,  iotbased  healthcare  systems
__label__logisticstracking must  assure  privacy  but  allow  for  sharing  of  information  that  is  needed  to  provide  high  quality  care  across  the  care  continuum.  many  of  the  devices  used  in  a  provisioned,  specialized  iot  will  collect  various  data  whether  that  surveillance  is  known  or  not  .  if  so,  where  does  that  data  go?  who  owns  it?  and  why  is  it  being  collected  in  the  first  place?  sensors  and  surveillance  will  be  huge  concerns  to  overcome  in  order  to  argue  convincingly  for  compliance  when  the  economic  benefits  to  healthcare  providers  are  overwhelming  for  this  technology.  the  health  insurance  portability  and  accountability  act  hipaa  of
__label__logisticstracking 1996  addresses  how  a  patients  personal  health  information  can  be  used  and  shared  to  assure  privacy  but  to  allow  for  sharing  of  information  that  is  needed  to  provide  high  quality  care.  hipaa  is  an  integral  part  of  todays  health  care  system,  and  no  health  care  provider  would  argue  its  relevance.  new  concerns,  however,  have  been  raised  as  to  the  relationship  of  hipaa  and  the  iot.  a  forbes  magazine  report  calls  for  new  federal  baseline  privacy  legislation,  builtin  security  for  iot  devices,  data  minimization  storing  less,  not  more  data  and  security  breach  notification  .  in  february  2016,  the  office  of  the
__label__logisticstracking privacy  commissioner  of  canada  released  a  34page  report  outlining  concerns  for  privacy  and  data  as  the  iots  continues  to  take  shape:  the  internet  of  things  has  been  compared  to  electricity,  or  a  nervous  system  for  the  planet,  to  illustrate  phenomena  that  are  at  once  pervasive,  unseen  and  will  become  crucially  integrated  within  the  fabric  of  our  society,  states  the  report.  several  international  experts,  thinkers  and  technology  builders  are  forecasting  profound  political,  social  and  economic  transformations;  concerns  about  privacy  and  surveillance  are  chief  among  them.  there  has  also  been  a  substantial  amount  of  academic  research  considering  iot  functionality  versus  privacy.  for
__label__logisticstracking example,  winter  conducted  a  survey  of  hawaiin  healthcare  consumers  in  order  to  identify  specific  practices  that  will  be  brought  about  by  the  iots  that  may  be  perceived  as  privacy  violations  .  essentially,  winter  found  that  these  consumers  were  willing  to  trade  off  some  privacy  for  the  perceived  benefits  of  information  sharing.  moreover,  thierer  argues  against  rash,  restrictive  regulation  in  response  to  security  and  privacy  concerns  that  could  thwart  innovation  in  applications  including  healthcare  related  to  wearable  iot  technologies  .  and  walla  discusses  some  of  the  issues  of  patient  privacy  in  internet  hosted  personal  records  that  are  not  covered  by  hipaa
__label__logisticstracking and  mercuri  considers  regulations  intended  to  improve  health  care  data  access  have  created  new  security  and  privacy  risks  along  with  regulatory  complexity  for  patients  and  practitioners  .  safety  concerns  address  questions  such  as:  is  the  system  operating  as  intended?  is  the  system  providing  needed  levels  of  care?  is  it  providing  unintended  functionality?  can  a  malfunction  of  the  system  harm  a  patient?  safety  requirements  for  medical  systems  often  derive  from  oversight  agencies,  for  example,  in  the  united  states,  the  food  and  drug  administration  fda.  wallace  and  kuhn  studied  342  failures  in  medical  devices  based  on  data  from  the  fda.  their  study
__label__logisticstracking helped  identify  approaches  for  using  fault  and  failure  information  to  improve  device  safety  .  they  also  found  that  known  best  practices  may  not  be  used  at  all  or  may  be  misused.  wallace  and  kuhn  also  recommended  that  for  requirements  generation  of  safe  medical  devices  that  engineers  should  gather  failure  and  fault  data  from  previous  and  related  systems,  understand  the  types  of  faults  that  are  prevalent  for  a  specific  domain,  and  develop  prevention  and  detection  approaches  specific  to  these  issues  .  the  us  underwriters  laboratories  proposed  a  faulttree  analysis  approach  for  specifying  hazards  in  wearable  devices  ,  and  this  approach  would
__label__logisticstracking be  appropriate  for  other  medical  and  healthcare  applications  using  iot  technology.  using  traditional  techniques  for  defining  misuse  and  abuse  cases  would  also  be  appropriate.  caring  can  be  described  as  an  act,  or  a  way  to  approach  a  patient.  caring  can  be  a  trait  that  one  possesses,  and  often  an  adjective  to  describe  what  is  perceived  to  be  a  good  caregiver.  most  nurses  will  be  able  to  articulate  their  concept  of  caring  if  asked.  lachman  highlights  the  pervasiveness  of  the  link  between  nurses  and  caring  by  pointing  out  that  caring  and  nursing  are  so  intertwined  that  nursing  always  appeared  on  the
__label__logisticstracking same  page  in  a  google  search  for  the  definition  of  caring  .  for  our  purposes,  we  adopt  caring  as  an  adjective  functional  quality  with  the  following  definition:  displaying  kindness  and  concern  for  others  .  caring  likely  encompasses  elements  of  the  qualities  of  trust,  reliability,  privacy  and  more,  but  none  of  these,  by  themselves,  capture  the  full  essence  of  caring.  instead,  caring  is  a  super  ility  resulting  as  some  composite  of  other  ilities  and  the  system  quality  called  empathy.  one  possible  hierarchical  representation  for  caring  in  terms  of  these  other  ilities  is  given  in  .  a  hierarchy  of  qualities  related  to
__label__logisticstracking caring.  other  types  of  systems  may  contain  additional  subqualities  e.g.  usability,  availability  forming  a  slightly  different  hierarchy  than  that  in  .  since  caring  is  comprised  of  some  combination  of  other  qualities  that  differ  for  each  stakeholder  and  each  system  we  find  it  convenient  to  express  caring  for  a  given  system  as  a  linear  combination  of  these  constituent  qualities,  which  is:  ,  where  the  qi,  are  quantifiable  values  for  the  subqualities  related  to  caring:  such  as  safety,  trust,  reliability,  and  the  a  are  weighting  coefficients  for  these  qualities.  for  each  system  c  will  be  a  secret  sauce  with  the  target  goals
__label__logisticstracking for  the  q  ,  related  to  system  requirements  to  be  specified.  caring  also  means  different  things  to  different  people  and  for  different  systems.  consider  for  example,  a  robotic  surgery  system.  these  systems  are  now  used  extensively  for  many  types  of  procedures  including  heart,  cancer  and  prostate  surgery.  while  current  systems  are  robotic  in  the  sense  that  the  machine  mimics  the  movements  of  a  human  surgeon,  fully  autonomous  robot  surgical  systems  are  envisioned  in  the  near  future,  replacing  surgeons  and  nurses  in  the  operating  room  or  .  while  we  expect  the  human  surgeon  and  nurses  to  care  about  the  patient,  as
__label__logisticstracking systems  engineers,  what  should  we  require  of  a  fully  autonomous  robot  surgeon?  furthermore,  what  should  the  patient  expect,  in  terms  of  a  caring  system,  especially  since  the  patient  may  be  unconscious  during  the  procedure?  their  concerns  are  likely  somewhat  different.  consider,  for  example,  the  constituent  qualities  of  caring  in  the  robotic  surgery  system.  the  surgeon  wants  the  system  to  be  safe  and  reliable,  likely,  as  the  primary  concerns.  both  the  safe  and  trustworthy  operation  of  the  system  contribute  to  a  sense  of  reliability  in  the  system  and  are  of  concern  to  the  systems  engineers.  the  patient  shares  these  concerns  but
__label__logisticstracking also  wants  the  system  to  preserve  his  privacy  e.g.  by  not  exposing  medical  records  or  embarrassing  images.  if  the  actors  in  the  or  were  humans,  the  patient  would  probably  also  expect  a  sense  of  empathy  from  the  surgeons  or  nurses.  of  course,  robot  surgeons  look  nothing  like  human  surgeons,  therefore  there  would  need  to  be  a  means  by  which  the  robots  could  emote  empathy  via  speech  or  facial  expression  generation  on  some  display  device.  these  diverse  concerns,  with  respect  to  the  qualities  related  to  caring,  will  inform  the  specific  system  requirements  discovery  and  representation  process.  very  little  work  has  been
__label__logisticstracking done  to  explore  empathy  in  computing  systems  in  comparison  to  other  subqualities  of  caring.  brave  et  al  showed  that  empathic  emotion  via  facial  expression  in  a  computer  agent  interacting  with  a  patient,  has  significant  positive  effects  on  users  opinions  of  that  agent.  they  noted  that  just  as  people  respond  to  being  cared  about  by  other  people,  users  respond  positively  to  agents  that  care.  further  they  observed  that  the  positive  impression  of  caring  was  due  to  the  other  oriented  nature  of  empathic  emotion;  selforiented  emotion  was  found  to  have  little  or  no  effect  on  users  opinions  of  the  agent  .  in
__label__logisticstracking another  study  huang  et  al  integrated  carpers  nursing  typology  ways  of  knowing  and  locsins  nursing  theory  to  define  the  five  senses  of  a  caring  robot.  these  five  senses  or  qualities  are:  accurate  recognition  of  nurses  instruction,  confirmation  of  nurses  instruction,  mid  to  highlevel  conversation  competency,  motion  competency,  and  the  ability  to  demonstrate  empathy,  which  they  defined  as  a  behavioral  ability  to  convey  empathy  to  a  patient  .  most  other  research  that  we  found  in  affective  computing  investigated  very  specific  examples  implementations  of  technology  and  a  situation  for  example  detecting  a  patient  fall  using  wearable  devices  .  since  many  different  definitions
__label__logisticstracking of  caring  exist,  it  is  important  to  engage  all  stakeholders  when  trying  to  define  a  notion  of  caring  for  a  new  healthcare  system  and  it  is  critically  important  to  engage  systems  engineers,  computer  scientists,  doctors,  nurses  and  most  importantly  patients  during  requirements  discovery.  many  traditional  requirements  elicitation  techniques  could  be  used  to  uncover  caring  and  related  requirements  depending  on  the  size  of  the  system.  the  most  likely  useful  elicitation  techniques  for  caring  and  related  qualities,  however,  include  surveys,  interviews,  prototyping  executable  and  nonexecutable,  ethnographic  observation,  designer  as  apprentice  .  of  course,  different  elicitation  techniques  may  be  used  with  different  stakeholder
__label__logisticstracking groups,  and  multiple,  complementary  techniques  should  be  used  with  each  group.  for  example,  since  empathy  can  be  expressed  via  emoticons  e.g.  brave  et  al  prototyping  of  various  facial  feature  displays,  or  voice  outputs  could  be  used  to  generate  empathy  requirements.  interviews  and  surveys  of  patients  could  be  used  to  capture  desired  caregiver  behaviors  e.g.  verbal  cues,  event  triggered  behaviors  that  support  patients  in  their  belief  that  the  healthcare  system  is  trustworthy  and  safe.  ethnographic  observation  and  designer  as  apprentice  could  also  be  used  to  elicit  caring  requirements  by  recording  and  analyzing  the  behaviors  and  movements  of  caregivers  who  are  rated
__label__logisticstracking highly  along  the  dimension  of  caring  there  are  instruments  available  from  nursing  theory  such  as  the  caritas  tool  to  do  such  measurement  .  each  quality  requirement  specification  should  be  unambiguous  and  testable.  in  ,  the  authors  suggest  to  use  a  common  form  to  specify  quality  attributes  expressions.  the  form  has  six  parts:  stimulus,  stimulus  source,  response,  response  measure,  environment  and  artifact.  in  order  to  provide  a  guidance  to  requirements  engineers  when  specifying  caring  expressions,  a  set  of  possible  values  for  each  of  the  six  parts  is  needed.  this  is  a  venue  of  research  that  we  aim  to  pursue.  of  course,
__label__logisticstracking caring  and  related  requirements  that  have  been  specified  and  delivered  successfully  in  built  systems  could  be  reused  in  related  systems  and  in  product  lines.  other  caring  and  related  requirements  may  emerge  from  laws  and  regulations,  for  example  in  the  robotic  surgery  system  case,  hipaa.  finally,  other  requirements  for  caring  and  related  qualities  will  eventually  emerge  as  standards  and  reference  architectures  are  developed  for  applicable  systems  e.g.  smart  healthcare.  in  this  paper  we  introduced  a  structured  framework  for  describing,  and  later  help  in  specifying,  designing  and  implementing  healthcare  iots.  the  approach  involved  defining  general  classes  of  system  types,  classifying  the  healthcare

__label__logisticstracking a  few  years  ago,  i  was  working  with  an  engine  manufacturing  company  and  the  said  engines  typically  used  in  large  vehicles  fleet.  at  that  time,  when  iot  was  just  a  buzzword,  this  forwardthinking  company  had  implemented  initially  remote  monitoring  diagnostics,  and  later  fullscale  iot  solution  which  helped  them  remotely  monitor  and  analyse  the  critical  engine  parameters  along  with  diagnostics  fault  codes  and  further  invehicle  data  acquisitions,  and  later  integrated  field  engineer  optimization  and  spare  part  management  with  integrated  fleet  management  solution.  this  information  helped  them  tremendously  in  product  innovation.  typically,  the  driving  style  and  driver  behavior  greatly  affect  the  fuel
__label__logisticstracking efficiency.  things  like  unnecessary  idling,  accelerating  and  decelerating  patterns,  breaking  habits,  average  speed  and  so  on  affect  the  fuel  efficiency.  using  iot,  fleet  managers  can  track  all  such  data  through  embedded  sensors  and  work  with  the  drivers  to  improve  the  fuel  efficiency.  through  various  sensors,  fleet  companies  have  access  to  vast  amount  of  data  which  they  can  analyze  to  gain  actionable  insights  into  the  adherence  to  laws  by  drivers,  vehicle  speeding  and  idling,  and  driving  patterns  and  so  on.  this  information  can  help  the  companies  make  realtime  quick  decisions  for  instant  improvements.  in  fact,  these  insights  can  also  help  in
__label__logisticstracking effectively  managing  the  overall  supply  chain.  iot  in  fleet  management  allows  the  fleet  operators  to  automate  various  processes  and  trip  planning.  for  example:  if  a  vehicle  breaks  down  then  the  system  can  send  automatic  ticket  notification  to  tow  trucks  and  nearest  service  stations.  in  the  case  of  weather  warnings,  automatic  notifications  can  be  sent  to  drivers  to  help  them  in  rerouting  etc.  i  had  a  wonderful  experience  of  interacting  with  various  state  transport  bodies  in  context  to  proposing  solutions  and  in  turn  helping  them  design  intelligent  transport  systems.  based  on  the  gathered  data  about  the  route,  traffic,  vehicle  speed,  number

__label__logisticstracking the  internet  of  things  iot  is  not  the  futureit  is  now  .  and,  of  all  the  industries  seeking  to  harness  the  power  of  internet  connected  sensors  and  devices,  logistics  and  transportation  are  perhaps  seeing  the  clearest  and  most  immediate  benefits  to  deploying  this  technology  in  their  fleets.  its  not  just  big  companies  that  are  utilizing  iot  devices  eithersmall  companies  too  can  find  affordable  software  and  hardware  solutions  that  will  improve  how  their  fleets  operate.  lets  take  a  deep  dive  into  it,  shall  we?  iots  role  in  fleet  management  is  pretty  straightforward.  it  all  starts  with  sensors  and  devices  embedded  in
__label__logisticstracking the  vehicles  and  the  data  they  are  capturing.  depending  on  the  type  of  data  a  fleet  manager  wants  to  analyze,  they  would  need  to  equip  their  trucks  with  the  appropriate  hardware  sensors.  this  can  include:  in  general,  every  truck  can  be  equipped  with  hardware  sensors  that  track  driver  behavior  and  fuel  efficiency,  but  in  order  to  track  maintenance,  the  truck  will  likely  need  to  have  those  sensors  already  installed.  the  data  collected  by  these  sensors  is  automatically  uploaded  to  the  cloud,  where  it  can  then  be  converted  into  useful  analytics  with  traditional  .  now  that  we  understand  how  it  works,
__label__logisticstracking lets  consider  how  we  can  use  this  data  to  make  smarter  decisions.  as  data  is  collected  in  real  time,  fleet  managers  can  use  it  to  coach  their  drivers.  truck  driver  going  too  fast?  tell  him  to  slow  down.  burning  too  much  fuel  while  idling?  tell  him  to  turn  off  the  engine  if  hes  going  to  be  stopped  for  more  than  a  few  minutes.  in  addition  to  realtime  coaching,  collecting  this  data  allows  fleet  managers  to  make  better  informed  decisions.  for  example,  some  drivers  simply  drive  better  in  certain  vehicles  along  particular  routes.  this  data  could  allow  the  fleet  manager  to
__label__logisticstracking assign  the  best  drivers  to  the  routes  and  vehicles  they  are  best  suited  for.  finally,  using  iot  sensors  to  capture  data  can  lead  to  significant  cost  savings.  consider  the  fact  that  most  trucks  consume  fuel  at  the  paltry  rate  of  roughly  five  miles  per  gallon.  with  better  data  regarding  how  their  fuel  is  consumed,  even  an  additional  mile  per  gallon  through  more  intelligent  fuel  consumption  can  lead  to  massive  savings.  huge  news  broke  in  the  fleet  management  world  when,  earlier  this  summer,  telecom  giant  verizon  acquired  fleet  management  vendors  and  .  these  are  complementary  pairings,  indeed:  verizon  boasts  the  best
__label__logisticstracking wireless  network,  according  to  some  reports,  and  the  acquisitions  no  doubt  solidify  the  companys  place  as  a  dominant  force  among  enterprise  cloud  services  for  logistics  firms.  while  some  fleet  management  companies  are  getting  snatched  up,  others  are  playing  catch  up.  in  the  past,  there  was  no  hardware  to  collect  and  send  data  back  to  the  office;  fleet  management  software  was  completely  disconnected  from  the  actual  fleet.  to  remain  relevant,  fleet  management  software  vendors  have  had  to  improve  and  expand  their  pairings  with  iot  hardware  devices.  when  shopping  for  new  fleet  management  software,  be  sure  to  ask  about  any  iot  integrations
__label__logisticstracking prospective  vendors  offer.  workwaves  route  planning  feature  were  watching  a  major  transformation  in  the  trucking  industry  take  place.  smaller  trucking  firms  that  arent  adapting  simply  wont  be  able  remain  afloat  without  giving  serious  consideration  to  revamping  their  back  office  analytics  and  how  they  are  collecting  data  about  their  trucks.  weve  written  quite  a  bit  about  autonomous  trucking  in  the  past,  and  suffice  it  to  say,  it  is  the  most  logical  conclusion  for  what  the  iotequipped  truck  will  eventually  become:  intelligent  robots  on  18  wheels.  but  before  we  get  to  that  point,  we  can  expect  a  few  things  to  happen:  the

__label__logisticstracking fleets  through  iot  are  obvious.  and,  there  are  new  benefits  that  are  emerging  with  the  arrival  of  powerful  technologies  that  attach  the  fleet  to  the  cloud.  its  easier,  and  more  critical,  than  ever  before  for  fleet  managers  to  capitalize  on  iot.  fleets  are  necessary  for  many  businesses  to  operate.  yet,  they  can  be  time  consuming  and  expensive  to  operate.  companies  that  fully  embrace  iot  are  poised  to  optimize  costs  and  reduce  expenses,  gain  greater  visibility  and  control,  achieve  cleaner  and  more  efficient  operations,  improve  the  health  of  the  fleet  through  preventative  maintenance  and,  most  importantly,  gain  access  to  a  vast
__label__logisticstracking amount  of  data  that  can  be  used  to  analyze  performance  and  grow  the  business  and  the  bottom  line.  ask  any  fleet  manager  why  theyre  adopting  iot,  and  the  first  thing  theyre  likely  to  list  is  savings.  all  fleet  managers  must  optimize  their  costs  and  ensure  that  the  budget  associated  with  the  fleet  is  used  wisely.  iot  connects  all  devices,  drivers  and  vehicles  to  the  cloud  where  data  can  be  stored  and  new  efficiencies  identified.  fleet  managers  can  better  understand  how  dollars  are  spent  and  can  identify  areas  in  which  money  can  be  saved  through  data  captured  by  cloudconnected  devices.  for
__label__logisticstracking example,  iot  can  give  a  realtime  view  of  how  many  miles  are  actually  being  driven,  thereby  helping  companies  maximize  their  mileage  tax  deduction.  in  a  by  ultimarc,  the  average  number  of  miles  driven  by  lightduty  4x2  or  4x4  trucks  ranges  between  11,000  and  13,000  per  year  in  the  u.s.  this  represents  a  tax  deduction  of  up  to  7020  per  vehicle  at  the  2016  u.s.  standard  mileage  deduction  rate.  closely  tied  to  number  of  miles  driven  is  the  efficiency  of  those  miles.  each  mile  driven  can  be  optimized  through  efficient  route  planning  that  considers  required  stops,  traffic  and  weather.  better  routes
__label__logisticstracking mean  that  fleet  managers  can  get  the  most  productivity  out  of  every  mile.  iot  lets  fleet  managers  see  if  drivers  are  making  unnecessary  stops  or  driving  recklessly.  they  can  determine  whether  fuel  is  being  wasted  by  leaving  the  engine  running  or  by  taking  inefficient  routes.  it  makes  it  possible  for  fleet  managers  to  know  where  vehicles  and  drivers  are  at  all  times,  identify  potential  problems,  and  mitigate  risks  that  can  impact  driver  safety,  customer  service,  or  increased  cost.  green  operations  are  also  a  concern  to  most  fleet  managers.  this  is  not  only  because  co2  emissions  are  bad  for  the  environment,
__label__logisticstracking but  because  of  the  cost  of  wasted  fuel  and  unnecessary  vehicle  use  hits  the  bottom  line.  regulations  and  compliance  concerns  also  drive  the  need  for  more  efficiency  through  fleet  operations.  driving  over  the  speed  limit,  taking  a  longer  route  than  necessary,  or  excessive  idling  contributes  to  waste  and  to  co2  emissions.  according  to  the  ,  each  year  light  and  medium  duty  trucks  consume  over  8  billion  gallons  of  fuel  and  emit  an  average  of  over  13  metric  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  per  vehicle.  the  edf  goes  on  to  suggest  that  these  vehicles  should  be  equipped  with  vehicle  routing  and  tracking
__label__logisticstracking software  to  ensure  that  they  use  the  most  efficient  routes  and  maintain  schedulesespecially  for  fleets  whose  vehicles  travel  a  dense,  multistop  route.  every  fleet  manager  knows  that  preventative  maintenance  is  much  more  cost  effective  than  the  alternative.  in  addition  to  gaining  better  insight  into  driver  behavior  and  vehicle  use,  iot  makes  it  possible  to  monitor  the  health  of  any  vehicle  in  realtime  and  from  any  location.  alerts  for  services  like  low  battery,  check  engine  lights,  inspection  reminders,  prescheduled  maintenance,  coolant  and  oil  change  reminders  and  even  current  fuel  efficiency  gives  fleet  managers  the  information  they  need  to  optimize  fleet  health
__label__logisticstracking and  prevent  expensive  breakdowns.  one  of  the  most  important  benefits  of  iotbased  fleet  management  is  the  vast  amount  of  data  that  is  gathered  in  realtime.  by  analyzing  historical,  current  and  peer  data,  fleet  managers  can  benchmark  current  performance,  identify  new  opportunities,  and  reduce  costs.  data  can  be  analyzed  and  fed  back  to  the  driver  to  help  them  optimize  their  performance  while  theyre  in  route.  aggregate  data  about  fleet  performance  can  help  companies  identify  trends,  pinpoint  trouble  spots  and  reduce  costs.  predictive  maintenance  costs  and  average  annual  fuel  consumption  can  be  calculated  in  advance  and  budgeted  for,  with  fewer  surprises.  and,
__label__logisticstracking with  data,  decisions  can  be  made  about  overall  fleet  health  and  vehicle  retirement  and  replacement  strategies.  most  iot  solutions,  like  mapanything  live,  also  leverage  thirdparty  data  stores  like  information  contained  in  service  management  software.  as  data  is  gathered  within  these  systems,  analytics  and  predictive  signals  become  more  accurate,  therefore  revealing  new  opportunities  for  overall  fleet  performance  improvements.  iot  is  a  breakthrough  for  fleet  managers,  and  puts  the  power  of  the  internet  into  every  vehicle  and  asset  that  comprise  the  fleet.  the  resulting  cost  savings,  environmental  benefits,  driver  safety  and  customer  satisfaction  make  iot  an  essential  investment  for  these  organizations.  to
