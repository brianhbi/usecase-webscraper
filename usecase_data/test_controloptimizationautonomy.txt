__label__controloptimizationautonomy gateways,  and  by  connecting  battlefield  assets  back  to  headquarters.  through  sharing  data  between  both  legacy  assets  and  new  deployments,  this  military  vision  creates  advantages  through  force  projection  and  secure  timely  exchanges  of  information  between  users.  the  ncw  paradigm  integrates  three  domains:  the  physical  domain,  generating  data  where  events  happen  and  operations  are  conducted;  the  information  domain,  in  which  data  are  transmitted  and  stored;  and  the  cognitive  domain,  in  which  data  are  processed  and  analyzed  supporting  decisionmaking.  the  three  domains  of  ncw  translate  directly  into  the  foundations  of  todays  commercial  iot.  consequently,  this  driving  paradigm  has  led  to  the  adoption  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy iotrelated  technologies  in  key  areas.  today,  military  and  homeland  security  are  struggling  to  equip  its  workforce  with  the  basic  functions  provided  by  cots  technologies,  i.e.,  commercial  smart  phones  or  radiofrequency  identification  rfid.  indeed,  defense  continues  to  drive  innovation  regarding  advanced  sensors,  surveillance  and  reconnaissance  drones,  satellite  communication  systems,  and  control  systems,  and  has  invested  significantly  in  mobile  technologies,  including  tactical  mobility  for  warfighters.  nevertheless,  the  vast  majority  of  current  iot  applications  are  driven  by  the  private  sector,  with  the  military  severely  lagging  behind  in  everyday  operations.  defense  has  today  an  opportunity  to  seize  benefits  from  iot  by  partnering  with  the

__label__controloptimizationautonomy has  achieved  significant  benefits  that  can  be  leveraged  by  the  military.  they  include  transportation,  energy  efficiency,  inventory  managements,  or  mining.  transportation:  telogis  ,  which  builds  enginemonitoring  systems  for  general  motors  gm  vehicles,  estimates  that  its  smart  engine  reduces  fuel  consumption  by  25,  around  30  in  idle  time,  increases  fleet  use  by  25,  and  workforce  productivity  by  15.  energy  efficiency:  iotbased  energy  management  systems  can  reduce  energy  use  in  office  by  20  .  smart  thermostats  and  hvac  heating,  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  save  consumers  as  much  as  1015  on  heating  and  cooling.  additionally,  smart  appliances  for  home  automation  systems  are  now
__label__controloptimizationautonomy being  researched  .  iotbased  use  cases  for  smart  cities  have  been  also  identified,  like  traffic  monitoring  ,  surveillance  and  pollution  monitoring  .  within  this  scenario,  the  content  of  the  samples  acquired  may  expose  critical  information.  for  example,  in  the  case  of  noise  pollution  monitoring  applications,  the  noise  may  also  contain  private  conversations.  inventory  management:  ustranscoms  global  transportation  network  gtn  and  dla  defense  logistics  agency  developed  a  common  information  platform  that  enables  the  military  to  improve  endtoend  supply  visibility,  service  and  logistics  processes.  the  platform  includes  a  single  repository  and  universal  access  to  logistics  data  so  that  any  user  or  developer
__label__controloptimizationautonomy can  easily  access  or  manage  supply  chain  information.  also,  such  a  platform  facilitates  the  development  of  new  applications  that  run  on  the  same  backbone.  another  contribution  of  ustranscom  is  fleet  management,  which  uses  rfid  trackers  to  monitor  palletized  shipments  among  major  transit  hubs.  mining:  embedded  sensors  on  equipment  and  vehicles  offer  a  more  precise  picture  of  ground  operations  and  enable  realtime  monitoring  of  equipment.  this  new  technology,  together  with  autonomous  mining  systems,  is  transforming  daily  operations.  an  iot  deployment  reduces  expenditure  on  infrastructure  and  machines  by  reducing  outages  and  maintenance,  energy  consumption  and  environmental  impact,  while  significantly  improving  productivity  and
__label__controloptimizationautonomy mine  safety  by  reducing  injuries  and  fatalities.  a  renowned  example  is  the  autonomous  drilling  system  of  rio  tinto  perth,  australia,  which  includes  tunneling  machines,  trains,  autonomous  haulage  systems,  and  driverless  trucks.  this  missioncontrol  site  manages  operations  of  15  mines,  31  pits,  4  port  terminals  and  a  1600  km  rail  network  .  the  abovementioned  examples  illustrate  some  of  the  ways  in  which  the  private  sector  is  leveraging  iot  and  enabling  new  business  models.  today,  european  research  projects  like  rerum  ,  relyonit  ,  fiestaiot  ,  bigiot  ,  or  blotope  intend  to  tackle  the  most  relevant  shortcomings  of  commercial  iot.  among  the  different
__label__controloptimizationautonomy projects,  eufunded  metisii  must  be  highlighted:  the  researchers  created  a  5g  radioaccess  network  design  and  provided  the  technical  enablers  needed  for  an  efficient  integration.  other  concerns,  like  environmental  issues  or  green  deployment  schemes  for  iot  ,  still  remain  open.  in  this  section  we  provide  an  overview  of  the  most  promising  iot  scenarios,  which  are  depicted  in  .  until  now,  the  deployment  of  iotrelated  technologies  for  defense  and  public  safety  has  been  essentially  focused  on  applications  for  command,  control,  communications,  computers,  intelligence,  surveillance  and  reconnaissance  c4isr,  and  firecontrol  systems.  this  is  driven  by  a  predominant  view  that  sensors  serve  foremost  as

__label__controloptimizationautonomy ground,  and  manned  or  unmanned  vehicles  or  soldiers.  these  devices  examine  the  mission  landscape  and  feed  data  to  a  forward  base.  some  of  the  data  may  be  relayed  to  a  command  center  where  it  is  integrated  with  data  from  other  sources.  c4isr  systems  use  millions  of  sensors  deployed  on  a  range  of  platforms  to  provide  advanced  situational  awareness.  radar,  video,  infrared  or  passive  rf  detection  data  are  gathered  by  surveillance  satellites,  airborne  platforms,  uavs  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  ground  stations,  and  soldiers  in  the  field.  these  data  are  delivered  to  an  integration  platform  that  analyzes  them  and  delivers  information  up  and
__label__controloptimizationautonomy down  the  chain  of  command.  these  platforms  provide  a  common  operational  picture  cop  allowing  for  enhanced  coordination  and  control  across  the  field.  highlevel  military  echelons  are  provided  with  comprehensive  situational  awareness  through  central  operations  centers,  which  receive  data  feeds  from  platforms.  lower  levels  i.e.,  platoon,  soldiers  also  have  access  to  the  data  in  their  area.  in  the  case  of  combat  pilots,  they  receive  prioritized  data  feeds  integrated  with  data  from  their  own  sensor  systems.  in  firecontrol  systems,  endtoend  deployment  of  sensor  networks  and  digital  analytics  enable  fully  automated  responses  to  realtime  threats,  and  deliver  firepower  with  pinpoint  precision.  for  example,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  u.s.  navys  aegis  combat  system  provides  c2  as  well  as  an  unprecedented  ballistic  missile  defense  .  munitions  can  also  be  networked,  allowing  smart  weapons  to  track  mobile  targets  or  be  redirected  in  flight.  prime  examples  are  the  tomahawk  land  attack  missile  tlam  and  its  variants,  navys  precision  strike  standoff  weapons  for  attack  of  long  range,  medium  range  and  tactical  targets  .  furthermore,  the  military  has  invested  in  the  use  of  long  endurance  uavs  to  engage  highvalue  targets  and  introduce  multiuavs  applications  .  logistics  is  an  area  where  multiple  lowlevel  sensors  are  already  being  used  in  defense.  currently,  their  deployment
__label__controloptimizationautonomy remains  constrained  to  benign  environments  with  infrastructure  and  human  involvement.  the  military  has  already  deployed  some  iot  technologies  in  noncombat  scenarios  in  order  to  improve  backend  processes.  for  example,  rfid  tags  have  been  used  to  track  shipments  and  manage  inventories  between  central  logistics  hubs.  in  the  following  subsections,  we  describe  examples  that  belong  to  two  main  categories:  fleet  management  and  individual  supplies.  fleet  monitoring  can  be  represented  by  aircraft  and  ground  vehicle  fleets  with  onboard  sensors  that  monitor  performance  and  part  status.  for  example,  they  track  vehicle  status  and  subsystems,  and  indicate  when  resupplying  lowstock  items  i.e.,  fuel  or  oil
__label__controloptimizationautonomy is  needed.  sensors  would  issue  alerts,  potentially  reducing  the  risk  of  fatal  failures.  the  aim  is  to  facilitate  conditionbased  maintenance  and  ondemand  ordering  of  parts,  reduce  maintenance  staff,  and  decrease  unanticipated  failures  or  unnecessary  part  replacements.  although  iot  deployment  carries  upfront  costs,  it  can  enable  significant  longterm  savings  by  transforming  business  processes  across  logistics.  defense  has  an  opportunity  to  take  advantage  in  the  auto  and  industrial  sectors,  and  exploit  performance  data  on  existing  data  links,  like  blue  force  tracker  transponders  already  in  place  on  many  military  vehicles  to  limit  new  security  risks.  by  extension,  iotconnected  vehicles  could  also  share  information,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy for  example,  about  available  spare  parts.  realtime  fleet  management  includes  geolocation,  status  monitoring,  speed  and  engine  status,  total  engine  hours,  fuel  efficiency,  and  weight  and  cargo  sensors.  besides,  when  tracking  shipments,  the  position  and  status  of  the  containers  can  be  monitored  to  identify  potential  problems.  regarding  aircraft,  modern  jet  engines  are  equipped  with  sensors  that  produce  several  terabytes  of  data  per  flight.  this  information  combined  with  inflight  data  can  improve  engine  performance  to  reduce  fuel  costs,  detect  minor  faults  or  shorten  travel  duration  .  furthermore,  it  enables  preventive  maintenance  resulting  in  a  long  lifecycle  slowing  or  preventing  breakage  and  less
__label__controloptimizationautonomy downtime  spent  in  repairs.  the  flight  data  can  be  tracked  in  realtime  by  operators  and  analysts  on  the  ground.  the  deployment  of  rfid  tags,  sensors  and  standardized  barcodes  allow  for  tracking  individual  supplies.  iot  provides  realtime  supply  chain  visibility  whether  it  is  being  shipped,  transferred,  deployed,  consumed  ,  and  allows  the  military  to  order  supplies  on  demand  and  simplify  logistics  management  for  operational  units.  this  smarter  procurement  of  goods  avoids  delays  caused  by  outofstock  parts  or  inventorycarrying  costs.  likewise,  it  can  increase  accountability,  enhance  mission  reliability,  reduce  losses  and  theft  of  military  equipment,  and  help  with  the  time  criticality  on
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  military  maintenance.  at  the  soldier  level,  tracking  is  useful  in  order  to  follow  a  proactive  approach  to  logistics  or  to  meet  operational  requirements.  soldier  material  e.g.,  water,  food,  batteries  or  bullets  can  be  monitored  with  alerts  issued  for  a  necessary  resupply.  aggregate  data  e.g.,  groups  of  soldiers,  companies,  battalions  might  also  be  studied  for  further  enhancements  of  supply  for  tactical  and  emergency  units.  the  analytics  might  be  focused  on  considering  environment,  body  type,  consumption  among  other  variables.  in  denied  area  environments,  existing  iot  infrastructures  could  be  reused  in  military  operations.  ambient  sensors  can  be  used  to  monitor  the  existence
__label__controloptimizationautonomy of  dangerous  chemicals.  sensors  monitoring  human  behavior  may  be  used  to  assess  the  presence  of  people  acting  in  a  suspicious  way.  leveraging  information  provided  by  preexisting  infrastructures  might  be  critical.  several  security  issues  may  arise,  such  as  equipment  sabotage  or  deceptive  information.  the  authors  of  categorize  such  attacks  into  four  areas:  1  system  architecture,  firewalls,  software  patches;  2  malware,  security  policies  and  human  factors;  3  thirdparty  chains  and  insider  threat;  and  4  database  schemas  and  encryption  technologies.  bodyworn  devices  are  increasingly  available  ,  .  fitness  trackers  enable  monitoring  of  physical  activity  along  with  vital  signs.  this  information  has  an  obvious

__label__controloptimizationautonomy collaborative  sensing  involves  sharing  sensing  data  among  mobile  devices  combined  with  robust  short  range  communications.  iot  nodes  would  be  able  to  utilize  placement  or  other  sensors  to  supplement  their  own  sensing  methods.  once  security  issues  such  as  trust  and  authentication  are  resolved,  the  information  can  be  made  available  to  the  users.  longterm  maintenance  of  iot  services  yield  multiple  benefits,  such  as  trend  or  fault  detection.  individual  sensor  parameters  must  be  considered  to  assign  a  particular  relevance  to  a  given  reporting  device  and  its  feedback  can  be  improved  upon  data  fusion  approaches.  iot  can  ease  adhoc  missionfocused  intelligence,  surveillance  and  reconnaissance
__label__controloptimizationautonomy isr  via  pairing  sensors  with  mission  assignments  .  thus,  sensors  and  sensor  platforms  would  not  have  to  be  burdened  with  excessive  equipment  to  handle  mission  scenarios  on  their  own.  for  example,  multiple  devices  entering  an  area  of  interest,  each  with  their  own  mission  but  relying  on  collaborative  sensing  to  accommodate  new  or  unanticipated  requirements.  in  the  case  of  a  soldier,  its  situational  awareness  increases,  allowing  for  improved  survival  and  mission  success.  resourcerich  devices  might  collect  data  from  several  sources  to  form  a  cop.  this  would  allow  for  storing  much  of  the  collection  and  for  processing  the  data  locally.  higher  level
__label__controloptimizationautonomy functions  would  aid  reducing  response  times,  improving  decisionmaking  and  reducing  backhaul  communications  requirements.  crowdsensing  promises  to  be  an  inexpensive  tool  for  flexible  real  time  monitoring  of  large  areas  and  assessment  for  mission  impact,  hence  complementing  services  potentially  available  in  smart  cities.  researchers  have  devised  services  that  allow  for  decoupling  applications  from  the  hardware  .  crowdsensing  services  might  offer  both  recruitment  devices  that  should  be  instructed  to  perform  sensing  and  data  collections  the  system  returns  data  directly.  these  applications  entail  challenges.  first,  there  is  a  large  number  of  users  that  have  to  served  while  offering  them  tangible  benefits  or  incentives  .
__label__controloptimizationautonomy secondly,  they  are  required  to  ensure  a  desired  level  of  quality  of  the  data  collected.  from  the  perspective  of  gathering  data  from  a  community,  deception  could  be  achieved  by  compromising  individual  devices.  consequently,  the  security  level  is  proportionate  to  the  number  of  present  devices,  each  representing  a  possible  attack  vector.  moreover,  the  paradigm  bring  your  own  device  byod  introduces  potential  security  concerns,  since  the  user  may  have  full  access  and  make  use  of  multiple  heterogeneous  devices  that  are  difficult  to  control.  data  validation  is  another  domaindependent  task  in  the  context  of  crowd  sending,  and,  likewise,  it  is  further  complicated  by
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  high  heterogeneity  of  the  devices.  even  individual  devices  may  vary  in  capabilities  and  performance  over  time.  for  example,  for  a  smart  phone,  low  battery  levels  could  lead  to  infrequent  gps  position  updates,  thus  resulting  in  geotagging  errors.  approaches  to  ensure  data  quality  often  rely  on  oversampling  and  filtering  of  outlier  values  ,  reputation  schemes  that  provide  trustworthy  sensing  for  public  safety  ,  or  trust  networkbased  human  intervention  approaches.  moreover,  potential  threats  to  privacy  can  compromise  crowdsensing  services.  many  of  these  activities  require  geotagging  and  timestamps,  which  can  lead  to  disclosing  the  locations  visited  by  the  users.  another  privacy  issue
__label__controloptimizationautonomy is  the  metadata  collected  about  devices  performing  a  sensing  activity.  the  u.s.  dod  is  already  reducing  its  demand  on  facility  energy  by  investing  in  efficiency  projects  on  its  installations  .  the  introduction  of  data  and  predictive  algorithms  can  help  to  understand  usage  patterns  better  and  significantly  decrease  militarys  energy  costs.  security  cameras  and  sensors,  combined  with  sophisticated  image  analysis  and  pattern  recognition  software,  ease  remote  facility  monitoring  for  security  threats.  in  the  case  of  marine  and  coastal  surveillance,  using  different  kinds  of  sensors  integrated  in  planes,  unmanned  aerial  vehicles,  satellites  and  ships,  make  possible  to  control  the  maritime  activities  and

__label__controloptimizationautonomy iot  applications.  in  this  section  a  set  of  operational  requirements  grouped  by  capabilities  represented  in  are  assessed  in  order  to  cover  the  scenarios  previously  discussed.  operational  capabilities  assessed  to  cover  missioncritical  scenarios.  one  of  the  biggest  constraints  in  a  battlefield  environment  is  power  consumption.  iot  devices  are  likely  to  be  powered  by  batteries  or  solar  power,  and  charged  onthemove  from  solar  panels,  trucks,  or  even  by  motion  while  walking.  in  either  case,  they  should  last  for  extended  periods  of  time  at  least  for  the  duration  of  the  mission.  therefore,  devices  and  sensors  need  to  be  powerefficient,  and  endusers  have  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy use  them  appropriately.  likewise,  it  is  not  easy  to  recharge  iot  devices  periodically  or  swap  out  batteries  in  deployed  devices.  even  in  the  case  of  bodyworn  devices,  it  is  impractical  to  expect  soldiers  to  carry  additional  batteries  on  top  of  their  current  equipment.  the  exploitation  of  emerging  embedded  hardware  within  the  military,  probably  through  specialized  software  components  designed  to  run  on  those  innovative  platforms,  could  lead  to  a  significant  increase  in  processing  power  and  a  decrease  in  energy  consumption.  furthermore,  design  values  e.g.,  power  cell  size  or  transmission  capabilities  and  equipment  should  fulfill  the  requirements  imposed  and  be  compliant  with
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  considerations  from  military  standards  e.g.,  milstd  810g,  milstd  461f,  milstd1275.  iot  devices  should  be  ruggedized  and  prepared  to  operate  under  extreme  environmental  conditions.  nevertheless,  a  nonnegligible  share  of  devices  is  already  designed  for  harsh  industrial  environments,  and,  thus,  they  would  be  relatively  well  suited  for  the  adoption  in  defense  environments.  one  of  the  largest  gaps  in  the  defense  and  public  safety  data  ecosystem  is  digital  analytics  data  collection,  transformation,  evaluation  and  sharing.  much  of  the  massive  information  collected  by  sensors  is  never  used,  and,  as  for  the  information  that  is  used,  it  often  depends  on  manual  entry  and  processing,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy which  incur  in  significant  delays  when  getting  important  information  in  missioncritical  scenarios.  those  delays  can  cause  missions  fail  or  stall,  or  force  decisionmaking  without  relevant  facts.  for  example,  ustransmcom  bulk  supplies  are  tracked  between  major  hubs  using  rfid  tags,  but  when  supplies  are  broken  down  and  distributed  beyond  the  central  hubs,  they  are  replaced  manually.  officers  in  the  field  sign  for  orders  on  paper  and  enter  serial  numbers  into  computers  by  hand.  this  approach  is  burdensome  and  poses  risks  due  to  human  errors.  much  of  the  value  of  iot  is  generated  by  automation,  allowing  systems  to  react  quicker  and  with
__label__controloptimizationautonomy more  precision  than  humans.  few  military  systems  include  fully  autonomous  responses.  for  example,  most  unmanned  systems  deployed  are  not  autonomous  but  remotely  controlled  by  operators.  this  management  effort  needs  the  development  of  new  lightweight  management  protocols.  for  example,  monitoring  the  m2m  communications  of  iot  objects  is  important  to  ensure  constant  connectivity.  lightweightm2m  is  a  standard  developed  by  the  open  mobile  alliance  oma  to  interface  between  m2m  devices  and  servers  to  build  an  applicationagnostic  scheme  for  the  remote  management  of  a  variety  of  devices.  the  netconf  light  protocol  is  an  internet  engineering  task  force  ietf  effort  for  the  management  of  resourceconstrained

__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  connectivity  of  sensors  improves,  the  system  can  become  overwhelmed  with  the  huge  volume  of  data  in  transit.  this  increase  in  volume  of  data  may  force  an  upgrade  to  a  systems  network  infrastructure  to  increase  bandwidth  or,  alternatively,  it  may  require  to  increase  the  performance  of  intelligent  data  filtering.  in  the  commercial  environment,  network  bandwidth  and  qos  quality  of  service  challenges  are  addressed  using  cots  hardware  combined  with  open  virtualization  platforms  to  manage  network  demands  dynamically.  these  advanced  network  servers  provide  both  high  availability  and  also  new  approaches  to  control  and  provision  network  systems  by  delivering  a  path  to  network

__label__controloptimizationautonomy infrastructure,  both  for  connectivity  and  for  the  backoffice  systems.  transitioning  to  a  combat  cloud  infrastructure  will  offer  greater  ability  to  export  both  assets  and  data  in  the  field  for  joint  operations.  also  a  combat  cloud  will  allow  information  and  control  to  move  forward  when  appropriate,  providing  the  operational  flexibility  to  deal  with  coalitions.  nowadays,  any  army  in  the  world  can  have  the  network  infrastructure  needed  to  handle,  process  and  distribute  the  massive  flow  of  data  that  would  be  generated  by  a  widespread  iot  .  in  order  to  make  effective  use  of  iot,  the  devices  must  be  able  to  connect  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy global  networks  to  transmit  sensor  data  and  receive  actionable  analytics.  mobile  adhoc  networks  manet  ,  and  hybrid  wireless  sensor  networks  wsns  ,  are  the  main  tactical  topologies.the  authors  of  evaluate  the  performance  of  network  coding  in  the  context  of  multihop  military  wireless  networks.  the  researchers  prove  its  efficiency  in  multicast  and  broadcast  communications.  they  also  test  the  optimal  capacity  of  the  system  and  its  ability  to  recover  from  lost  packets.  network  coding  operates  well  even  with  highly  lossy  and  unreliable  links.  interest  has  grown  in  opportunistic  sensing  systems  ,  particularly  on  those  that  take  advantage  of  smartphoneembedded  sensors  .  a
__label__controloptimizationautonomy network  of  opportunistic  sensing  systems  can  automatically  discover  and  select  sensor  platforms  based  on  the  operational  scenario,  detecting  the  appropriate  set  of  features  and  optimal  means  for  data  collection,  obtaining  missing  information  by  querying  resources  available,  and  using  appropriate  methods  to  fuse  data.  thus,  the  system  results  in  an  adaptive  network  that  automatically  finds  scenariodependent  objectivedriven  opportunities  with  optimized  performance.  for  example,  missiondriven  tasking  of  information  producers  mtip  ,  is  a  prototype  system  for  sharing  of  airborne  sensors  that  focuses  on  the  effective  allocation  of  a  large  number  of  potentially  competing  individual  tasks  to  individual  sensors.  nevertheless,  specific  protocols  are
__label__controloptimizationautonomy needed  for  advancing  autonomous  sensing  that  not  only  ensures  effective  utilization  of  sensing  assets  but  also  provides  robust  optimal  performance  .  moreover,  the  development  of  a  decentralized  infrastructure  is  needed  to  avoid  a  single  point  of  failure.  bandwidth  is  perhaps  one  of  the  most  precious  resources  in  a  tactical  environment.  it  is  expected  that  in  dynamic  battlefield  environments  largescale  data  analysis  will  be  conducted  in  near  realtime.  this  fact  implies  constraints  on  data  analysis  coupled  with  connectivity  challenges.  decentralizing  computational  resources  by  creating  multiple  and  local  cloudlets  is  insufficient  if  the  overall  approach  still  consists  in  sending  raw  data  from
__label__controloptimizationautonomy transducers  to  a  local  cloud  for  processing.  mobility  is  another  challenge  for  the  iot  implementations  because  most  of  the  services  are  expected  to  be  delivered  to  users  on  the  move.  service  interruption  can  occur  when  the  devices  transfer  data  from  one  gateway  to  another.  to  support  service  continuity,  ganz  et  al.  propose  a  resource  mobility  scheme  that  supports  two  modes:  caching  and  tunneling.  these  methods  allow  applications  to  access  iot  data  when  resources  become  temporarily  unavailable.  the  evaluation  results  show  a  reduction  of  service  loss  in  mobility  scenarios  of  30.  the  huge  number  of  smart  devices  in  iot  systems  also

__label__controloptimizationautonomy to  be  addressed  at  every  level  of  iot,  from  the  high  volume  of  endpoint  devices  that  gather  data  and  execute  tasks,  to  cloudbased  control  systems  through  network  infrastructure  .  several  protection  mechanisms  and  electronic  protection  measures  epm  features  have  been  identified  within  transec  such  as  low  probability  of  interception  lpi  e.g.,  secure  pnsequence  generators  to  prevent  easy  sequence  estimation,  scrambling  of  transmission  data  and  control  information,  low  probability  of  detection  lpd  e.g.,  frequency  hopping  and  spreadspectrum  techniques  and  antijamming  aj,  infosec  e.g.,  nato  level  3  security  including  ip  security  protocols  ipsec/haipe  as  well  as  ip  tunneling  protocols,  comsec  and  netsec
__label__controloptimizationautonomy capabilities.  privacy  issues  and  profile  access  operations  between  iot  devices  without  interference  are  critical.  iot  nodes  require  a  variety  of  widelyused  and  wellestablished  security  mechanisms  e.g.,  ssl,  ipsec,  pki  that  perform  numerous  computationally  intensive  cryptographic  operations  .  the  use  of  smaller  cryptographic  key  sizes  is  examined  in  .  sensitive  data  needs  a  transparent  and  easy  access  control  management.  several  proposals  can  be  used,  such  as  grouping  devices,  or  present  only  the  desired  devices  within  each  virtual  network.  another  approach  is  to  support  access  control  in  the  application  layer  on  a  pervendor  basis.  relevant  projects  that  estimate  the  network  location  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy objects  to  perform  contextaware  services  are  reviewed  in  .  current  methods  for  location  estimation  are  based  on  ip.  however,  named  data  networking  ndn  is  one  of  the  candidates  for  naming  infrastructure  in  the  future  internet  .  military  equipment  can  be  subject  to  either  interference,  sabotage,  potential  manipulation  or  disruption  of  data  flows  between  different  units,  resulting  either  in  service  interruptions,  intrusions,  propagation  of  misinformation,  or  misleading  the  cop  on  the  needs  of  support  units.  these  failures  in  equipment  can  compromise  both  intelligent  gathering  and  planned  operations  having  obvious  mission  and  lifethreatening  consequences.  for  example,  inadequately  secured  networks  can  provide  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy enemy  with  intelligence  location,  deployment,  allowing  the  adversary  to  anticipate  movements  of  forces.  furthermore,  security  vulnerabilities  could  allow  enemies  to  take  control  or  disable  automated  systems,  preventing  workforce  from  carrying  out  their  mission,  or  even  using  their  own  assets  against  them.  next,  we  describe  the  main  security  challenges:  device  and  network  security:  the  potential  of  iot  is  derived  to  a  large  extent  from  the  ubiquity  of  devices  and  applications,  and  the  connections  between  them.  this  myriad  of  links  creates  a  massive  number  of  potential  entry  points  for  cyberattackers.  the  systems  also  depend  on  backbone  storage  and  processing  functions,  which  can

__label__controloptimizationautonomy time  and  energy  of  the  device.  next,  we  provide  a  brief  description  on  the  functionality  of  the  most  common  layers.  perception  layer:  this  first  layer  represents  the  physical  elements  aimed  at  collecting  and  processing  information.  most  cots  iot  devices  are  designed  for  benign  environments  and  currently  focus  on  home  automation,  personal  services  and  multimedia  content  delivery.  miniaturized  devices  such  as  transducers  sensors  and  actuators,  smartphones,  system  on  chips  socs  and  embedded  computers  are  getting  more  powerful  and  energy  efficient.  the  next  generation  of  processors  includes  new  hardware  features  aimed  at  providing  highly  trusted  computing  platforms.  for  example,  intel  includes  an
__label__controloptimizationautonomy implementation  of  the  trusted  platform  module  tpm  designed  to  secure  hardware  through  cryptography.  technologies  such  as  arm  trustzone,  freescale  trust  architecture,  and  intel  trusted  execution  enable  the  integration  of  both  software  and  hardware  security  features  .  plugandplay  mechanisms  are  needed  by  this  layer  to  configure  heterogeneous  networks.  big  data  processes  are  initiated  at  this  perception  layer.  this  layer  transfers  data  to  the  object  abstraction  layer  through  secure  channels.  object  abstraction  layer:  it  transfers  data  to  the  service  management  layer  through  secure  channels.  to  transfer  the  data,  the  protocols  used  in  the  cots  iot  nodes  either  use  existing  wireless  standards,  or

__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  control  mechanisms  for  accessing  data  in  the  applications  layer  are  also  handled  by  this  layer.  it  builds  a  business  model  based  on  the  data  received  from  the  application  layer.  moreover,  this  layer  monitors  and  manages  the  underlying  four  layers,  comparing  the  output  of  each  one  with  the  output  expected  to  enhance  services  and  maintain  users  privacy  .  this  layer  is  hosted  on  powerful  devices  due  to  its  complexity  and  computational  needs.  a  generic  iot  architecture  is  presented  in  .  it  introduces  an  iot  daemon  consisting  in  three  layers  with  automation,  intelligence  and  zeroconfiguration:  virtual  object,  composite  virtual  object,  and

__label__controloptimizationautonomy standards,  also  called  military  standards  milstd,  are  used  to  help  achieve  standardization  objectives.  these  documents  are  also  used  by  other  nondefense  government  organizations,  technical  organizations,  and  industry.  the  assist  database  gathers  these  documents  and  also  includes  international  standardization  agreements,  such  as  nato  standards,  ratified  by  the  united  states  and  international  test  operating  procedures.  furthermore,  the  dod  is  starting  to  use  civilian  standards,  since  numerous  contributions  to  the  deployment  and  standardization  of  the  iot  paradigm  come  from  the  scientific  community.  among  them,  the  most  relevant  are  the  ones  provided  by  the  european  commission  and  the  european  standards  organisations  i.e.,  etsi,  cen,

__label__controloptimizationautonomy particular,  4g  lte  uses  carrier  aggregation  up  to  100  mhz,  downlink  and  uplink  spatial  multiplexing,  multipath  propagation  and  heterogeneous  networks  to  provide  higher  throughput,  greater  bandwidth  and  efficiency,  and  facilitate  simultaneous  connection.  highly  integrated  chipsets  exist  for  most  of  these  protocols,  allowing  for  easy  hardware  integration.  the  protocols  mentioned  have  supporting  development  environments  and  in  some  cases  manufacturers  offer  open  source  apis.  the  protocols  presented  offer  at  least  some  form  of  rudimentary  congestion  control,  error  recovery  and  some  adhoc  capability.  none  of  the  communication  protocols  are  designed  for  an  actively  hostile  environment.  another  specific  technologies  in  use  are  rfid,  near
__label__controloptimizationautonomy field  communication  nfc  and  uwb.  this  subsection  briefly  addresses  two  main  concerns:  network  routing  and  identification,  and  rfid  identification  protocols.  regarding  routing  protocols,  routing  protocol  for  low  power  and  lossy  networks  rpl  is  an  ietf  routing  protocol  based  on  ipv6  created  to  support  minimal  routing  requirements  through  a  robust  topology  pointtopoint  ptp,  pmp.  on  the  other  hand,  the  unique  addresses  follow  two  standards  today,  ubiquitous  id  and  epc  global.  the  epc  electronic  product  code  is  a  unique  identification  number  stored  on  an  rfid  tag  that  is  used  basically  in  the  supply  chain  management  to  identify  items.  in  order  to  decrease
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  number  of  collisions  in  the  epc  gen2  protocol,  and  to  improve  tag  identification  procedure,  researchers  have  proposed  to  use  code  division  multiple  access  cdma  instead  of  the  dynamic  framed  slotted  aloha.  a  performance  analysis  of  the  rfid  protocols  in  terms  of  the  average  number  of  queries  and  the  total  number  of  transmitted  bits  required  to  identify  all  tags  in  the  system  can  be  seen  in  .  the  expected  number  of  queries  for  tag  identification  using  the  cdma  technique  is  lower  that  of  the  epc  gen2  protocol,  because  cdma  decreases  the  number  of  collisions.  however,  when  comparing  the  number  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy transmitted  bits  and  the  time  to  identify  all  tags  in  the  system,  epc  gen2  protocol  performs  better.  the  epc  global  architectural  framework  is  based  on  the  epc  information  service,  which  is  provided  by  the  manufacturer,  and  the  ons  object  naming  service  that  offers  features  similar  to  dns  domain  name  service.  being  a  central  lookup  service,  the  root  of  the  ons  can  be  controlled  or  blocked  by  a  company/country,  unlike  the  dns  system.  identification  methods,  such  as  ubiquitous  codes  ucode  and  electronic  product  codes  epc,  are  not  globally  unique,  although  they  provide  a  clear  identity  for  each  object  within  the  network.
__label__controloptimizationautonomy addressing  methods  of  iot  objects,  that  include  ipv4/ipv6,  assist  to  uniquely  identify  objects.  the  growth  of  smart  phone  use  in  the  last  years  has  provided  the  basis  for  iot  hardware  platforms.  this  tendency  derives  into  new  products  being  presented  to  the  market  at  a  fast  pace.  socs  with  very  low  power  consumption,  small  form  factor  and  oriented  at  supporting  wireless  communication  technologies  such  as  wifi  and  ble,  are  being  developed  and  enhanced.  arduino,  raspberry  pi,  udoo,  friendlyarm,  intel  galileo,  gadgetter,  esp8266,  beaglebone,  cubieboard,  zolertia  z1,  wisense,  mulle,  and  tmote  sky  are  just  some  examples  of  popular  hardware  platforms.  most  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy such  devices  are  built  on  top  of  hardware  solutions  based  on  arm  cortex  m  microcontrollers  or  arm  cortex  a  microprocessors,  but  some  use  their  own  socs.  all  these  hardware  platforms  can  be  divided  into  two  groups.  on  the  one  hand,  there  are  sbcs  singleboard  computers  like  raspberry  pi  and  intel  galileo,  which  are  powerful,  and  usually  run  some  kind  of  modified  linux  distribution.  they  support  a  vast  set  of  security  and  communication  alternatives,  but  their  power  consumption  is  high.  on  the  other  hand,  the  second  type  of  platforms  includes  the  motes.  the  esp8266  or  tmote  sky  are  good  examples.  they
__label__controloptimizationautonomy are  much  less  powerhungry,  being  able  to  run  on  standard  batteries  for  extended  periods  of  time.  however,  they  lack  the  processing  capabilities  of  sbcs,  and  run  on  proprietary  or  adhoc  software.  in  addition,  one  of  the  main  problems  of  the  currently  available  commercial  motes  is  their  lack  of  support  for  secure  communication  protocols  and  encryption.  nonetheless,  motes  recently  presented  address  such  an  issue:  for  instance,  the  arduino  mkr1000  includes  hardware  acceleration  for  elliptic  curve  cryptography  ecc,  and  the  esp32  has  support  for  aes256,  sha2,  ecc  and  rsa4096.  regarding  software  platforms,  examples  of  realtime  operating  systems  rtos  are  android,  contiki,  tinyos,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy liteos  or  riot  os.  the  most  common  advanced  programming  environments  and  open  standards  are  arinc  653,  carrier  grade  linux,  eclipse,  face,  and  posix.  it  must  be  also  noted  that  google  and  other  important  technological  companies  partnered  with  the  auto  industry  to  establish  the  open  auto  alliance  oaa  to  bring  additional  features  to  the  android  platform  to  advance  in  the  internet  of  vehicles  paradigm.  connected  devices  need  mechanisms  to  store,  process,  and  retrieve  data  efficiently.  however,  the  amount  of  data  collected  in  an  iot  deployment  may  exceed  the  processing  power  of  regular  hardware  and  software  tools.  moreover,  iot  applications  have  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy able  to  detect  patterns  or  anomalies  in  the  data  when  processing  large  amounts  of  data.  the  emerging  and  developing  technology  of  cloud  computing  is  defined  by  the  u.s.  national  institute  of  standards  and  technology  nist  as  an  access  model  to  an  ondemand  network  of  shared  configurable  computing  sources.  cloud  computing  enables  researchers  to  use  and  maintain  many  resources  remotely,  reliably  and  at  a  low  cost.  the  storage  and  computing  resources  of  the  cloud  present  the  best  choice  for  the  iot  to  store  and  process  large  amounts  of  data.  there  are  some  platforms  for  big  data  analytics  like  apache  hadoop  and

__label__controloptimizationautonomy devices  around  us  offer  computing  capabilities  that  can  be  used  to  perform  parallel  iot  data  analytic  tasks.  instead  of  providing  applications  specific  analytics,  iot  needs  a  common  big  data  analytic  platform  which  can  be  delivered  as  a  service  to  iot  applications.  such  an  analytic  service  should  not  impose  a  considerable  overhead  on  the  overall  iot  ecosystem.  the  three  most  popular  cloud  paradigms  are  infrastructure  as  a  service  iaas,  platform  as  a  service  paas,  and  software  as  a  service  saas.  their  structure  and  corresponding  security  risks  are  represented  in  .  cloud  paradigms:  security  inheritance  and  risks.  a  scalable  analytic  service  for
__label__controloptimizationautonomy time  series  data,  time  series  analytics  as  a  service  tsaaas  is  presented  in  .  pattern  searching  in  tsaaas  can  support  effective  searching  on  large  amounts  of  time  series  data  with  very  little  overhead  on  the  iot  system.  tsaaas  is  implemented  as  an  extension  to  the  time  series  database  service  and  it  is  accessible  by  restful  web  interfaces.  pattern  searches  are  10100  times  faster  than  other  existing  techniques,  and  the  additional  storage  cost  for  the  service  provider  accounts  for  only  about  0.4  of  the  original  time  series  data.  other  feasible  solution  for  iot  big  data  is  to  just  keep  track  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  interesting  data.  existing  approaches  include  principle  component  analysis  pca,  pattern  reduction,  feature  selection,  dimensionality  reduction,  and  distributed  computing  methods  .  iot  can  use  numerous  cloud  platforms  with  different  capabilities  and  strengths  such  as  google  cloud,  aws  ,  ,  bluemix  iot  solutions  ,  geni,  thingworx,  openiot,  arkessa,  axeda,  etherios,  littlebits  besides  ps  providers  such  as  avaya,  huawei  enterprise,  west,  or  microsoft.  for  example,  xively  provides  an  open  source  paas  solution  for  iot  application  developers  and  service  providers.  it  aims  to  securely  connect  devices  to  applications  in  realtime,  it  exposes  accessible  application  programming  interfaces  apis,  and  it  provides  interoperability  with  many
__label__controloptimizationautonomy protocols  and  environments.  it  enables  the  integration  of  devices  with  the  platform  by  libraries  and  facilitates  communication  via  https,  websocket,  or  mqtt.  it  integrates  with  other  platforms  using  python,  java,  and  ruby  libraries;  and  distributes  data  in  numerous  formats  such  as  json,  xml  and  csv  .  it  also  allows  users  to  visualize  their  data  graphically  and  to  remotely  control  sensors  by  modifying  scripts  to  receive  and  send  alerts.  it  is  supported  by  many  original  equipment  manufacturers  oem  like  arexx,  nanode,  opengear,  arduino  or  mbed.  nimbits  connects  smart  embedded  devices  to  the  cloud,  it  performs  data  analytics  and  generates  alerts.  moreover,

__label__controloptimizationautonomy of  accounting  and  billing  of  services,  and,  finally,  support  of  standard  application  protocols.  all  the  platforms  analyzed  by  the  authors  support  sensing  or  actuation  devices,  a  user  interface  to  interact  with  them,  and  a  web  component  to  run  the  business  logic  of  the  application  on  the  cloud.  none  of  such  platforms  supports  the  dds  protocol.  voegler  et  al.  propose  a  novel  infrastructure  to  provide  application  packages  on  resourceconstrained  heterogeneous  edge  devices  elastically  in  largescale  iot  deployments.  it  enables  pushbased  commands  down  to  the  tactical  units  as  well  as  pullbased  from  ground  to  decisionmaking  deployments  supporting  different  topologies  and  infrastructure  requirements.
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  efficient  use  of  cloud  based  resources  requires  the  previous  selection  of  software  architectures  for  both  communications  and  processing.  centralized  cloud  approaches,  in  which  raw  data  is  transmitted  to  the  cloud  for  analysis,  are  nonviable  in  tactical  environments,  as  some  of  the  main  restrictions  in  military  iot  scenarios  are  time  and  resources.  furthermore,  even  if  a  device  has  a  highbandwidth  link  to  a  local  resource,  it  is  not  likely  that  all  devices  will  have  good  connectivity  to  the  same  cloudbased  platform.  thus,  relying  on  tactical  wireless  networks,  any  approach  that  requires  a  centralized  cloud  infrastructure  is  not  likely  to  work
__label__controloptimizationautonomy properly.  moreover,  in  a  centralized  cloud  infrastructure,  processing  represents  a  complex  and  computationally  expensive  procedure,  which  leverages  sophisticated  big  data  tools.  finally,  there  is  a  significant  delay  between  the  time  of  the  iot  data  generation  and  when  the  results  become  available.  in  order  to  address  the  issue  of  distributed  infrastructures  for  iot  data  analysis,  researchers  have  started  investigating  distributed  cloud  architectures.  the  idea  consists  in  extending  and  complementing  a  small  number  of  large  cloud  data  centers  located  in  the  core  of  the  network,  where  most  computational  and  storage  resources  are  concentrated,  with  a  large  number  of  tiny  cloud  data  centers
__label__controloptimizationautonomy located  at  the  boundary  between  the  wired  internet  and  the  iot.  this  would  enable  data  analysis  applications  to  benefit  from  the  elastic  nature  of  cloudbased  resources  while  pushing  the  computation  closer  to  the  iot,  with  obvious  advantages  in  terms  of  reducing  communications  overhead  and  processing  times.  there  is  also  research  to  support  the  processing  of  raw  iot  data  close  to  the  source  of  their  generation,  particularly,  the  processing  and  filtering  of  raw  iot  data  and  the  exploitation  of  iot  specific  computational  solutions  for  data  analysis  purposes.  several  proposals  have  emerged  from  the  realization  that  not  all  the  raw  data  generated
__label__controloptimizationautonomy are  equally  important,  and  that  applications  might  be  better  served  by  focusing  only  on  important  data.  the  quality  of  information  qoi  and  value  of  information  voi  concepts  arise  to  extend  shannons  information  theory  to  consider  both  the  probabilistic  nature  of  the  uncertainties.  these  efforts  are  highly  relevant  for  the  military  iot,  as  the  processing  and  exploitation  of  the  information  is  made  according  to  the  utility  for  its  users.  thus,  the  ability  of  supporting  the  user  in  more  effective  decision  making  has  potential  to  reduce  the  amount  of  computational  and  bandwidth  resources  required  for  data  analysis  and  dissemination.  emerging  hardware  and
__label__controloptimizationautonomy computational  solutions  for  embedded  platforms  require  new  software  architectures  to  fulfill  their  potential.  for  instance,  neuromorphic  processors,  hybrid  cpus/fpgas  processors  feature  programming  models  that  are  different  from  the  ones  of  the  server  cpus  typical  of  cloud  data  centers.  several  research  concepts,  such  as  fog  computing,  cloudlets,  mobile  edge  computing  and  iotcentric  clouds  have  been  recently  proposed  to  complement  the  distributed  cloud  architectures  for  iot  data  analysis  and  security  ,  ,  ,  .  fog  computing  has  the  potential  to  increase  the  overall  performance  of  iot  applications  as  it  tries  to  perform  part  of  high  level  services,  which  are  offered  by  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy cloud,  inside  local  resources.  this  paradigm  is  depicted  in  .  fog  computing  paradigm.  so  far  researchers  have  focused  mostly  on  how  to  extend  elastic  resource  consumption  paradigms  and  big  data  solutions  to  distributed  cloud  configurations,  instead  of  proposing  new  methodologies,  paradigms  and  tools  to  efficiently  exploit  the  capabilities  of  iot  hardware.  fog  computing  can  act  as  a  bridge  between  smart  devices  and  largescale  cloud  computing  and  storage  services.  because  of  their  proximity  to  the  endusers,  it  has  the  potential  to  offer  services  faster.  there  is  a  significant  difference  in  scale  between  the  fog  and  the  cloud:  the  latter  has  massive
__label__controloptimizationautonomy computational,  storage,  and  communications  capabilities  compared  to  the  former.  mobile  network  operators  are  potential  providers  of  fog  computing  since  they  can  offer  fog  services  like  iaas,  paas,  or  saas  at  their  service  network  or  even  at  a  cell  tower,  or  even  a  type  of  transversal  service,  that  is  iot  as  a  service  iotaas.  the  main  advantages  of  fog  computing  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  location:  fog  resources  provide  less  delay  because  they  are  positioned  between  smart  objects  and  the  cloud  datacenters.  distribution:  it  is  possible  to  deploy  many  of  such  micro  centers  close  to  the  endusers  as  their  cost  is
__label__controloptimizationautonomy a  small  fraction  of  a  cloud  datacenter.  scalability:  the  number  of  micro  fog  centers  can  be  increased  to  cope  with  the  increasing  load  and  the  increased  number  of  endusers.  density  of  devices:  fog  helps  to  provide  resilient  and  replicated  services.  mobility  support:  fog  resources  act  as  a  mobile  cloud.  realtime:  it  provides  better  performance  for  realtime  interactive  services.  standardization:  fog  resources  can  interoperate  with  various  cloud  providers.  onthefly  analysis:  fog  resources  can  perform  data  aggregation  to  send  partially  processed  data  as  opposed  to  raw  data  to  the  cloud  data  center  for  further  processing.  one  important  aspect  of  cloud  platforms  is
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  ability  to  interact  with  different  application  protocols.  iotcloud  is  a  project  aimed  at  providing  a  scalable  and  high  performance  cloud  platform  for  iot  applications.  fog  computing  still  needs  research  to  resolve  other  issues  like  reliability,  mobility  and  security  of  analytical  data  on  the  edge  devices.  chang  et  al.  presented  a  fog  computing  model  that  brings  informationcentric  cloud  capabilities  to  the  edge  to  deliver  services  with  reduced  latency  and  bandwidth.  this  situation  calls  for  the  need  of  a  better  horizontal  integration  between  different  application  layer  protocols.  several  attempts  of  integration  have  been  made  in  recent  literature.  for  example,  ponte  offers
__label__controloptimizationautonomy uniform  open  apis  to  enable  the  automatic  conversion  between  various  iot  applications  protocols  such  as  http,  coap,  and  mqtt.  nevertheless,  the  capability  to  perform  anytoany  automatic  protocol  conversion  implies  that  the  underlying  packet  communication  tends  to  be  more  verbose  in  order  to  be  application  agnostic.  furthermore,  ponte,  as  many  other  protocol  gateways,  assumes  the  underlying  devices  to  be  tcp/ip  enabled.  also,  resourceconstrained  devices  are  not  considered  at  all  in  this  solution.  the  kura  project  is  an  m2m  application  platform  that  provides  a  java/osgibased  container  for  applications  running  in  service  gateways.  kura  covers  i/o  access,  data  services,  watchdog,  network  configuration  and
__label__controloptimizationautonomy remote  management.  scada  focuses  on  providing  a  way  to  connect  different  industrial  devices  to  a  common  communication  system.  it  aims  to  ease  postprocess  and  data  visualization.  another  eclipse  iot  project  is  krikkit  that  comes  with  a  restful  api  that  allows  a  developer  to  acquire  data  in  edge  devices  such  as  sensor  gateways.  it  uses  a  publish/subscribe  model  by  which  data  acquiring  rules  or  policies  are  registered  on  edge  devices.  lin  et  al.  use  software  defined  radio  sdr  technology  as  part  of  their  platform  to  sense  and  transform  the  wireless  signals  in  the  frequency  spectrum.  an  approach  based  on  softwaredefined  networking
__label__controloptimizationautonomy sdn  for  iot  tasks  is  presented  in  .  they  develop  a  middleware  with  a  layered  sdn  controller  to  manage  dynamic  and  heterogeneous  multinetwork  environments.  therefore,  a  new  intelligent  iot  gateway  is  needed.  an  intelligent  ruledbased  gateway  should  allow  programmers  to  control  the  wire  protocol  traffic  to  optimize  performance  based  on  the  specific  needs  of  the  given  application  .  the  rules  that  pertain  to  autonomic  management  and  data  aggregation  services  can  result  in  the  generation  and  transmission  of  new  data  and  management  packets  by  the  gateway  itself.  it  will  result  in  a  lighter  protocol  stack  that  relies  on  uip/lwip  with  no
__label__controloptimizationautonomy need  for  tcp/udp,  tls  or  other  security  protocols  on  resourceconstrained  devices.  on  resourcerich  devices  that  support  the  tcp/ip  protocol  suite,  iot  applications  are  implemented  on  top  of  a  variety  of  application  level  protocols  and  frameworks  including  rest,  coap,  mqtt,  and  amqp,  among  others.  on  the  other  hand,  devices  that  do  not  have  the  resources  required  to  support  tcp/ip  have  a  myriad  of  interoperability  issues  that  limit  the  potential  applications  of  the  iot.  the  fulfillment  of  complex  requirements  such  as  ubiquity,  scalability  and  highperformance  lead  to  a  convergence  between  the  iot  and  cloud  through  federation  and  multicloud  architectures.  cloud  federation  is
__label__controloptimizationautonomy one  of  the  core  concepts  for  the  design,  the  deployment  and  the  management  of  decentralized  edge  cloud  infrastructures.  since  federated  systems  inherit  all  of  the  fundamental  aspects  of  distributed  computing,  they  can  certainly  leverage  many  existing  standards  that  have  been  developed  in  this  arena  over  the  past  years.  the  nearfuture  evolution  of  iot  clouds  is  discussed  in  .  there  the  authors  describe  a  threestage  evolution  towards  the  creation  of  an  iot  federation.  the  first  of  such  stages  is  called  monolithic  and  involves  embedded  devices  that  would  be  connected  to  iot  cloud  systems  to  provide  basic  iotaas  the  services  would  be
__label__controloptimizationautonomy developed  either  with  standalone  pieces  of  software  or  by  means  of  container  virtualization  technology.  the  next  stage  is  named  vertical  supply  chain.  in  such  a  stage  the  iot  cloud  providers  leverage  iotaas  offered  by  other  providers.  finally,  the  third  stage  corresponds  to  the  real  iot  cloud  federation,  where  iot  cloud  providers  will  federate  to  extend  their  sensing  capabilities,  adopting  the  container  virtualization  technology  massively  in  order  to  create  more  flexible  iotaas.  likewise,  numerous  research  projects  and  initiatives  ,  are  focused  on  the  realization  of  innovative  architectures  for  the  cloudiot,  enabling  features  such  as  autonomous  service  provisioning  and  management.  indicatively,  such
__label__controloptimizationautonomy a  concept  may  be  applicable  to  5g  technological  solutions  ,  such  as  sdn.  for  example,  cloudbased  mechanisms  will  enable  the  incorporation  of  resources  and  services  independent  of  their  location  across  distributed  computing  and  data  storage  infrastructures.  the  challenge  will  be  the  integration  of  these  different  standardized  capabilities  into  a  coherent  endtoend  federation  model.  according  to  the  cloud  federations  organization,  access  and  scale,  six  federation  deployment  models  can  be  identified  :  simple  pairwise  federation,  hierarchical  federation,  peertopeer  federations,  brokers  or  interclouds.  the  main  challenges  of  employing  cloud  computing  for  the  missioncritical  iot  include  the  synchronization  to  provide  realtime  services  since  they
__label__controloptimizationautonomy are  built  on  top  of  various  cloud  platforms;  the  need  for  a  balance  between  cloud  service  environments  and  iot  requirements,  considering  the  differences  in  infrastructure;  and  to  solve  issues  like  the  lack  of  standardization,  the  complicated  management  and  the  enhancement  of  the  reliability  and  the  security.  hashizume  et  al.  provide  an  analysis  of  vulnerabilities,  threats  and  countermeasures  in  the  cloud  considering  the  three  service  delivery  models:  saas,  paas  and  iaas.  the  article  ends  emphasizing  the  need  for  new  security  techniques  such  as  firewalls,  intrusion  detection  system  ids,  intrusion  prevention  system  ips  and  data  protection  as  well  as  the  redesign  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy traditional  cloud  solutions.  there  are  two  main  security  challenges  in  the  cloudcentric  iot:  secure  storage  and  authorized  data  sharing  in  near  real  time.  authentication  prevents  access  by  illegitimate  users  or  devices,  and  it  can  prevent  legitimate  devices  from  accessing  resources  in  an  unauthorized  way.  scalable  authentication  schemes  have  been  widely  studied  for  traditional  computer  networks  as  well  as  wsns.  cloudcentric  authentication  as  a  service  has  also  been  considered  to  minimize  task  overhead  on  user  devices.  for  example,  butun  et  al.  present  a  hierarchical  authentication  as  a  service  for  ps  networks.  the  proposed  lightweight  cloudcentric  multilevel  framework  addresses  scalability  for  iotworn
__label__controloptimizationautonomy devices.  in  the  proposed  cmula  scheme,  public  safety  responders  and  devices  are  authenticated  through  the  cloud  service  provider  csp.  this  approach  enables  easier  mobility  management.  the  network  consists  of  four  entities:  users  the  chief  officers  who  are  registered  in  the  emergency  system  and  are  responsible  for  managing  the  responders  on  site,  wearable  nodes,  a  wearable  network  coordinator  wnc  responsible  for  managing  all  sensors  attached  to  the  responders  body,  and  a  csp  that  serves  as  certification  authority  for  the  iotbased  public  safety  network.  it  considers  a  public  key  infrastructure  pki  issuing  ecc  throughout  the  cloudcentric  iot.  elliptic  curve  digital  signature  algorithm
__label__controloptimizationautonomy ecdsa,  a  variant  of  ecc,  is  used  for  digital  certificate  generation  and  verification.  another  variant  of  ecc,  the  elliptic  curve  diffiehellman  ecdh  key  exchange  algorithm  is  used  to  exchange  the  secret  message  authentication  code  mac  keys  in  the  initialization  phase.  once  a  user  is  authenticated  to  a  csp,  wearable  devices  can  be  accessed  through  a  wnc.  other  existing  studies  on  cloud  security  have  been  focused  on  issues  concerning  cloud  security,  identity  management,  and  access  control  or  architecture  layers.  for  example,  li  et  al.  review  mechanisms  and  open  issues  for  mobilityaugmented  service  provisioning.  as  a  result,  they  discover  open  challenges  with
__label__controloptimizationautonomy respect  to  overhead,  heterogeneity,  qos,  privacy  and  security.  authors  in  provide  an  integrated  solution  to  cloud  security  based  on  the  socalled  cloud  computing  adoption  framework  ccaf  framework.  it  protects  data  security  and  predicts  the  probable  consequences  of  abnormal  situations  by  using  business  process  modeling  notation  bpmn  simulations.  the  multilayer  description  of  ccaf  is  as  follows.  the  first  layer  is  for  access  control:  a  firewall  allows  the  access  just  to  certain  members.  the  second  layer  consists  of  the  ids/ips  to  provide  uptodate  technologies  to  prevent  attacks  such  as  dos,  antispoofing,  port  scanning,  patternbased  attacks,  parameter  tampering,  cross  site  scripting,  sql  injection

__label__controloptimizationautonomy significant  challenge.  armoured  combat  vehicles  with  welltrained  crews  can  travel  crosscountry  at  blistering  speeds  and  selfdriving  vehicles  can  only  be  relevant  in  combat  scenarios  if  they  can  keep  up  and  fight  with  humans  at  the  objective.  initial  iterations  of  these  vehicles  will  likely  be  remotecontrolled  similar  to  how  predator  drones  still  have  a  human  crew  rather  than  being  fully  autonomous.  this  throws  up  yet  even  more  technical  challenges,  not  least  when  it  comes  to  command  links  and  ensuring  that  they  are  properly  encrypted  to  ensure  that  enemy  forces  do  not  jam,  or  even  hijack,  robotic  vehicles.  the  increasing  congestion  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  electromagnetic  spectrum  as  more  unmanned  systems  are  introduced  is  also  a  hurdle  to  overcome,  as  armed  forces  have  to  ensure  that  the  spectrum  is  managed  correctly  to  avoid  system  outages.  these  challenges  mean  that  the  introduction  of  a  robotic  combat  vehicle  that  can  fight  alongside  tanks  in  combat  could  still  be  some  way  off.  instead,  the  militarys  adoption  of  robotic  vehicles  will  likely  mirror  the  commercial  world,  with  newgeneration  armoured  vehicles  incorporating  more  computing  power,  sensing  technologies  and  drivebywire  functionality  to  automate  processes  such  as  convoy  operations.  so  while  there  has  been  considerable  progress  from  darpas  original  grand  challenge,

__label__controloptimizationautonomy looking  to  expand  its  applications.  but  this  new  technology  brings  with  it  organizational  and  security  challenges  that  present  both  opportunities  and  obstacles.  the  turbulent  seas  of  the  north  atlantic  in  1941  are  a  surprising  place  to  find  an  explanation  for  the  militarys  need  of  the  internet  of  things.  but  in  that  pitched  battle  between  allied  merchant  ships  and  german  uboats,  information  was  the  key  to  victory.  codebreaking  and  aircraft  from  escort  carriers  were  the  sensors,  feeding  information  into  centralized  command  centers,  where  decision  makers  on  both  sides  routed  submarine  wolf  packs  or  rerouted  convoys  of  merchantmen.  victory  went  to  those

__label__controloptimizationautonomy importance  and  impact  is  so  great  that  it  is  classified  in  the  same  category  as  artilleryas  a  deadly  longrange  weapon.  with  information  so  central  to  all  activities,  the  military  is  naturally  hungry  for  technology  or  tools  that  improve  communication,  routing,  or  processing  of  information.  the  internet  of  things  iot  is  one  such  technology.  whether  called  the  internet  of  everything,  machinetomachine,  or  ubiquitous  or  embedded  or  ambient  computing,  the  iot  is  fundamentally  about  connecting  disparate  objects  into  larger  networks.  while  the  military  has  been  a  driver  in  connected  and  machinetomachine  communications  such  as  radio  frequency  identification,  more  commonly  known  as  rfid,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy it  has  been  slow  to  adopt  true  iot  applications  that  knit  these  communications  into  interoperable,  automated  cycles.  communications  remain  within  their  given  channels,  not  easily  shared  or  aggregated.  the  challenge  is  that  defense  leaders  wishing  to  take  advantage  of  the  iot  face  a  complex  technological  and  regulatory  landscape  that  threatens  to  mire  their  efforts  in  endless  choices  and  challenges.  this  article  aims  to  help  leaders  navigate  complex  iot  decisions  by  pointing  out  which  applications  may  be  better  suited  for  their  goals  related  to  cost  efficiency  and/or  warfighter  effectiveness.  in  each  case,  we  will  use  deloittes  information  value  loop  as  an
__label__controloptimizationautonomy analytical  framework  to  identify  the  key  investments  necessary  to  realize  the  iots  potential  benefits.  the  suite  of  technologies  that  enables  the  internet  of  things  promises  to  turn  most  any  object  into  a  source  of  information  about  that  object.  this  creates  both  a  new  way  to  differentiate  products  and  services  and  a  new  source  of  value  that  can  be  managed  in  its  own  right.  realizing  the  iots  full  potential  motivates  a  framework  that  captures  the  series  and  sequence  of  activities  by  which  organizations  create  value  from  information:  the  information  value  loop.  for  information  to  complete  the  loop  and  create  value,  it

__label__controloptimizationautonomy with  those  atop  any  organization,  use  structure  in  order  to  understand  the  choices  before  them.  the  value  loop  see  sidebar  is  exactly  one  such  structure,  providing  the  context  to  sort  through  all  of  the  noise  and  determine  where  to  apply  the  next  investment  dollar  to  bring  value  to  the  organization.  militaryoriented  readers  can  recognize  the  foundation  of  the  value  loop  as  a  decision  cycle,  with  stages  that  echo  observeorientdecideact.  what  is  unique  to  the  loop  is  its  ability  to  simplify  iot  decision  making.  the  value  loop  is  able  to  bring  order  to  the  menagerie  of  iot  technologies  by  showing  how

__label__controloptimizationautonomy of  sequestration  and  the  global  war  on  terror,  the  overarching  theme  commonly  seen  in  defense  budgets  is  seeking  a  balanced  force.  the  united  states  needs  a  flexible  force  with  more  combat  power  than  ever  to  counter  diverse  threats  from  syria  to  the  south  china  sea,  but  also  one  that  is  costeffective  and  efficient  in  its  use  of  resources.  to  meet  the  challenge,  commanders  naturally  seek  options  that  will  either  reduce  costs,  freeing  up  time  and  assets  for  core  mission  activities,  or  directly  improve  those  activities  themselves.  we  can  categorize  iot  applications  according  to  the  same  logic:  those  that  aim  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy improve  cost  efficiency,  those  that  aim  to  improve  warfighter  effectiveness,  and  rare  cases  that  aim  for  both.  while  some  aspects  of  the  military  are  decidedly  unique,  other  functions  closely  mirror  their  civilian  counterparts.  in  these  areas,  such  as  asset  tracking  and  facilities  management,  leaders  can  simply  import  existing  civilian  technologies  to  gain  the  advantages  of  new  iot  applications.  cost  reductions  through  asset  tracking:  many  individuals  with  even  loose  military  associations  have  experienced  the  tedium  of  filling  out  handwritten  receipts.  and  all  too  many  leaders  know  the  more  intense  pain  of  long  hours  spent  inventorying  equipment  by  hand,  reading  off  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy serial  number  of  each  piece  in  turn.  more  than  a  mere  inconvenience,  these  dated  assetmanagement  practices  compromise  the  us  department  of  defenses  dods  overall  supplychain  effectiveness.  a  recent  survey  of  dod  supply  logistics  managers  identified  ineffective  data  management  as  the  primary  risk  to  their  supply  chains.  this  lack  of  information  directly  results  in  equipment  shortages  on  the  one  hand  and  waste  of  excess  equipment  on  the  other.  the  dod  recognizes  these  inefficiencies  and  has  long  worked  to  improve  them.  as  far  back  as  2005,  the  defense  logistics  agency  argued  for  the  militarys  adoption  of  rfid  as  a  standard  for  supplychain
__label__controloptimizationautonomy tracking.  the  potential  benefits  seemed  obvious:  better  awareness  of  equipment  location  and  status;  faster,  more  accurate  deliveries  of  needed  supplies;  and,  of  course,  less  manpower  wasted  on  dreaded  inventories.  however,  even  as  an  early  adopter,  the  dod  has  struggled  to  win  widespread  acceptance  for  rfid.  largely  this  is  because  the  department  has  had  difficulty  demonstrating  the  return  on  investment  for  the  subordinate  commanders  who  bear  the  time  and  cost  burden  of  implementing  rfid.  without  a  clear  picture  of  how  they  will  benefit,  leaders  are  reluctant  to  invest  scarce  resources  in  these  technologiesan  important  point  for  iot  applications  in  general.  in
__label__controloptimizationautonomy terms  of  the  value  loop,  this  lack  of  investment  stifles  the  loop  where  it  begins,  at  the  create  phase.  without  putting  sensors  on  objects  and  connecting  them,  data  are  not  created,  and  no  information  flows  around  the  loop.  although  the  initial  costs  may  seem  daunting,  midsize  defense  organizations  such  as  the  robotic  systems  joint  project  office  have  been  able  to  implement  assettracking  systems  for  as  little  as  400,000.  similar  applications  in  the  civilian  sector  have  been  able  to  recoup  their  investment  within  the  first  year.  by  applying  location  sensors  to  moveable  patient  monitors,  seven  hospitals  across  the  nation  were  able
__label__controloptimizationautonomy to  more  efficiently  use  the  monitors.  one  hospital  saved  more  than  500,000  a  year  in  the  cost  of  buying  or  renting  new  monitors.  more  importantly,  when  integrating  sensors  into  a  larger  tracking  system,  hospitals  were  better  able  to  map  the  flow  of  patients,  resulting  in  maximized  bed  use  and  annual  revenue  increases  in  the  millions  of  dollars.  cost  reductions  through  facilities  management:  civilian  iot  successes  in  utilities  and  facilities  management  also  can  provide  a  useful  roadmap  for  the  military,  in  an  area  with  immense  potential  for  value  capture.  the  dod  holds  the  largest  us  portfolio  of  facilities  and  is  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy nations  largest  single  energy  user.  in  fy  2016,  the  department  will  spend  more  than  10  billion  to  maintain  and  repair  those  facilities.  in  an  era  of  tight  budgets,  facilities  maintenance  and  utilities  are  often  easy  targets:  the  marine  corps  alone  was  forced  to  cut  7  million  from  its  utilities  budget  for  2016.  since  turning  off  the  lights  on  the  troops  is  not  a  viable  solution,  improving  energy  efficiency  can  be  key.  an  iot  application  already  proven  in  the  civilian  world  may  offer  promise  for  the  militarys  energyefficiency  goals.  in  the  civilian  world,  the  iot  has  enabled  centralized  buildingmanagement  systems  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy target  costs  by  monitoring  and  coordinating  utilities  and  building  functions.  for  example,  the  central  bucks  school  district  in  pennsylvania  has  saved  15  million  in  energy  costs  in  five  years  by  implementing  an  iotenabled  facilities  management  system.  these  systems  go  beyond  simply  dimming  lights  or  heating  only  occupied  roomsthey  include  continuous  monitoring,  which  identifies  hardtodetect  inefficiencies.  one  application  at  western  kentucky  university  found  unexpectedly  high  energy  usage  in  offpeak  hours  via  leaks  in  the  airhandling  system,  causing  major  waste  and  expense.  as  with  asset  tracking,  the  bottleneck  in  the  information  value  loop  of  facilities  management  starts  with  create:  useful  data  are
__label__controloptimizationautonomy simply  not  being  created.  with  existing,  proven  technology,  defense  leaders  can  more  easily  act  to  see  desired  savings.  a  pilot  study  implementing  iot  solutions  at  great  lakes  naval  station  combined  realworld  weather  data,  energy  consumption,  comfort  thresholds,  and  data  collected  from  buildings  into  a  machinelearning  algorithm  designed  to  reduce  energy  consumption.  the  study  found  reductions  in  energy  usage  of  20  to  30  percent,  suggesting  that,  if  implemented  across  the  dod,  annual  savings  of  500  million  could  be  possible.  challenges  to  adoption:  why  has  the  military  struggled  to  implement  costreducing  iot  applications  that  forprofit  companies  have  used  to  great  effect?  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy challenge  in  implementation  is  not  a  matter  of  technological  lagthe  devices  and  capabilities  are  already  in  use  in  the  private  sector  and  have  demonstrated  effectiveness  in  specific  military  installations.  rather,  slow  iot  adoption  can  be  explained  by  analyzing  the  fundamental  structural  and  cultural  differences  between  the  private  sector  and  the  military.  military  leaders,  in  contrast  to  their  civilian  counterparts,  are  rarely  able  to  keep  any  savings  they  realize  from  implementing  facilities  or  utilities  efficienciesthey  may  even  be  penalized.  the  difficulties  in  moving  funds  between  different  appropriations  means  that  a  commander  who  saves  1  million  in  energy  costs  is  likely  unable
__label__controloptimizationautonomy to  use  that  same  1  million  to  buy  more  equipment  or  hold  more  training  exercises.  instead,  the  money  may  be  lost,  with  commanders  often  suffering  a  reduction  in  the  next  years  budget  as  a  reward  for  their  thrift.  the  possibility  of  misaligned  incentives  suggests  a  need  for  a  centralized  management  approach:  one  organization  that  is  able  to  design,  test,  and  implement  energysaving  measures,  then  mandates  the  successful  efforts  across  one  of  the  five  us  military  services  or  even  across  the  joint  force.  if  that  organization  also  managed  the  facilities  or  utilities  budget  as  a  whole,  it  would  be  able  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy realize  and  allocate  the  savings  created  by  energy  efficiency,  aligning  incentives.  with  the  creation  of  organizations  such  as  the  air  forces  installation  and  mission  support  center,  all  the  services  seem  to  be  on  the  path  toward  centralized  management.  such  organizations  are  well  positioned  to  capitalize  on  demonstrated  civilian  success  in  iot  facilities  management  and  begin  to  reach  the  costreduction  goals  of  the  modern  military.  where  civilian  iot  applications  could  deliver  efficiency  and  cost  reductions  in  supplychain  tracking  and  facilities  management,  the  unique  demands  of  warfighter  support  require  militaryspecific  iot  applications.  consider  julius  caesar  commanding  the  famed  tenth  legion  at  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy battle  of  sabis  in  57  bc.  briefly  surprised  by  the  gauls,  caesar  rode  to  the  front  lines,  observed  his  forces,  and  shouted  orders  to  each  centurion  by  name.  for  centuries,  that  was  the  model  of  command  and  communications:  battlefield  commanders  pulled  information  about  friendly  and  enemy  situations  from  the  dust  of  the  melee  and  then  pushed  commands  and  orders  down  to  the  tactical  units.  for  caesar,  with  all  of  his  forces  easily  seen  and  within  shouting  distance,  this  pushpull  model  was  fairly  straightforward,  but  the  expansion  of  modern  battlefields  has  introduced  new  challenges.  today  the  pull  is  often  accomplished  by
__label__controloptimizationautonomy data  fusion,  trying  to  give  a  commander  the  widest,  most  diverse  picture  of  the  battlefield.  the  push  is  the  challenge  of  operational  communications:  how  to  disseminate  orders  to  and  among  tactical  units.  the  military  has  already  implemented  many  of  the  foundational  components  of  iot  in  both  pull  and  push;  however,  data  often  remain  disconnectedseparate  value  loops  with  separate  flows  of  information.  continued  development  in  network  technology  and  data  standards  promises  to  create  a  tactical  iot  that  can  unify  the  push  and  the  pull,  remaking  battlespace  awareness  into  a  truly  modern  processone  that  caesar  would  not  recognize.  pull  data  fusion:  informed
__label__controloptimizationautonomy decision  making  is  predicated  on  having  comprehensive  knowledge  of  the  battlefield:  reports  from  a  range  of  locations,  taken  over  a  span  of  time  that  paint  an  accurate  picture  of  the  situation.  for  caesar,  this  was  as  simple  as  looking  across  the  field  of  clashing  warriors.  but  battlefields,  and  the  sophistication  of  the  battles  fought  on  them,  have  grown.  the  information  a  commander  needs  to  make  effective  decisions  has  expanded  exponentially,  meaning  that  commanders  often  bring  together  volumes  of  diverse  data  to  understand  their  battlespace.  in  terms  of  deloittes  iot  framework,  they  focus  on  aggregate  .  the  importance  of  data  in
__label__controloptimizationautonomy modern  warfare  poses  two  distinct  challenges  for  a  commander:  handling  the  sheer  volume  of  data  produced,  and  integrating  numerous  types  of  data  into  one  coherent  battlespace  picture.  storing  and  quickly  retrieving  large  volumes  of  data  is  not  a  uniquely  military  taskother  areas  of  government  have  made  substantial  progress  on  this  challenge.  with  an  estimated  220  exabytes  of  data  worldwide  to  be  stored  in  2015,  a  civilianworld  solution  has  been  to  move  data  to  the  cloud.  defense  and  intelligence  leaders  have  followed  suit:  the  cia  and  defense  information  security  agency  disa  have  leaned  on  civilian  expertise,  working  with  commercial  companies  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy bring  the  cloud  and  software  to  secure  government  networks.  thus,  the  infrastructure  for  dealing  with  the  data  volume  of  tactical  iot  applications  is,  potentially,  already  in  place.  diversity  of  data,  on  the  other  hand,  poses  unique  challenges  to  cloud  implementation  in  the  military  and  complicates  privatesector  comparisons.  drones  are  a  particularly  illustrative  example:  the  department  of  defense  has  fielded  at  least  13  different  types  of  unmanned  aerial  systems,  each  with  an  array  of  sensors  producing  multiple  types  of  data.  this  doesnt  begin  to  address  the  issue  of  compatibilityjust  one  of  those  data  types,  video,  can  come  in  more  than  20
__label__controloptimizationautonomy different  file  formats,  with  even  more  choices  of  encoding  and  frame  rates.  youtubea  civilian  site  that  hosts  only  videoscan  support  just  nine  file  formats.  indeed,  military  datafusion  applications  incorporate  not  only  videos  but  still  imagery,  signals  intelligence,  human  intelligence,  ground  sensors,  battlefield  reports,  map  data,  and  a  host  of  other  data  sources.  as  the  value  loop  shows,  aggregating  these  disparate  types  of  data  necessitates  a  common  set  of  data  standards.  with  multiple  agencies,  commands,  and  military  services  involved  in  the  production,  transmission,  and  consumption  of  all  of  these  data  types,  creating  a  common  set  of  standards  will  likely  require  a

__label__controloptimizationautonomy has  not  evolved  into  true  iot  functionality,  with  data  that  are  open  and  discoverable  between  systems.  information  bottlenecks  are  frequent  within  operational  and  intelligence  networks.  the  typical  brigade  combat  team  communications  network  in  2013  featured  5,000  discrete  nodes  communicating  over  more  than  18  distinct  network  types.  where  data  do  cross  between  these  networks,  they  often  do  so  via  an  arduous  manual  process.  the  dream  of  true  iot  capability  in  operational  communications  is  not  new.  as  far  back  as  the  1993  launch  of  the  armys  nowdefunct  land  warrior  program,  the  military  has  tried  to  integrate  frontline  forces  sensors,  weapons  systems,  and
__label__controloptimizationautonomy communications.  until  recently,  the  technology  simply  did  not  exist  to  make  these  systems  work  as  desired:  they  could  not  connect  to  other  systems  such  as  blue  force  tracker,  nor  did  the  communications  systems  have  enough  power  to  transmit  the  volume  of  information  created.  to  put  this  in  terms  of  the  information  value  loop,  there  was  a  bottleneck  at  the  communicate  stage.  where  pull  was  limited  by  the  process  challenge  of  breaking  down  multiple,  siloed  data  standards  i.e.,  failures  in  aggregation  and  the  standards  that  support  them,  iot  usage  in  operational  communications  is  constrained  by  the  technical  limitations  in  mobile  communications
__label__controloptimizationautonomy networks  bandwidth  and  robustness.  while  a  consumers  4g  lte  smartphone  will  routinely  post  download  speeds  in  the  range  of  8  to  9  mbps,  the  militarys  commercial  satellite  network  used  for  mobile  network  access  posts  a  top  speed  of  less  than  0.5  mbps.  these  speeds  are  more  than  enough  if  soldiers  need  only  voice  communication  or  to  send  short  textonly  messages,  but  current  military  communications  systems  cannot  provide  a  soldier  in  the  field  with  the  bandwidth  that  a  true  iot  application  would  requireand  certainly  not  wirelessly.  while  the  military  can,  to  a  certain  extent,  ride  the  wave  of  civilian  mobile  telecommunication
__label__controloptimizationautonomy such  as  4g  lte,  those  advances  will  likely  need  to  be  paired  with  advanced,  militaryspecific  communications  architectures.  after  all,  the  average  consumer  does  not  need  a  network  of  rugged,  encrypted,  frequencyhopping,  multiband  radios.  for  the  military,  though,  research  in  this  area  is  beginning  to  bear  fruit.  for  a  number  of  years,  darpa  has  been  experimenting  with  mobile  ad  hoc  networks,  designed  to  form  a  selfcreating  and  selfhealing  mesh  of  communication  nodes,  with  setup  time  measured  in  minutes  instead  of  days.  darpa  envisions  networks  of  more  than  1,000  nodes  providing  individual  soldiers  with  streaming  video  from  drones  and  other  sensors,  radio
__label__controloptimizationautonomy communications  to  higher  headquarters,  and  advanced  situational  awareness  of  other  soldiers  location  and  status.  some  of  the  products  of  such  research  are  already  reaching  the  battlefield:  the  army  has  begun  testing  prototypes  of  its  integrated  sensor  architecture,  which  allows  for  dynamic  discovery  of  sensors.  using  this  architecture,  for  example,  a  soldier  walking  through  an  area  could  quickly  locate  a  sensor  hidden  in  the  ground  and  read  off  data  about  whether  any  enemy  vehicles  had  passed  through  the  area  over  the  past  24  hours.  without  the  ubiquitous  cellular  signal  upon  which  we  rely  in  our  daily  lives,  these  military  iot  networks
__label__controloptimizationautonomy operate  over  tactical  radios.  the  next  generation  of  highbandwidth  radios  that  could  make  these  integrated  networks  a  reality  are  already  under  development.  air  force  special  operations  command  recently  released  a  contract  solicitation  describing  requirements  for  a  tactical  radio  that  sounds  more  like  a  futuristic  smartphone  than  a  traditional  singlechannel  vhf  radio.  the  special  operations  forces  multifunction  radio  must  be  able  to  form  a  100node  selfhealing  mesh  network  and  automatically  connect  within  five  seconds.  with  a  minimum  5  mbps  data  rate,  it  is  about  as  fast  as  the  4g  lte  smartphone  in  your  pocket,  while  meeting  military  durability  and  encryption  requirements.
__label__controloptimizationautonomy unified  battlespace  awareness:  with  these  advances  in  communications  architecture  and  devices,  a  true  tactical  iot  will  be  nearly  here.  the  high  data  rates  and  flexible  communications  architectures  now  reaching  operating  forces  do  not  simply  improve  upon  existing  communicationsthey  have  the  potential  to  change  how  soldiers  in  the  field  shoot,  move,  and  communicate.  individual  applications  already  allow  a  soldier  to  view  streaming  video  from  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  overhead,  see  nearby  soldiers  ammunition  status,  text  message  a  call  for  fire  to  supporting  artillery,  and  even  allow  headquarters  to  look  through  a  rifle  scope.  the  current  challenge  is  integrating  all  of  those  applications.
__label__controloptimizationautonomy indeed,  all  of  this  is  about  more  than  simply  giving  every  soldier  a  smartphoneit  is  about,  for  the  first  time,  unifying  the  push  and  the  pull  of  commandandcontrol.  where  now  commanders  pull  data  from  the  front  lines  and  push  orders  down,  a  tactical  iot  would  allow  for  organic  flow  of  information  up  and  down  the  chain  and  around  the  value  loop,  with  both  the  commander  in  the  tactical  operations  center  and  the  soldier  on  point  enjoying  increased  situational  awareness.  the  tactical  military  iot  is  the  next  step  in  commandandcontroland  the  first  step  toward  a  new  approach  radically  different  than  caesar
__label__controloptimizationautonomy shouting  to  his  centurions.  we  have  already  seen  how  repurposed  civilian  iot  applications  can  help  the  military  cut  costs,  and  where  militaryspecific  iot  applications  in  battlespace  awareness  can  increase  warfighter  effectiveness,  but  there  is  one  area  where  a  revolution  is  pending  with  the  potential  to  do  both:  autonomic  logistics.  like  the  iot,  autonomic  logistics  goes  by  many  names:  predictive,  proactive,  prognostic,  or  conditionbased  maintenance.  but  in  each  case,  the  concept  revolves  around  the  ability  to  use  realtime  data  about  usage  and  system  performance  to  predict  failures.  also  like  the  iot,  this  concept  is  not  new,  dating  back  to  darpasponsored  research
__label__controloptimizationautonomy in  the  1970s,  but  has  come  into  its  own  only  with  the  inexpensive  computing,  sensor,  and  communication  technology  of  the  past  decade.  meet  alis:  the  most  advanced  example  is  the  autonomic  logistics  information  system  alis,  pronounced  alice  of  the  f35  joint  strike  fighter.  alis  uses  sensors  embedded  throughout  the  aircraft  to  detect  performance,  compare  to  parameters,  use  sophisticated  analytics  to  predict  maintenance  needs,  and  then  communicate  with  maintenance  staff  so  that  the  right  parts  are  ready  when  needed.  this  represents  a  quantum  leap  over  standard  maintenance  practice,  in  which  a  maintainers  only  guide  is  checklists  based  on  how  many  hours
__label__controloptimizationautonomy an  airframe  has  flown.  statistical  experiments  have  demonstrated  improvements  in  both  cost  and  aircraft  availability  over  these  standard  maintenance  methods.  these  improvements  occur  at  every  link  of  the  maintenance  supply  chain:  ordering  the  right  parts  at  the  right  time  means  a  simpler  logistical  train;  less  unnecessary  maintenance  means  fewer  maintenance  personnel  and  lower  costs;  and  with  fewer  aircraft  grounded  for  maintenance,  more  are  available  for  flight,  increasing  potential  combat  sorties.  according  to  william  scheuren,  the  former  head  of  the  darpa  program  that  eventually  brought  forth  the  f35,  the  goal  of  autonomic  logistics  is  to  reduce  the  complexity  of  the  logistical
__label__controloptimizationautonomy train  by  50  percent,  reduce  the  number  of  maintenance  personnel  by  20  to  40  percent,  and  increase  the  number  of  combat  sorties  by  25  percent.  while  logistics  is  everywhere,  like  battlespace  awareness,  alis  is  a  uniquely  military  application.  civilian  manufacturers,  for  example,  can  use  networked  sensors  to  monitor  the  performance  of  engines  mounted  on  commercial  airliners  and  to  suggest  maintenance  to  ground  crews,  but  no  system  monitors  all  aspects  of  a  vehicle,  from  engine  to  avionics,  or  integrates  all  aspects  of  the  supply  chain,  from  the  aircraft  itself  to  maintainers  to  parts  depots.  this  projects  scope  and  scale  are  such
__label__controloptimizationautonomy that  the  military  is  breaking  new  ground  and,  naturally,  uncovering  new  challenges  along  the  way.  one  of  those  new  challenges  implies  that  incorporating  iot  technology  can  be  something  of  a  cautionary  tale.  the  development  of  the  f35  has  seen  numerous  cost  and  schedule  overruns:  already  the  most  expensive  weapon  system  in  history,  the  f35s  sustainment  costs  are  set  to  be  nearly  double  those  of  the  f15c/d,  f16c/d,  av8b,  and  f18ad  combined  .  and  a  large  part  of  that  sustainment  bill  is  due  to  performance  issues  and  cost  overruns  within  the  alis  program.  the  complex  integration  of  hardware  and  software  found
__label__controloptimizationautonomy in  alis  has  created  a  number  of  technical  conflicts  and  glitches;  in  some  cases,  these  faults  have  actually  weakened  the  very  metrics  alis  was  designed  to  improve.  in  one  documented  case,  alis  incorrectly  signaled  that  the  landing  gear  of  an  aircraft  had  failed  when  in  fact  the  fault  was  with  a  small  component  near  the  gear.  this  error  forced  maintainers  to  repeatedly  inspect  the  landing  gear,  forcing  the  grounding  of  an  otherwise  healthy  aircraft.  in  this  case,  the  sensor  worked  properly  in  detecting  a  fault,  but  the  analytical  software  failed  in  understanding  its  importance.  marine  corps  lt.  gen.  robert  schmidle
__label__controloptimizationautonomy hinted  at  the  root  of  the  problem  in  a  recent  interview:  we  need  to  have  the  ability  to  override  the  algorithms  that  are  built  into  that  system  to  determine  whether  an  aircraft  is  safe  to  fly  or  not.  to  put  this  in  terms  of  our  value  loop,  what  gen.  schmidle  and  the  f35  team  are  discovering  is  that  as  the  analytics  or  augmented  intelligence  within  an  iot  application  become  more  complex  and  independent,  new,  previously  unidentified  issues  emergespecifically,  the  boundary  between  humans  and  augmented  intelligence  ai  requires  careful  design.  in  the  case  of  relatively  simple  augmented  intelligencefitness  bands,  for  examplethe
__label__controloptimizationautonomy humanai  boundary  is  relatively  simple  as  well:  it  issues  an  alert  that  the  user  is  free  to  follow  or  ignore.  but  as  ai  grows  in  complexity,  it  cannot  easily  communicate  all  the  parameters  to  a  human  user,  forcing  the  system  to  take  certain  preprogrammed  actions.  however,  if  those  preprogrammed  actions  are  ill  chosen  or  inflexible,  they  can  lead  to  unintended  negative  consequencessuch  as  the  grounding  of  perfectly  good  aircrafts.  in  this  respect,  the  f35  is  on  the  iots  cutting  edge.  previous  deloitte  research  concludes  that  even  the  most  advanced  ai  applications  available  today  still  require  a  human  in  the  loop
__label__controloptimizationautonomy in  order  to  achieve  promised  levels  of  accuracy.  how  exactly  to  combine  human  judgment  and  ai  computational  power  in  the  right  way  remains  a  question  for  each  new  ai  application.  truly  revolutionary  military  iot  applications  of  the  size  and  scope  of  alis  will  continue  to  reveal  challenges  at  the  boundaries  of  our  knowledge  of  cognitive  and  computer  science.  while  the  ultimate  solutions  to  these  issues  likely  lie  in  laboratory  research,  the  military  credo  of  improvise,  adapt,  and  overcome  will  likely  be  the  nearterm  fix.  as  the  marine  corps  prepares  to  declare  initial  operational  capability  of  its  f35  fleet,  simple  fixes
__label__controloptimizationautonomy such  as  a  manual  override  will  likely  serve  as  an  interim  remedy  until  more  robustly  engineered  software  fixes  are  available.  complex  problems  with  simple  interim  solutions  will  likely  form  the  pattern  for  advanced  iot  applications  moving  forward.  with  strategy  concepts  such  as  net  centric,  information  dominance,  and  the  emergence  of  cyber  as  an  entirely  new  domain  of  operations,  information  always  has  and  will  remain  central  to  the  militarys  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  naturally,  iot  technologies  and  architectures  that  are  designed  to  move  and  process  information  more  quickly  and  in  distributed  environments  seem  like  natural  fits  for  military  applications.  but  the  iot
__label__controloptimizationautonomy can  be  a  highly  technical  and  complex  landscape  to  navigate,  and  adapting  applications  for  military  purposes  adds  layers  of  requirements  and  specific  uses.  all  of  this  can  make  it  difficult  for  leaders  to  determine  which  iot  applications  are  right  for  their  organizations  and  how  best  to  implement  them.  our  analysis  has  shown  a  number  of  commonalities  across  different  iot  applications  that  can  help  organizations  move  quickly  toward  technological  transformation.  like  all  planning,  the  first  step  is  to  decide  what  you  need  to  achieve.  in  a  world  where  every  defense  organization  faces  twin  threats  of  budget  cuts  and  dangerous  enemies,  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy first  choice  is  whether  iot  applications  should  aim  to  achieve  cost  reductions,  increase  warfighter  effectiveness,  or  both.  for  the  military  as  in  any  field  or  industry,  there  is  no  onesizefitsall  solution  to  the  iot.  the  key  is  to  take  a  reasoned  approach  to  investigating  iot  applications.  start  from  your  mission  need,  whether  cost  reduction,  warfighter  effectiveness,  or  both,  and  look  forward  from  there.  battlefield  objectives  have  shifted  in  the  centuries  between  caesar  and  the  islamic  statetheres  no  reason  not  to  use  all  available  tools  and  technology  to  achieve  those  objectives.  deloittes  internet  of  things  practice  enables  organizations  to  identify  where

__label__controloptimizationautonomy applications.  there  is  still  a  gap,  however,  between  the  research  projects  and  the  effective  use  of  ugvs  in  real  naval  operational  applications.  autonomous  vehicles  in  support  of  naval  operations  the  relative  roles  of  unmanned  ground  vehicles  and  their  airborne  counterparts  roughly  correspond  to  the  relative  roles  of  marines  on  the  ground  and  marines  in  the  air.  unmanned  aerial  vehicles  uavs  can  travel  long  distances,  have  an  excellent  vantage  for  seeing  large  areas,  and  have  easier  lines  of  sight  for  communications.  in  many  ways,  aerial  vehicles  are  easier  to  build,  deploy,  and  control.  some  jobs,  however,  must  be  done  from  the

__label__controloptimizationautonomy systems  that  fulfill  unmet  mission  needs  in  ways  other  than  automating  the  operational  procedures  currently  used  by  manned  systems.  the  main  integration  issue  for  improved  naval  ugv  operations  arises  with  the  conduct  and  the  products  of  reconnaissance,  surveillance,  and  target  acquisition  rsta  activities.  the  use  of  ugvs  in  motion  or  perching  ashore  offers  promise  of  an  effective  and  inexpensive  monitoring  capability  in  support  of  shore  bombardment  and  preinvasion  preparation  of  the  battlefield.  in  order  to  reap  the  full  benefit,  the  imagery  needs  to  be  formatted  and  indexed  compatibly  with  rsta  products  available  from  other  navy  and  other  service  systems.  thus,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy ugvs  with  rsta  capability  could  use  internet  protocol  packets  for  communication  to  participate  in  the  global  information  grid  gig  and  could  use  gps  coordinates  for  positioning  information  when  possible.  in  certain  situations  gps  is  not  available  to  a  ugvfor  example,  in  tunnels,  caves,  some  urban  environments,  or  in  a  jamming  environment.  one  of  the  goals  of  increasing  the  autonomy  of  ugvs  is  to  decrease  the  operational  demand  on  marines  in  the  field.  the  current  mode  of  controlling  ugvs  locally  creates  a  burden  and  a  distraction  for  the  operator.  for  longrange  scouting  missions,  the  control  of  ugv  systems  could  be  accomplished
__label__controloptimizationautonomy from  onboard  ship  or  from  a  secure  facility.  if  significant  advances  in  autonomy  can  be  accomplished,  the  control  could  be  integrated  into  the  commandandcontrol  system  used  for  uavs.  on  the  other  hand,  in  the  case  of  ugvs  used  in  close  cooperation  with  ground  forces  such  as  for  mine  clearance  to  support  advance  from  a  beachhead,  it  will  be  essential  that  the  control  of  the  ugvs  be  possible  from  the  forwarddeployed  units  at  a  low  echelon  of  command.  this  arrangement  will  facilitate  flexible  response  as  the  tactical  situation  unfolds  in  the  field.  the  advancement  of  ugvs  is  dependent  on  a  wide
__label__controloptimizationautonomy variety  of  technologies  that  have  matured  to  very  different  levels.  manipulators,  arms,  sensors,  and  basic  mobility  have  been  critical  to  commercial  robotics  for  several  decades  and  are  well  developed  for  controlled  environments.  perception,  planning,  and  navigation  in  cluttered  and  unpredictable  environments  are  much  less  developed.  in  order  to  make  useful  progress,  it  is  essential  to  focus  on  the  system  as  a  whole,  beginning  with  a  clear  mission  need  and  taking  into  account  during  the  development  of  vehicles  the  entire  range  of  considerations  in  the  use  of  the  vehicle.  such  considerations  include  the  following:  how  will  the  system  be  tested  and

__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  research  and  development  efforts  be  aimed  at  these  types  of  practical  considerations,  framed  by  a  clearly  defined  mission  task  description.  one  way  to  focus  research  on  these  types  of  issues  is  to  develop  realworld  challenges  and  competitions  that  encourage  researchers  to  focus  on  accomplishing  a  mission  in  a  realworld  environment  with  a  view  of  the  systems  requirements.  allowing  developers  to  compare  the  capabilities  of  their  machines  would  provide  regular  benchmarks  of  the  state  of  the  art.  such  competitions  might  be  sponsored  by  professional  societies  or  dod  entities,  but  they  could  be  encouraged  by  navy  participation,  as  appropriate,  and  by

__label__controloptimizationautonomy but  they  are  heavy  and  impose  a  large  logistics  burden.  remotesensing  techniques  provide  a  partial  solution  but  are  inadequate  in  the  surf  zone  and  on  land  areas  with  vegetative  cover.  seal  teams  sometimes  aided  by  aquatic  mammals  are  very  effective,  but  mine  detection  and  clearance  in  surf  zones  and  beach  areas  are  dangerous,  timeconsuming  processes.  the  very  shallow  water/surf  zone  mine  countermeasures  program  is  working  to  address  these  issues.  surf  zone  technology  needs  the  surf  zone  is  an  extremely  challenging  environment  for  autonomous  vehicles.  particular  issues  in  this  environment  are  mobility,  perception,  communications,  and  energy  storage.  since  the  surf  zone
__label__controloptimizationautonomy is  rather  unique  to  the  navy  mission,  the  technology  needs  for  ugvs  operating  in  the  surf  zone  are  not  likely  to  be  addressed  by  the  other  services  or  the  commercial  sector.  sensors  and  sensor  data  interpretation  there  is  a  strong  need  for  advanced  sensing  systems  for  ugvs.  very  little  sensor  development  has  been  specifically  driven  by  the  needs  of  ground  robots.  thus,  many  sensors  that  would  be  useful  on  ugvs  are  large  and  heavy  and  have  a  very  narrow  field  of  view.  sensors  for  local  ugv  navigation,  in  contrast,  must  be  small  enough  and  light  enough  to  be  mounted  on

__label__controloptimizationautonomy need  to  be  interpreted  by  computer  algorithms  in  order  to  generate  useful  information.  in  particular,  the  ability  to  automatically  distinguish,  for  example,  between  a  soft  bush  and  a  hard  rock,  a  hard  surface  and  quicksand,  a  fixed  obstacle  and  an  unpredictable  pedestrian,  is  important  for  path  planning  of  usvs.  autonomous  vehicles  in  support  of  naval  operations  planning  and  behaviors  the  onboard  automated  planning  of  vehicle  actions  is  a  fairly  mature  technology  at  present,  but  there  are  significant  needs  in  this  area  as  well.  it  is  straightforward  to  plan  an  appropriate  route  using  a  stored  map  and  to  update  that  route
__label__controloptimizationautonomy as  new  information  is  received  and  added  to  the  map.  it  is  more  difficult  to  automatically  plan  and  execute  maneuvers  that  include  multiple  cooperating  vehicles  in  the  presence  of  unknown  terrain  and  unknown  threat  conditions.  at  the  lowest  level  of  robot  driving,  the  fastest  loops  of  the  control  system  are  referred  to  as  behaviors  instead  of  deliberative  plans.  typical  robot  behaviors  include  reflexive  obstacle  avoidance,  road  following,  formation  keeping,  or  steering  to  avoid  tipping  over  on  steepsided  slopes.  building  individual  behaviors  is  often  possible  with  current  technology,  but  how  to  combine  multiple  behaviors  into  a  coherent  system  is  still  not

__label__controloptimizationautonomy be  key.  as  this  transition  to  autonomous  vehicles  takes  place,  the  need  for  connectivity,  data  consumption,  security  and  innovation  will  become  infinitely  more  important,  and  automotive  manufacturers  will  focus  increasing  energy  on  connecting  vehicles  to  the  cloud  using  iot  technology.  from  autonomous  vehicles  to  citywide  wifi,  iot  is  helping  advance  smart  cities.  few  people  understand  the  implications  of  connected  vehicles  better  than  stephen  surhigh,  vp  of  cloud  solutions  for  harman  international,  who  discussed  the  topic  at  last  weeks  in  san  francisco.  all  of  these  different  technologies  out  there  right  now  are  somewhat  held  at  bay  in  terms  of  their  ability
__label__controloptimizationautonomy to  connect  with  vehicles,  but  all  that  is  going  to  change,  predicted  surhigh.  how  soon?  he  cited  studies  projecting  that  by  2040,  5075  percent  of  the  traffic  on  the  roadways  will  be  autonomous.  during  the  session,  surhigh  discussed  how  interconnectivity  will  become  increasingly  important  for  autonomous  vehicles  everything  from  managing  traffic  flows  to  individualizing  experiences,  collaborating  for  efficiency  and  orchestrating  engagement.  leading  the  way  in  this  arena  is  ,  an  endtoend  cloudbased  platform  designed  to  support  vehicle  immersion  into  a  broader  iot  ecosystem  that  enables  manufacturers  to  accelerate  their  autonomous  vehicle  visions.  in  addition  to  enabling  connectivity,  the  platform  also
__label__controloptimizationautonomy assists  automakers,  dealers  and  service  providers  with  device  management,  application  enablement,  analytics  and  managed  services  capabilities.  manufacturers  can  use  the  platform  to  help  meet  customer  needs  not  only  for  safety  and  convenience  but  also  for  information  and  entertainment  by  easily  deploying  and  managing  new  cloud  applications  and  services.  surhigh  believes  harman,  a  samsung  company,  is  well  positioned  to  play  a  major  role  in  securely  bringing  the  connected  car  into  the  iot  ecosystem.  we  have  a  secure  pipe  where  were  going  directly  from  ignite  in  the  cloud  into  the  vehicle,  and  then  were  managing  the  orchestration  and  security  federation  with  other
__label__controloptimizationautonomy clouds,  said  surhigh.  harman  ignite  offers  other  benefits  to  auto  manufacturers  as  well,  including  shortening  time  to  market,  providing  crossplatform  newmarket  opportunities  and  facilitating  access  to  innovation  and  best  practices  via  harmans  solution  accelerators  and  global  partnership  pool.  to  that  end,  surhigh  emphasized  that  as  more  apps,  services  and  platforms  are  developed  to  deliver  connected  vehicle  content  and  services  through  the  cloud,  it  becomes  increasingly  important  to  manage  interactions  in  a  central  cloudbased  location.  this  allows  for  the  integration  of  multiple  systems  and  processes,  allowing  new  business  models  and  revenue  streams  to  be  realized  in  the  vehicular  ecosystem.  surhigh  also
__label__controloptimizationautonomy noted  that  the  transition  to  autonomous  vehicles  is  already  impacting  not  only  automotive  manufacturers,  but  other  enterprises  that  want  to  be  able  to  leverage  autonomous  vehicle  technology  as  part  of  their  business  model.  this  is  car  sharing,  ride  sharing,  delivery  companies  companies  that  have  an  interest  in  integrating  the  autonomous  vehicle  into  their  business  workflow,  explained  surhigh.  so  all  of  this  is  really  driving  a  need  and  driving  a  business  model  to  look  at  more  and  more  connectivity  with  the  vehicle,  and  connecting  that  vehicle  to  the  outside  world.  according  to  surhigh,  the  main  areas  of  focus  for  autonomous  vehicles
__label__controloptimizationautonomy include  vehicle  operations  the  technologies  that  allow  the  car  to  be  driverless  and  invehicle  content  the  infotainment  that  will  be  included  in  the  car  to  occupy  passengers.  today,  vehicles  have  millions  of  pixels  in  the  vehicle;  its  going  to  ratchet  up  to  billions  of  pixels,  he  said.  so  what  youre  going  to  see  is  much  greater  opportunity  to  start  streaming  video  into  vehicles,  and  to  start  streaming  other  content,  multiple  streams,  into  the  vehicle  in  and  of  itself.  surhigh  also  emphasized  that  increased  data  needs  a  fully  autonomous  vehicle  is  expected  to  generate  1tb  of  data  per  day  will  require
__label__controloptimizationautonomy greater  bandwidth  utilization  requirements:  every  oem  is  currently  looking  at  .  as  auto  manufacturers  and  other  enterprises  think  about  what  steps  they  can  take  today  to  boost  efficiency  and  lower  costs  in  offering  customers  a  connected  lifestyle  experience,  theyd  be  wise  to  keep  an  eye  on  harman  ignite.  surhigh  convincingly  made  the  case  that  the  platform  is  wellpoised  to  maximize  security  and  scalability  for  connected  car  services  and  applications,  now  and  in  the  future.  learn  more  about  some  federal  initiatives  aimed  at  ,  designed  to  advance  the  technology.  posts  by  robin  madell  serves  as  an  awardwinning  copywriter,  ghostwriter,  and  speechwriter

__label__controloptimizationautonomy this  marks  the  first  time  that  data  collection  is  available  from  a  collaborative  robot.  called  ,  it  displays  key  performance  indicators  kpis  via  a  customizable  dashboard  on  the  robots  onboard  display,  making  it  accessible  directly  on  the  factory  floor.  the  same  charts  are  also  fed  back  to  the  intera  studio  platform  for  other  members  of  the  manufacturing  team.  sawyer,  the  popular  collaborative  robot  from  rethink  robotics,  now  can  operate  in  the  internet  of  things  with  its  new  intera  software.  the  software  turns  the  robot  into  a  datacollecting  device.  we  spoke  with  jim  lawton,  chief  operating  officer  of  rethink  robotics,  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy learn  more  about  interas  latest  software  developments,  what  users  are  looking  for  from  their  robots,  and  what  the  future  of  robotics  may  bring  for  the  next  five  years.  you  know  were  very  fortunate  to  have  some  customers  that  we  work  with  who  are  supportive,  vocal,  and  are  constantly  giving  us  ideas.  many  of  our  updates  in  our  software  releases  come  directly  from  the  feedback  of  our  customers  and  some  visionary  folks.  so  many  of  our  customers  are  now  starting  to  think  about  how  to  use  smart  robots  in  conjunction  with  the  internet  of  things  iot.  many  of  them  have  initiatives
__label__controloptimizationautonomy in  iot,  but  are  unsure  where  to  start.  in  some  cases,  people  just  started  storing  the  data,  but  theyre  still  kind  of  unclear  what  theyre  going  to  do  with  it.  the  approach  we  have  taken  is  to  start  from  the  bottom  and  up;  forget  about  trying  to  do  over  complicated  processes  and  lets  just  start  getting  some  basic  data  about  how  things  are  operating  in  the  work  cell  and  on  the  line.  thats  going  to  help  guide  us  over  time  to  figure  out  in  what  way  to  use  the  data,  how  to  calculate  the  proper  analytics,  and  how  to  apply
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  data.  this  particular  release  of  intera  was  released  with  this  goal  in  mind;  to  help  our  customers  get  started  with  basic  data  gathering.  it  sounds  rudimentary,  but  just  having  information  on  cycle  time,  loop  time,  or  even  how  many  products  passed  inspection  can  provide  great  value.  its  surprising  how  many  manufacturers  dont  have  access  to  basic  data;  the  new  software  allows  our  users  to  get  started.  intera  insights  drives  more  informed  production  decisions  and  saves  manufacturers  time  and  money  by  eliminating  the  need  to  invest  in,  or  create,  another  datacollection  system.  along  with  the  datagathering  ability,  we  have  improved
__label__controloptimizationautonomy our  onboard  vision  by  pairing  it  with  external  cameras,  making  it  easy  to  integrate  external  equipment  with  our  software.  this  will  allow  manufacturers  to  optimize  cycle  time  with  improved  vision,  or  leverage  inhouse  vision  systems  on  sawyer.  we  added  joint  indicators  on  the  head  so  that  you  can  where  the  robotic  arms  relative  to  the  range  of  motion  in  that  joint  this  gives  the  robot  the  ability  to  untangle  its  arms.  also  new  in  the  release  is  the  ability  to  edit  programmed  patternsnot  just  in  the  software,  but  on  the  head  of  the  robot  as  well,  providing  ease  of  use
__label__controloptimizationautonomy in  programming.  intera  insights  can  provide  data  information  directly  on  the  headup  display  located  on  the  robot.  softwares  role  helps  makes  robotics  ubiquitous.  due  to  their  ease  of  use,  robots  will  find  homes  in  several  industries,  including  healthcare  and  even  fastfood  services.  our  robots  are  safe  by  design,  making  them  inherently  safe.  the  work  that  has  been  done  in  the  controls,  from  a  mechatronics  perspective,  provides  safety  via  collision  detection  and  object  vision  detection.  this  is  what  places  them  in  the  collaborative  robot  category.  from  a  software  point  of  view,  we  provide  training  for  our  customers,  which  also  helps  us
__label__controloptimizationautonomy determine  any  software  errors  that  could  cause  safety  concerns  from  operator  use.  safety  is  a  large  part  of  any  software  release  evaluation.  the  robots  are  force  sensing,  so  they  can  track  and  monitor  the  force  being  applied  over  time.  they  can  provide  insight  into  the  force  being  applied  at  different  axes  and  different  points  along  the  work  cell.  they  can  provide  data  on  torque,  loop  count,  part  count,  arm  speed,  arm  location  during  pattern  execution,  state  of  the  gripper,  and  the  overall  distribution  of  all  this  data  overtime.  currently,  you  do  have  the  capability  to  extract  the  raw  data,  but
__label__controloptimizationautonomy you  have  to  be  fairly  capable  with  the  process  and  software.  it  is  an  expert  process  today,  but  in  the  future,  we  look  to  make  it  more  straightforward.  we  want  to  make  it  easy  for  everybody  to  be  able  to  bring  out  the  data,  so  we  will  be  looking  at  broader  and  easiertouse  solutions  rather  than  more  technically  oriented  solutions.  i  believe  that  will  be  the  number  one  request  going  forward.  all  of  this  data  is  helpful,  but  how  am  i  going  to  be  able  to  combine  it  with  other  data  sources  or  upload  it  to  the  cloud?  i  suspect
__label__controloptimizationautonomy that  the  next  wave  of  updates  will  be  tracking  the  data  and  where  it  will  be  put  into  the  database  and  the  cloud  from  a  local  server.  customers  want  to  be  able  to  start,  operate,  and  analyze  that  data  in  even  more  significant  ways,  or  combine  it  with  data  coming  from  other  sources.  then  they  can  start  doing  some  interesting  work.  intera  studio  can  be  found  on  the  programming  computer  connected  to  the  robot.  it  allows  user  access  to  programming  patterns  and  data  insights.  based  on  the  study  you  are  referring  to,  we  went  through  and  looked  at  a  bunch
__label__controloptimizationautonomy of  different  robots  for  potential  weaknesses.  a  handful  of  things  were  identified  that  fell  into  two  categories.  one  of  them  consisted  of  things  that  we  had  already  identified  in  a  previous  release.  all  of  the  robots  now  run  intera  5,  so  the  security  issues  found  in  that  study  related  to  a  previous  software  build.  however,  a  couple  of  the  security  issues  listed  in  that  report  were  done  by  design  for  softwaredevelopment  kit  sdk  users  in  particular.  several  of  our  users  are  professors  or  instructors,  and  they  require  root  access  to  the  robot  software.  these  users  are  not  operating  in  the
__label__controloptimizationautonomy intera  software  at  all;  they  control  the  robot  directly  through  the  sdk  software  build.  securitynot  just  for  robots  but  all  connected  deviceswill  become  like  the  antivirus  model.  hackers  are  constantly  looking  for  new  ways  to  access  your  data,  and  we  as  users  will  constantly  be  looking  to  try  and  gain  a  couple  steps  ahead  in  trying  to  stop  them.  its  a  really  exciting  time  to  be  thinking  about  the  role  that  robots  are  going  to  play.  theyre  going  to  evolve  over  time  and  start  taking  on  interesting  tasks.  five  years  from  now,  were  going  to  look  back  at  what  has
__label__controloptimizationautonomy been  achieved  with  robots  and  not  believe  it  to  have  been  possible.  as  much  as  people  can  list  the  next  five  cool  features  of  robotics,  there  are  going  to  be  five  features  no  one  ever  expected  to  be  achievable.  follow  us:
__label__controloptimizationautonomy ,  a  leading  global  consumer  robot  company,  designs  and  builds  robots  that  empower  people  to  do  more  both  inside  and  outside  the  home.  irobot  created  the  homecleaning  robot  category  with  the  introduction  of  its  roomba  vacuuming  robot  in  2002.  today,  irobot  is  a  global  enterprise  that  has  sold  more  than  25  million  robots  worldwide.  irobots  product  line,  including  the  roomba  and  the  braava  family  of  mopping  robots,  features  proprietary  technologies  and  advanced  concepts  in  cleaning,  mapping,  and  navigation.  irobot  engineers  are  building  an  ecosystem  of  robots  and  data  to  enable  the  smart  home.  the  first  amazon  prime  day  was  a
__label__controloptimizationautonomy good  one  for  .  on  that  july  day  in  2015,  the  company  sold  14,000  of  its  roomba  robotic  vacuums.  this  oneday  sales  number  underlined  the  reputation  for  innovation  and  value  irobot  had  built  among  its  customers.  it  also  underlined  a  challenge  irobot  would  face  just  a  few  months  later,  in  september,  when  the  company  would  release  its  first  internetconnected  roomba  vacuums.  roomba  vacuums  are  popular  prime  day  purchases  and  holiday  gifts,  and  people  want  to  try  them  out  as  soon  as  possible,  says  ben  kehoe,  a  cloud  robotics  research  scientist  at  irobot.  so  there  are  certain  days,  particularly  after  big
__label__controloptimizationautonomy sales  events  like  prime  day,  when  a  large  number  of  customers  send  their  newly  purchased  roomba  vacuums  on  their  first  cleaning  missions.  in  july  2015,  spikes  in  new  roomba  use  did  not  directly  impact  the  companys  daytoday  operations.  but  starting  that  september,  large  numbers  of  people  trying  out  the  new  connected  roomba  vacuums  would  result  in  large  volumes  of  traffic  through  the  irobot  home  app,  the  mobile  app  customers  would  be  using  to  set  up  and  control  their  connected  robots.  in  other  words,  irobot,  which  had  so  far  operated  primarily  as  a  hardware  vendor,  was  about  to  bet  its  central
__label__controloptimizationautonomy line  of  business  on  its  ability  to  run  a  highavailability,  customerfacing  cloud  application  and  an  internet  of  things  iot  backend  platform.  it  was  a  gamble  that  paid  off.  today,  irobot  reports  that  connected  roomba  vacuums  operate  in  more  than  60  countries,  with  total  sales  of  connected  robots  projected  to  reach  more  than  2  million  by  the  end  of  2017.  irobot  isnt  stopping  there.  not  only  is  the  company  sending  its  connected  roomba  vacuums  to  save  us  from  the  drudgery  of  vacuuming;  the  company  believes  these  robots  can  one  day  help  solve  a  problem  that  has  so  far  prevented  the  iot
__label__controloptimizationautonomy industry  from  delivering  on  the  true  promise  of  smarthome  technologies:  a  house  that  simply  knows  what  to  do  and  reacts  accordingly.  as  always,  however,  irobot  remains  focused  on  its  central  value  proposition:  leadingedge  robots  that  relieve  customers  from  menial  chores  and  give  them  time  for  whats  more  important.  that  customer  focus  is  why  irobot  started  offering  connected  roomba  vacuums.  customers  are  demanding  easier  ways  to  interact  with  a  growing  number  of  products  and  technologies  throughout  the  home,  says  kehoe.  cloud  connectivity  provides  roomba  customers  with  even  more  convenience  and  control,  so  they  can  use  their  phones  to  manage  their  roomba,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy wherever  and  whenever  its  convenient.  in  2013,  as  it  planned  the  platform  that  would  be  the  foundation  of  this  new  offering,  irobot  decided  to  build  it  in  the  public  cloud.  for  the  initial  launch,  irobot  worked  with  a  vendor  that  provided  a  turnkey  solution  for  launching  the  first  cloudconnected  roomba  in  september  2015.  however,  as  irobot  began  to  build  out  its  family  of  connected  roomba  vacuumsand  as  the  sheer  number  of  connected  customers  and  services  quickly  multipliedirobot  recognized  it  needed  a  solution  that  could  scale  more  quickly  and  allowed  for  more  direct  control.  following  the  launch  of  our  first  connected

__label__controloptimizationautonomy is,  the  location  and  purposes  of  each  room,  and  where  the  homes  various  smart  devices  are  located.  according  to  kehoe,  connected  robots  like  the  roomba  hold  the  key.  irobots  roomba  900  series  vacuums,  for  example,  use  visual  simultaneous  localization  and  mapping  vslam  technology  to  navigate  an  entire  level  of  a  home.  as  the  roomba  vacuums,  it  builds  a  map  of  the  home,  and  it  is  this  map  that  could  provide  the  foundational  information  needed  to  help  a  smart  home  understand  itself  and  enable  truly  seamless,  autonomous  home  automation.  while  todays  roomba  is  creating  maps  to  clean  more  effectively,  future  generations
__label__controloptimizationautonomy of  roomba  vacuums  could  combine  these  maps  with  additional  sensors  and  supportive  cloud  services  to  manage  the  myriad  smart  devices  within  a  home.  as  straightforward  as  this  vision  is  to  state,  its  quite  challenging  to  achieve,  but  kehoe  says  its  possible  in  the  aws  cloud.  the  information  pathways  for  something  like  this  are  incredibly  complicated,  security  for  customer  information  is  crucial,  and  execution  wont  ultimately  be  possible  without  powerful  artificialintelligence  and  dataanalysis  tools.  thats  why  were  building  all  this  in  the  aws  cloud.  amazon  web  services  is  the  key  to  making  this  vision  a  reality.  learn  more  about  .  learn

__label__controloptimizationautonomy 94  percent  of  accidents  are  caused  by  human  error,  adds  alan  amici,  a  vice  president  of  automotive  engineering  at  te.  cars  with  advance  safety  features  and  eventually,  selfdriving  cars,  can  significantly  reduce  the  number  of  collisions.  the  impact  of  this  innovation  can  be  farreaching,  including  reduced  demand  on  emergency  response  systems  and  reduced  auto  insurance  and  health  care  costs.  what  technology  makes  selfdriving  cars  possible?  its  really  three  technologies,  amici  says:  sensors,  connectivity,  and  software/control  algorithms.  most  of  the  sensors  required  for  autonomous  driving  are  available  today  and  are  used  in  advanced  safety  features  such  as  blindspot  monitoring,  lanekeep  assistance,
__label__controloptimizationautonomy and  forward  collision  warning,  he  says.  sensors  for  other  features  such  as  radar,  ultrasonics,  and  cameras  provide  the  input  necessary  to  navigate  the  car  safely.  connectivity  means  cars  have  access  to  the  latest  traffic,  weather,  surface  conditions,  construction,  maps,  adjacent  cars,  and  road  infrastructure,  he  says.  this  data  is  used  to  monitor  a  cars  surrounding  operating  environment  to  anticipate  braking  or  avoid  hazardous  conditions.  finally,  software/control  algorithms  are  needed  to  reliably  capture  the  data  from  sensors  and  connectivity  and  make  decisions  on  steering,  braking,  speed,  and  route  guidance.  by  far  the  most  complex  part  of  selfdriving  cars,  the  decisionmaking  of
__label__controloptimizationautonomy the  algorithms,  must  be  able  to  handle  a  multitude  of  simple  and  complex  driving  situations  flawlessly,  amici  says.  the  software  used  to  implement  these  algorithms  must  be  robust  and  faulttolerant.  two  of  the  most  talked  about  selfdriving  advancements  come  from  google  and  tesla.  they  take  different  approaches:  google  is  using  lidar  a  radarlike  technology  that  uses  light  instead  of  radio  waves  sensor  technology  and  going  straight  to  cars  without  steering  wheels  or  foot  pedals.  tesla  has  rolled  out  a  software  system  called  autopilot,  which  employs  hightech  camera  sensors  as  a  cars  eyes,  to  some  of  its  cars  already  on  the

__label__controloptimizationautonomy consumer  reports  has  slammed  teslas  autopilot  as  being  unsafe  when  changing  lanes  and  behind  the  average  capability  of  a  human.  a  recent  tesla  update  enabled  certain  models  to  automatically  switch  lanes,  in  what  the  manufacturer  said  is  to  make  driving  more  seamless.  in  testing,  consumer  reports  found  a  range  of  dangerous  problems.  the  feature  had  a  tendency  for  cutting  in  without  leaving  enough  space,  and  even  breaking  state  laws  in  terms  of  passing  other  vehicles.  jake  fisher,  senior  director  of  auto  testing  at  consumer  reports,  said:  the  systems  role  should  be  to  help  the  driver,  but  the  way  this  technology
__label__controloptimizationautonomy is  deployed  its  the  other  way  around.  its  incredibly  nearsighted.  it  doesnt  appear  to  react  to  brake  lights  or  turn  signals,  it  cant  anticipate  what  other  drivers  will  do,  and  as  a  result,  you  constantly  have  to  be  one  step  ahead  of  it.  the  update  arrived  last  month  as  part  of  a  package  improving  teslas  driver  assist  features.  drivers  must  first  enable  the  feature  to  give  the  car  permission  to  make  lane  changes.  a  lane  switch  can  be  cancelled  by  holding  the  steering  wheel,  using  the  turn  signal  stalk,  or  braking.  david  friedman,  vp  of  advocacy  at  consumer  reports,  comments:

__label__controloptimizationautonomy but  what  happens  if  your  tenant  has  multiple  domains  for  example  us.contoso.com,  or  fr.contoso.com?  since  these  domain  names  do  not  match,  the  device  will  not  be  configured  for  autopilot.  however,  both  domains  are  part  of  the  same  aad  tenant,  and  as  such  it  was  determined  the  matching  scheme  was  not  useful.  this  was  improved  upon  by  making  use  of  the  tenant  id.  by  using  the  tenant  id,  we  can  determine  that  if  the  user  signs  into  a  domain  with  a  tenant  matching  the  one  they  registered  with,  we  can  safely  consider  this  to  be  a  match.  the  fix  for  this

__label__controloptimizationautonomy litigation  is  nothing  new  for  the  auto  industry.  but  recent  lawsuits  surrounding  accidents  involving  selfdriving  vehicles  show  that  electronically  stored  information  esi  is  a  key  component  in  these  cases,  because  modern  cars  collect  enormous  amounts  of  data,  which  can  be  used  to  determine  the  fault  of  accidents,  whether  its  human  or  machine  driver  error,  or  some  other  design  flaw  in  the  automobile  itself.  selfdriving  cars  continue  to  become  a  regular  part  of  daily  life.  but  like  any  new  technology,  flaws  and  usererrors  become  more  apparent  as  theyre  taken  from  the  test  bed  to  the  real  world.  while  were  still  years
__label__controloptimizationautonomy away  from  truly  autonomous  vehicles  ruling  the  roads,  the  question  that  continues  to  come  up  with  driverassisted  technologies  is  whether  they  protect  us  against  human  error,  or  if  human  reliance  on  technology  makes  drivers  less  competent.  the  following  cases  show  how  selfdriving  cars  and  the  data  they  collect  will  continue  to  highlight  the  role  ediscovery  plays  when  it  comes  to  the  internet  of  things  and  all  the  new  data  sources  that  everyday  devices  create.  in  march  of  2018,  pedestrian  elaine  herzberg  was  killed  by  one  of  ubers  selfdriving  cars  as  she  crossed  a  multilane  road  in  tempe,  arizona.  the  investigation
__label__controloptimizationautonomy included  data  from  the  car  as  well  as  dashcam  video.  while  it  was  determined  that  the  automatic  braking  system  was  turned  off  to  avoid  erratic  driving  conditions,  the  human  driver,  rafael  vazquez,  was  found  at  fault  for  the  death.  dashcam  video  showed  vasquez  repeatedly  looking  down  at  her  lap  in  the  final  minutes  before  the  crash,  includingthe  five  secondsbefore  impact.  additional  esi  provided  from  the  drivers  hulu  account,  shows  that  vazquez  was  streaming  the  television  show  the  voice  just  before  the  crash.  if  the  driver  had  been  paying  attention,  the  cars  data  showed  that  the  accident  most  likely  could  have
__label__controloptimizationautonomy been  avoided.  in  march  2019,  jeremy  banners  tesla  model  3  collided  with  a  tractortrailer  that  was  crossing  his  path  on  a  florida  highway.  an  investigation  is  currently  underway,  as  his  family  is  suing  tesla  for  wrongful  death.  a  preliminary  report  from  the  national  transportation  safety  boardrevealed  banner  turned  on  autopilot  just  before  the  crash,  and  the  vehicle  did  not  detect  the  drivers  hands  on  the  steering  wheel.  this  incident  is  similar  to  a  2016  accident  which  killed  40yearold  joshua  brown  when  a  tractortrailer  crossed  his  path  while  he  was  using  autopilot.  tesla  said  in  that  investigation  that  itscamera  systemfailed  to
__label__controloptimizationautonomy recognize  the  whitebroadsideof  the  truck  against  the  bright  sky.  however,  it  was  also  found  that  brown  was  not  paying  attention  to  the  road,  though  thentsb  said  a  lack  of  safeguards  contributed  to  his  death.  in  this  incident,  mallory  harcourt  of  santa  barbara,  claims  that  in  december  2018,  while  unloading  groceries  from  her  tesla  model  x  parked  in  the  driveway,  her  twoyearold  son  jumped  in  the  drivers  seat,  and  the  car  unexpectedly  lurched  forward,  ultimately  pinning  her  to  the  garage  wall.  harcourt,  who  was  pregnant,  suffered  a  broken  leg  and  pelvis,  and  went  into  labor,  which  led  to  the  premature  delivery
__label__controloptimizationautonomy of  her  daughter.  the  plaintiff  and  defendant  are  in  agreement  that  the  vehicle  was  shifted  from  park  into  drive.  because  the  model  x  and  older  model  s  dont  have  a  drivingfacing  camera  like  the  model  3,  tesla  cant  confirm  how  this  happened.  but  the  cars  data  does  confirm  that  the  brake  pedal  was  released  shortly  after  the  vehicle  was  put  into  drive,  and  the  accelerator  pressed  for  the  following  seven  seconds,  interrupted  briefly  by  application  of  the  brake  pedal.  the  impact  occurred  with  the  left  rear  door  still  open  and  prior  to  an  application  of  the  brake  pedal  heavy  enough
__label__controloptimizationautonomy to  activate  the  antilock  brakes.  there  have  been  other  lawsuits  against  tesla  for  unintended  acceleration  but  none  have  been  won.  conclusion:  what  is  clear  from  each  of  these  cases  is  how  vital  the  role  of  esi  collected  from  vehicles  and  periphery  devices  is  when  determining  cause  and  liability.  in  these  cases,  the  combination  of  video,  car  data  indicating  things  as  detailed  as  how  long  acceleration  and  brakes  were  applied,  whether  someone  was  in  the  drivers  seat  or  their  hands  were  on  the  wheel,  whether  a  door  was  open,  and  when  impact  occurred,  and  esi  from  other  devices  such  as  a
__label__controloptimizationautonomy tablet  or  a  drivers  hulu  account,  were  all  part  of  the  investigations.  as  the  internet  of  things  continues  to  grow,  items  that  were  once  merely  mechanical  devices  phones,  cars,  refrigerators,  etc.  are  now  repositories  of  electronic  evidence.  and  should  litigation  arise,  the  data  they  contain  must  be  made  discoverable.  these  scenarios  involving  selfdriving  cars  may  not  fall  under  the  daytoday  operations  of  most  law  firms,  but  they  do  highlight  new  examples  of  how  electronic  data  is  collected  during  litigation  which  is  ediscovery.  in  the  same  way  that  email  data  was  still  a  novel  source  of  evidence  15  years  ago  or
