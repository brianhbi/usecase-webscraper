__label__situationalsurveillance in  particular,  lets  look  at  five  areas  where  retailers  are  taking  advantage  of  iot:  with  the  rapid  growth  of  online  shopping,  retailers  are  very  keen  to  bring  the  frictionless  customer  experience  of  online  shopping  into  the  store  wherever  they  can.  they  want  access  to  the  same  type  of  rich  data  and  highperformance  analytics  that  retailers  use  to  drive  websites  and  mobile  shopping  trips.  their  goal  is  to  have  that  same  limitless  control  to  craft  a  customer  experience  and  collect  detailed  data  to  help  them  predict  how  customers  will  shop.  the  differentiation  with  iot  will  come  from  a  retailers  ability  to

__label__situationalsurveillance even  in  the  more  traditional  surveillance  mode,  aipowered  video  cameras  can  provide  added  functionality,  pettersson  writes:  similarly,  convenience  stores  like  amazon  go  employ  cameras  with  advanced  object  recognition  software  to  confirm  which  items  shoppers  pick  and  ensure  proper  payment.  powered  by  deep  learning  technology,  amazons  store  cameras  use  complex  pattern  recognition  to  detect  when  products  are  taken  off  the  shelf.  the  cameras  can  even  track  when  a  customer  put  objects  back.  while  the  cameras  double  as  a  means  to  prevent  shoplifting,  their  primary  function  is  to  improve  the  customer  experience  and  support  amazons  mission  of  providing  unmatched  convenience  for  shoppers.
__label__situationalsurveillance the  advances  in  cctv  technology  are  due  to  two  factors,  according  to  pettersson.  advanced  object  detection:  indepth  behavioral  analysis:  p  the  breakthroughs  producing  the  arcules  video  platform,  according  to  pettersson,  comes  from  technology  moving  beyond  the  rulebased  algorithms  that  have  provided  video  analysis  in  the  past  to  now  making  use  of  ai  and  machine  learning  so  cameras  get  a  brain.  arcules  announcement  of  its  platform  said  that  it  is  powered  by  technology  from  milestone  systems,  the  global  industry  leader  in  video  management  software.  milestone  xprotect  is  open  video  management  software  vms  with  published  apis  that  allow  developers  to  modify  the

__label__situationalsurveillance the  networkcentric  security  and  surveillance  industry  enabled  by  the  ipbased  cameras  has  been  steadily  progressing  over  the  years.  now  the  advent  of  the  internet  of  things  iot  promises  to  turn  this  segment  into  a  mass  surveillance  infrastructure.  however,  the  crossover  between  iot  and  surveillance  is  also  demanding  the  edge  devices  like  security  cameras  to  get  connected  as  well  as  get  smart.  in  other  words,  move  more  imaging  and  video  analytics  to  camera  and  process  information  directly  inside  the  smart  camera.  so,  in  this  facet  of  iot,  where  surveillance  machines  are  becoming  part  of  the  network  of  connected  devices,  it  is
__label__situationalsurveillance imperative  that  edge  devices  like  security  cameras  acquire  some  level  of  intelligence  while  some  of  the  data  is  sent  to  the  cloud  servers.  take  the  use  case  of  object  recognition  in  the  context  of  home  security  and  surveillance.  first,  an  object,  for  example,  a  person  is  recognized.  next,  the  camera  has  to  identify  if  the  person  is  part  of  the  list  of  approved  people  that  have  access  to  the  home  or  building.  then,  the  camera  must  identify  the  situation;  for  instance,  if  the  person  has  fallen  or  has  entered  a  certain  area  that  is  prohibited  for  him.  so  the  camera
__label__situationalsurveillance system  may  simply  create  a  notification  in  the  form  of  a  message  or  a  call.  apparently,  its  hard  for  the  cloud  to  respond  to  all  the  data  quickly  enough  because  data  transfer  isnt  always  that  fast.  the  data  transfer  in  the  cloud  environment  isnt  realtime  either,  as  some  people  might  have  believed.  sometimes,  even  the  network  link  to  the  cloud  is  down.  iot  surveillance  apps  like  scene  analysis  demand  local  intelligence  inside  cameras  now  consider  another  use  case:  smart  city.  image  and  video  resolution  are  going  up  due  to  the  proliferation  of  cheap  cameras.  but  it  also  requires  more  bandwidth.
__label__situationalsurveillance there  can  be  1,000  cameras  in  a  smart  city,  and  it  will  take  too  much  of  bandwidth  while  they  are  all  connected  to  the  cloud.  all  of  them  will  need  to  transfer,  handle  and  store  massive  data  quantities.  so  moving  more  video  analytics  to  the  camera  can  reduce  cloud  server  processing.  moreover,  having  local  analytics  power  in  end  devices  like  surveillance  cameras  can  limit  data  traffic.  its  worth  noting  that  cloud  cant  do  everything  no  matter  how  good  processing  engines  and  algorithms  are.  then,  power  could  be  concern  for  devices  like  smart  meters,  which  will  drain  too  much  of  power
__label__situationalsurveillance in  transmitting  all  the  data  to  the  cloud.  there  could  also  be  regulation  at  some  stage  in  the  future  about  the  cloud  usage  amid  privacy  issues.  the  monitoring  of  elderly  at  home,  for  instance,  may  simply  require  a  phone  call  after  the  transmission  of  an  alarm  signal.  on  the  other  hand,  people  may  hesitate  to  buy  cloudcentric  safety  products  because  of  privacy  concerns.  there  are  devices  like  amazons  echo  smart  speaker  cum  personal  assistant  and  dysons  360  eye  robot  that  cleans  floors  without  human  help.  is  a  cloudconnected  wireless  speaker  that  employs  local  audio  analytics  to  carry  out  voice  control

__label__situationalsurveillance the  processing  and  storage  load,  push  data  around  intelligently.  the  growth  in  the  development  of  edgebased  ai  chips  from  ,  and  others,  along  with  ever  more  powerful  gpus,  reflects  this.  as  does  open  iot  edge  platforms  like  .  analyze  video  at  the  edge;  strip  the  metadata;  dont  push  raw  data  across  networks  in  real  time.  but,  although  edge  processing  in  silicon  drives  efficiency  and  reliability,  it  also  prioritizes  local  processing  over  a  distributed,  intelligent  architecture.  it  fixes  the  selection  of  an  ai  engine  at  the  edge.  it  prevents  openaccess  innovation  without  a  hardware  investment.  not  easy  to  blend  edge  and
__label__situationalsurveillance center  when  the  data  is  live  video  at  a  spiky  bitrate  inviting  latency  and  packet  loss.  and  so  this  shift  to  ai  at  the  edge  addresses  latency  and  bandwidth,  but  it  comes  at  a  cost.  to  deliver  the  full  cloudedge  architecture  for  live  video,  there  have  to  be  limits  on  the  amount  of  data  that  needs  to  move  at  zero  latency  in  real  time.  systems  at  the  edge  sit  within  a  distributed,  fully  connected  architecture  that  can  operate  in  either  an  online  or  offline  mode.  a  distributed  architecture  is  not  simply  a  structure,  it  needs  to  be  realworld  proofed  and
__label__situationalsurveillance adaptable.  data  needs  to  be  focused  and  cut  into  manageable  packets  for  live  transmission  and  processing.  edge  and  central  systems  need  to  work  in  lockstep.  available  bandwidth  needs  managing  efficiently.  one  example  of  just  such  a  distributed  architecture  in  action  comes  from  the  militarys  increasing  reliance  on  drones.  picture  an  urban  battlefield,  with  a  number  of  drones  dispatched  to  locate  hostile  combatants  known  to  be  hiding  out.  lightweight  processing  on  the  drones  can  detect  where  people  are  detected  in  inferred  hiding  places.  these  detections  and  possible  locations  can  then  be  sent  to  the  cloud  for  more  rigorous  analytics,  including  deeper
__label__situationalsurveillance processing  and  crossreferencing  input  from  multiple  sensors,  all  to  distinguish  between  combatants  and  cowering  locals:  essentially,  object  detection  and  classification  at  the  edge,  with  object  matching  on  result  sets  at  the  center.  as  the  military  moves  forwards  with  ever  more  focus  on  drones,  including  the  management  of  swarms  of  flying  battlefield  objects,  physical  communication  and  coordination  become  a  major  challenge.  the  equation  is  the  balance  of  weight,  power  and  processing.  it  comes  down  to  architecture.  seamless,  intelligent  connectivity  is  the  real  vision  for  edgeai.  not  the  rush  to  equip  edge  devices  and  sensors  with  evercheaper  ai  silicon  and  dedicated  gpus.
__label__situationalsurveillance distributed  processing,  designed  to  balance  a  lightweight  edge  with  alimitless  center,  built  to  deliver  splitsecond  decision  making  on  realtime  data,  relies  on  that.  many  iot  video  devices  will  be  mobile,  with  the  additional  stress  on  video  codecs  from  the  frame  to  frame  scene  change  with  a  moving  sensor.  5g  is  imminent  but  not  a  panacea  for  the  sheer  scale  of  the  networking  challenge.  quality  of  service  and  universality  of  any  specific  offering  will  be  front  of  mind.  solutions  need  to  override  issues  with  congestion  and  coverage.  networking  between  cloud  and  edge  has  to  be  designed  into  the  architecture  of  solutions.
__label__situationalsurveillance and,  in  addition  to  efficiency,  this  brings  further  benefits:  intelligently  distributed  architectures  are  a  prerequisite  for  live  video  analytics.  the  fusion  of  cloud  and  edge,  with  efficient  use  of  bandwidth  and  processing,  underpins  the  next  stage  of  development.  this  means  cloud  and  iot  and  networks  working  in  lockstep.  and  it  means  evolving  our  approach,  such  that  surveillance  ai  operates  across  systems,  rather  than  being  locked  on  sensors.  what  will  be  interesting  is  the  impact  these  developments  have  on  the  broader  ai  landscape,  beyond  video  and  surveillance.  if  heavy  data  can  be  intelligently  packaged  and  moved  around  a  network  instantly,  at

__label__situationalsurveillance cameras  to  the  internet  at  large  is  a  clear  trend.  given  the  of  ip  cameras  deployed  globally,  a  small  portion  of  ip  cameras  that  expose  themselves  on  the  public  domain  can  serve  as  a  great  incentive  for  hackers.  another  thing  to  consider  is  how  network  isolation  is  one  of  the  frequently  mentioned  approaches  for  cybersecurity.  being  in  a  local  area  network,  though,  does  not  guarantee  the  protection  of  ip  cameras  against  hacking.  for  one  thing,  welldesigned  malware  can  easily  spread  across  the  local  area  network,  and  any  portable  device  brought  into  the  same  local  area  network  can  easily  turn  into
__label__situationalsurveillance an  infection  vector.  take  the  infamous  mirai  botnet  as  an  example:  a  windowsbased  trojan  plays  an  important  role  to  distribute  it,  even  though  the  targets  are  ip  cameras  that  run  on  linux.  a  complete  functionality  offered  by  an  ip  camera  often  consists  of  the  camera  itself,  the  network  capability,  and  the  cloud  services.  to  offer  a  secure  product,  manufacturers  need  to  implement  security  strategies  in  an  overarching  approach  from  the  device  to  the  cloud:  p  camera  hardware.  2.  networking.  deploying  ip  cameras  within  a  closed  network  is  already  a  highly  adopted  mechanism  to  ensure  a  better  level  of  security.  virtual
__label__situationalsurveillance private  networks  vpns  can  be  used  to  enable  remote  access  with  a  secure  connection.  other  networkrelated  security  implementations  include:  cloud.  as  with  other  iot  devices,  there  are  a  lot  of  moving  parts  in  a  complete  ip  camerabased  application.  accordingly,  no  one  could  and  should  be  held  solely  responsible  in  the  event  of  a  security  incident.  from  a  cybersecurity  standpoint,  we  believe  everyone  plays  a  role  in  making  security  fully  realized.  the  traditional  business  model  for  an  ip  surveillance  system  is  a  onetime  payment.  in  a  diy  market,  the  end  users  simply  purchase  the  ip  cameras  and  install  them  in  the
__label__situationalsurveillance existing  network  environment.  more  complicated  cases  will  introduce  system  integrators,  who  basically  handle  everything  for  the  users,  including  selecting  the  right  hardware,  fixing  them  at  desired  locations,  wiring  them  to  outgoing  routers,  and  setting  up  the  network.  its  also  a  onetime  payment  if  the  maintenance  contract  is  not  figured  in.  as  more  parties  are  trying  to  monetize  on  the  basis  of  ip  surveillance  services,  many  different  business  models  crop  up  to  fulfill  different  needs.  surveillance  service  providers  now  charge  users  monthly  fees  instead  of  a  onetime  payment,  and  so  do  internet  service  providers  isps.  new  players  in  this  business  not
__label__situationalsurveillance only  provide  video  surveillance  systems  for  users,  but  also  offer  valueadded  services  such  as  cloud  recording  and  all  sorts  of  smart  features.  to  this  point,  the  lines  between  the  involved  parties  in  this  industry  are  getting  blurred.  for  example,  nest  is  not  only  the  manufacturer  of  the  nest  cam  security  camera,  but  its  also  the  service  provider  that  facilitates  the  associated  cloud  recording  service.  regardless  of  all  the  working  components  in  the  industry,  there  are  groups  of  people  and  entities  that  play  critical  roles  in  the  cybersecurity  of  surveillance  systems:  device  manufacturers.  service  providers.  system  integrators.  end  users.  identifying  the
__label__situationalsurveillance roles  and  responsibilities  for  security  is  not  a  matter  of  knowing  who  one  is  but  rather  a  matter  of  knowing  what  one  does  .  in  a  diy  market,  the  home  user  also  plays  the  role  of  a  system  integrator.  in  the  same  manner,  the  ip  camera  vendor  not  only  plays  the  device  manufacturer  role  but  also  the  service  provider  role  since  all  the  apps  and  cloud  services  are  also  developed  and  maintained  by  the  vendor  itself.  in  all  scenarios  that  we  can  think  of,  we  find  it  easy  to  communicate  security  accountability  and  responsibility  by  mapping  an  involved  entity  into
__label__situationalsurveillance any  of  the  four  aforementioned  roles.  security  is  a  common  issue  for  manufacturers  of  internetconnected  devices  and  ip  camera  hardware  manufacturers  are  no  exception.  to  be  sure,  the  more  cybersecurity  implementations  are  added,  the  more  obvious  the  increase  in  cost  will  be  from  the  bill  of  material  bom  list.  on  the  other  hand,  since  cybersecurity  is  now  a  topic  with  high  awareness  in  the  industry  and  even  among  end  users,  ip  camera  manufacturers  can  also  take  this  opportunity  to  create  unique  value  in  the  market  instead  of  pursuing  an  endless  price  war.  cybersecurity  implementations  can  also  be  used  to  put
__label__situationalsurveillance forth  decisive  factors  for  requests  for  quotations  rfqs,  especially  those  from  public  domains,  now  that  cybersecurity  has  attracted  further  government  scrutiny.  for  service  providers  or  system  integrators,  this  cost  issue  may  become  less  critical  because  security  implementations  can  be  an  optional  item  and  can  be  transferred  to  the  monthly  bill  of  the  end  users  who  really  care  about  such  matters.  complexity  is  another  form  of  cost  for  better  cybersecurity.  the  easiest  way  to  get  everything  set  up  is  always  the  cheapest  and  the  most  unsecure  one.  trading  ease  of  use  for  cybersecurity  is  common  sense  among  it  experts  but  not
__label__situationalsurveillance for  general  users.  for  example,  if  a  surveillance  system  is  to  allow  remote  access  over  the  internet,  the  adoption  of  vpns  is  often  on  the  list  of  top  suggestions  for  security.  however,  accessing  a  device  with  a  vpn  is  not  a  common  practice  among  general  users,  especially  smartphone  users.  the  neverending  debate  between  the  costs  and  the  benefits  of  cybersecurity  can  only  be  expected  to  keep  on,  with  companies,  no  matter  the  size,  continuing  to  weigh  all  the  contributing  factors  to  their  iot  implementations  while  striving  to  maintain  functionality  and  security.  although  classified  as  iot  products,  ip  cameras  had  already
__label__situationalsurveillance been  in  the  market  even  before  the  term  internet  of  things  or  iot  was  coined.  but  in  spite  of  the  market  maturity  of  ip  cameras,  the  cybersecurity  concerns  surrounding  them  are  still  a  big  challenge  for  the  entire  industry.  as  with  other  iot  devices  and  services,  the  information  flow  for  ip  cameras  is  a  long  chain  and  malicious  attacks  can  surface  anywhere.  companies  that  monetize  on  iotrelated  businesses  have  developed  awareness  of  cloud  security  for  quite  some  time  as  well  as  the  cybersecurity  matters  on  the  network  connection.  the  lack  of  sufficient  cybersecurity  implementations  in  devices  is  the  next  thing

__label__situationalsurveillance devices  are  usually  not  so  capable  as  those  computing  units  in  huge  data  centres,  and  for  this  sake,  in  practice,  engineers  choose  to  compromise  for  limited  capacity  of  embedded  computing  and  limited  memory,  e.g.,  neural  network  models  being  pruned  to  fit  embedded  devices.  visual  object  tracking  is  one  of  many  important  elements  of  a  smart  city,  and  in  the  iot  and  edge  computing  context,  high  requirements  to  computing  power  and  memory  space  severely  prevent  massive  and  accurate  tracking.  in  this  paper,  we  report  on  our  contribution  to  object  tracking  on  lightweight  computing  including  1  using  limited  computing  capacity  and  memory

__label__situationalsurveillance smart  city,  have  actually  used  iot  and  edge  computing  for  communication  and  computation  infrastructure.  here  is  an  example  of  object  tracking:  in  order  for  selfdriving  cars  to  become  a  reality,  those  cars  need  to  react  to  external  factors  in  realtime.  the  moving  objects  such  as  cars  and  pedestrians  always  bring  considerable  uncertainty  to  the  selfdriving  system.  if  a  selfdriving  car  can  track  the  trajectories  of  moving  objects  on  the  road,  it  will  perceive  both  normal  and  sudden  movements  of  its  surroundings.  once  abrupt  lane  changing  is  detected,  the  car  must  slow  down  immediately.  if  a  selfdriving  car  is  traveling  down

__label__situationalsurveillance can  record  ones  movement.  however,  in  iot  and  edge  computing  context,  high  requirement  to  computing  power  and  memory  of  traditional  computer  vision  techniques  severely  prevent  massive  object  tracking.  in  this  paper,  we  focus  on  lightweight  object  tracking  that  requires  less  computation,  less  memory,  and  less  data  transmission.  lightweight  object  tracking  needs  an  elegant  algorithm  and  implementation.  there  are  two  major  problems  for  the  existing  tracking  algorithms.  first,  it  is  the  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness.  visual  object  tracking  is  a  challenging  task,  especially  when  faced  with  difficult  tracking  conditions  e.g.,  occlusion,  object  deformation  and  background  cluttering.  the  ability  to  handle  these
__label__situationalsurveillance difficulties  directly  influences  the  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness  of  a  tracking  algorithm.  recently,  the  adoption  of  discriminative  learning  method  in  visual  tracking  field  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  promotion  of  tracking  accuracy  and  speed.  these  methods  usually  train  a  classifier  online  in  the  first  frame  and  then  search  among  candidate  patches  using  the  trained  classifier  in  the  following  frames.  in  2010,  bolme  et  al.  adopted  the  property  of  circulate  matrix  for  training  a  ridge  regression  model  as  the  classifier.  thus,  the  correlation  response  can  be  calculated  efficiently  in  the  frequency  domain  and  the  proposed  tracker,  as  first  discriminative  correlation  filter
__label__situationalsurveillance dcf  method,  enjoys  low  computation  complexity.  however,  no  feature  extraction  is  implemented  in  ,  thus,  the  tracking  ability  is  limited  by  the  feature  discrimination.  then,  henriques  et  al.  ,  introduced  histogram  of  gradient  hog  features  into  dcf  methods  and  improved  its  accuracy  and  robustness.  more  inspiring  improvement  to  dcf  trackers  came  from  works  of  danelijan  et  al.  ,  and  galoogahi  et  al.  ,  ,  that  aimed  at  fading  the  boundary  effects  inherited  in  the  circuit  matrix  assumption  of  dcf  trackers.  in  2017,  galoogahi  et  al.  proposed  to  solve  the  zeroaliasing  mosse  filter  by  admm  method  .  the  tracker,  called  bacf,
__label__situationalsurveillance achieves  relative  high  performance  on  benchmarks  and  runs  quite  fast.  however,  bacf  still  can  not  overcome  the  difficult  tracking  conditions  such  as  occlusion  and  object  deformation.  in  our  approach,  we  take  bacf  as  the  baseline  tracker  and  design  concise  frameworks  to  detect  tracking  status,  and  thus,  enhance  the  tracking  accuracy  efficiently.  next,  we  illustrate  another  issue  that  object  tracking  systems  for  edge  computing  context  are  faced  with.  in  order  to  increase  the  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness,  an  obvious  solution  is  to  adopt  more  discriminative  image  features  such  as  deeplearning  features.  deep  convolutional  neural  networkscnns  have  proven  to  be  super  effective
__label__situationalsurveillance on  several  challenging  vision  tasks  ,  ,  ,  e.g.,  object  detection  and  face  recognition.  compared  to  the  handcrafted  features  such  as  hog  and  color  naming  ,  cnn  features  significantly  improve  the  tracking  ability  against  the  target  deformation,  occlusion  and  outofplane  rotation.  however,  extracting  cnn  features  from  deep  convolutional  network  requires  expensive  computation  and  cnn  features  always  have  high  dimensions.  these  properties  ruin  the  computational  efficiency  of  dcf  method.  the  method  such  as  runs  only  5  fps  on  a  quadcore  cpu  at  about  4  ghz.  in  2016,  bertinetto  et  al.  ,  firstly  employed  a  siamese  network  to  combine  the  feature  extraction
__label__situationalsurveillance and  classification  process  jointly,  called  siamesefc.  as  an  endtoend  cnn  architecture,  it  achieves  relative  high  performance  owning  to  the  oneshot  architecture  and  graphics  processing  unit  gpu  acceleration.  although  siamesefc  runs  around  86  fps  on  a  gpu  device,  it  requires  dense  parallel  computation  thus,  conducts  high  power  consumption.  besides,  cnn  methods  require  huge  memory  space,  usually  above  10  megabytes,  to  maintain  its  network  model.  hence,  in  terms  of  power  consumption  and  memory  usage  cnnbased  tracking  algorithms  are  not  suitable  for  iot  edge  applications.  smart  city  applications  tend  to  adopt  iot  and  edge  computing  broadly  for  distributed  data  collection,  communication  and  processing.
__label__situationalsurveillance however,  frontend  sensors  and  devices  are  usually  not  so  capable  as  those  computing  units  in  huge  data  centres,  and  for  this  sake,  in  practice,  engineers  choose  to  compromise  for  limited  capacity  of  embedded  computing  and  limited  memory.  visual  object  tracking  as  an  important  element  of  smart  city  is  a  promising  application  area.  the  crucial  point  for  designing  tracking  systems  in  iot  edge  is  to  keep  a  balance  between  tracking  accuracy  and  computation  complexity.  after  carefully  review  the  recent  development  of  object  tracking,  we  notify  that  although  the  implementation  of  dcfbased  trackers  is  quite  efficient,  tracking  accuracy  of  the  existing  methods
__label__situationalsurveillance is  not  good  enough  for  widespread  usage.  while,  cnnbased  methods,  though  more  accuracy  and  robustness,  require  high  computing  complexity  and  large  memory  space.  hence,  we  propose  a  tracking  algorithm  with  region  proposals  and  tracking  status  detection  schemes.  thanks  to  the  proposed  frameworks,  our  method  can  overcome  difficult  tracking  conditions  such  as  occlusion,  rotation  and  deformation  and,  thus,  dramatically  improves  the  tracking  accuracy.  meanwhile,  it  is  suitable  for  iot  devices  with  limited  computing  capacity  and  memory  space.  this  paper  offers  the  following  contributions:  we  demonstrate  a  visual  object  tracking  system  for  smart  city  applications  using  iot  and  edge  computation  with  limited
__label__situationalsurveillance computing  capacity  and  memory  space.  it  can  fit  most  lowpower  consumption  iot  devices,  e.g.,  xilinx  soc  platforms  and  arm  devices,  hence  provide  flexible  and  energy  conservation  advantages.  we  introduce  a  novel  region  proposal  correlation  filter  algorithm  for  lightweight  computation  tracking.  owing  to  the  concise  region  proposal  scheme  and  feature  combination  strategy,  the  algorithm  runs  around  40  fps  on  edge  devices  and  requires  only  157  kb  onchip  memory.  besides,  response  confidence  level  rcl  is  proposed  to  detect  tracking  status  and  update  tracking  model.  our  embedded  tracking  system  with  proposed  algorithm,  surpasses  existing  systems  for  iot  in  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness.  it
__label__situationalsurveillance can  precisely  track  the  targets  even  when  difficult  tracking  conditions,  e.g.,  occlusion,  deformation  or  background  cluttering,  occur.  the  remainder  of  our  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  in  ,  we  briefly  summarize  the  existing  tracking  systems  and  their  drawbacks.  then,  the  theory  of  discriminative  correlation  filter,  an  efficient  tracking  paradigm,  is  discussed.  next,  we  introduce  related  tracking  methods  based  on  region  proposals.  in  ,  we  firstly  demonstrate  our  object  tracking  architecture  using  iot  and  edge  computing.  second,  the  proposed  tracking  algorithm  is  illustrated  in  detail.  after  explaining  the  solution  to  boundary  effect  of  dcfbased  tracker  by  zeroaliasing  filter,  we  demonstrate  our
__label__situationalsurveillance innovative  approach  of  fetching  the  region  proposals  from  the  correlation  response.  then,  a  robust  criterion  for  judging  the  tracking  status  is  introduced,  based  on  the  responses  peak  value,  psr  and  number  of  proposals.  is  about  the  experiment  and  result.  the  implementation  details  of  our  tracking  system  in  iot  context  are  firstly  put  forward.  next,  we  focus  on  the  system  tracking  performance.  we  evaluate  our  algorithm  with  other  related  trackers  on  two  benchmarks.  the  result  shows  the  computation  efficiency  of  our  proposed  frameworks  on  dcfbased  tracker.  besides,  our  tracker  requires  much  less  memory  space  while  achieves  comparable  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness.
__label__situationalsurveillance the  last  section  is  a  summary  of  the  paper  and  future  prospects  for  object  tracking  system  using  iot  and  edge  computing  are  forecasted.  in  this  section,  we  discuss  the  applications  of  tracking  system  in  iot  and  edge  computing  context  and  the  existing  tracking  algorithms.  the  pros  and  cons  of  the  existing  tracking  systems  are  illustrated.  then,  dcfbased  trackers,  which  are  suitable  for  edge  applications,  are  introduced  in  .  then  in  ,  some  region  proposal  methods  aimed  at  further  enhancing  the  tracking  accuracy  are  discussed.  researchers  at  gartner  estimate  that  there  will  be  20  billion  iot  devices  connected  to  the  internet
__label__situationalsurveillance by  2020  .  in  order  to  process  huge  computation  capacity,  traditional  approaches  are  to  transmit  the  data  generated  by  the  device  to  a  cloud  platform.  however,  there  are  three  major  limitations  for  cloud  computing:  transmit  bandwidth,  power  consumption  and  processing  latency.  an  example  scenario  is  the  camera  surveillance  to  detect  traffic  accidents.  if  the  detection  algorithm  is  deployed  at  the  cloud,  the  bandwidth  requirement  for  hd  videos  as  well  as  high  latency  of  network  transmission  will  ruin  the  efficiency  and  realtime  response  of  the  application,  respectively.  a  sample  scenario  is  a  security  camera  that  records  the  video  when  an  accident
__label__situationalsurveillance happens.  the  application  requires  wide  bandwidth  if  the  whole  video  is  transmitted  and  immediate  response  for  accident  alert.  to  overcome  the  limitations  of  cloud  computing,  the  edge  and  fog  computing  has  been  introduced.  in  ,  edge  datacenter  is  proposed  as  the  middle  layer  to  optimize  the  energy  consumption  and  system  latency.  it  proves  that  for  timesensitive  applications,  edge  computing  is  an  elegant  yet  efficient  solution.  except  for  the  theoretical  studies  on  iot  edge  computing,  the  solutions  to  largescale  deployment  of  iot  edge  in  industries  have  attracted  considerable  attention.  amazon  has  proposed  a  solution  called  aws  iot  greengrass  for  timesensitive  applications.
__label__situationalsurveillance meanwhile,  microsoft  has  also  published  azure  iot  edge  to  extend  the  cloud  service  to  the  edge  side.  the  advantages  of  these  solutions  include  security  and  stability  of  data  transmission,  versatile  toolkits  for  software  development,  low  cost  for  largescale  deployment  and  so  on.  although  powerful  services  have  been  provided  by  large  companies,  specific  systems  and  projects  on  the  iot  edge  devices  still  require  careful  design.  visual  object  tracking  is  such  a  timesensitive  application  and  it  shows  promising  prospect  in  scenarios  such  as  autonomous  vehicles,  smart  city  monitor  and  robotic  vision.  when  designing  object  tracking  algorithms  for  the  iot  edge,  it  is
__label__situationalsurveillance important  to  think  about  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  system.  the  critical  point  is  first  to  understand  the  main  trick  and  consumption  of  the  tracking  algorithm,  and  then  fully  utilize  the  iot  edge  resources.  in  terms  of  object  tracking  applications,  shit,  r.c  et  al.  introduced  sensor  localization  in  iot  infrastructure  and  the  location  information  is  helpful  for  a  coarse  search  of  the  target.  nevertheless,  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness  are  always  the  top  consideration  of  a  tracking  system.  in  traditional  tracking  system  the  accurate  tracking  results  guarantee  the  control  of  frontend  cameras  to  follow  the  interested  targets.  in  2019,  luo  et
__label__situationalsurveillance al.  proposed  a  novel  module  called  active  tracking.  the  system  directly  predicts  the  actions  of  the  camera  rather  than  the  tracking  results.  however,  the  reinforcement  learning  of  control  system  still  requires  high  computation  complexity  and  long  latency.  visual  object  tracking  is  a  lowlatency  application  and  it  shows  promising  prospect  in  scenarios  such  as  autonomous  vehicles,  smart  city  monitor  and  robotic  vision.  when  applying  the  object  tracking  algorithm  at  the  egde  of  iot  network,  energy  efficiency  is  essential,  especially  when  the  devices  are  powered  by  batteries.  another  motivation  towards  energy  profiling  and  enhancement  is  to  reduce  carbon  emissions.  according  to  a
__label__situationalsurveillance study  published  by  the  centre  for  energy  efficient  telecommunications,  the  cloud  was  estimated  to  consume  up  to  43  twh  in  2015,  compared  to  only  twh  in  2012,  an  increase  of  .  this  is  roughly  equivalent  to  adding  million  cars  to  the  roads  .  thus,  it  is  essential  to  understand  the  relationship  between  tracking  algorithms  and  their  respective  energy  consumption  to  efficiently  utilize  the  iot  devices  power  resources.  meanwhile,  tracking  accuracy  is  also  an  essential  consideration.  the  power  consumption  of  the  tracking  algorithm  mainly  depends  on  the  memory  access.  under  45  nm  cmos  technology,  a  32  bit  floating  point  add  consumes
__label__situationalsurveillance 0.9  pj,  a  32  bit  sram  cache  access  takes  5  pj,  while  a  32  bit  dram  memory  access  takes  640  pj,  which  is  3  orders  of  magnitude  of  an  add  operation  .  if  the  model  of  the  tracking  system  is  larger  than  1  megabyte,  we  need  to  store  the  model  in  dram  memory  thus,  it  requires  more  energy  to  access  the  tracker  model.  existing  deep  learning  algorithms,  e.g.,  siamesefc  and  hcf  ,  needs  more  than  50  megabytes  memory  space  to  contain  its  network  models.  although  they  achieves  the  stateoftheart  tracking  accuracy,  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  entire  system  blocks  its
__label__situationalsurveillance widespread  usage  in  iot  edge  devices.  while,  some  traditional  tracking  algorithms  such  as  kcf  and  struck  ,  maintain  a  small  model  capacity  of  less  than  1  megabyte,  however  the  tracking  accuracy  of  these  methods  are  much  lower  than  deep  learning  methods,  especially  when  targets  are  faced  with  difficult  tracking  conditions  e.g.,  occlusion,  deformation,  outofplane  rotation  and  background  cluttering.  discriminative  correlation  filter  indicates  a  category  of  tracking  methodology.  it  was  firstly  introduced  by  in  2010.  since  then,  plenty  of  methods  are  proposed  for  increasing  tracking  accuracy  and  robustness.  a  typical  dcf  tracker  is  trained  using  the  image  patch  ,  centered  around
__label__situationalsurveillance the  target  to  fit  a  desired  relation  response  of  gaussian  distribution.  the  filter  is  obtained  by  minimizing  the  following  objective  function  in  the  spatial  domain:  where  stands  for  circular  correlation  operator.  and  refers  to  the  d  th  channel  of  vectorized  patch  and  the  corresponding  filter  respectively  .  d  is  the  number  of  feature  channels,  n  is  number  of  pixels  in  the  image  patch,  and  is  a  regularization  factor  .  by  applying  parsevals  theorem  to  equation  ,  filter  can  be  obtained  in  the  frequency  domain:  where  ,  and  are  the  discrete  fourier  transfer  of  ,  and  respectively.  a  is  the  elementwise
__label__situationalsurveillance product  between  two  vectors.  then  the  optimal  filter  can  be  solved  efficiently  in  the  frequency  domain  and  is  the  inverse  dft  of  .  since  there  are  more  than  one  training  samples  during  tracking  process.  an  concise  update  scheme  for  renewing  the  regression  filter  is  introduced  by  .  the  update  scheme  can  be  seen  as  minimizing  a  weighted  squared  error,  where  sample  index  j  is  the  frame  number  and  is  the  weight  for  the  training  sample  in  j  th  frame.  we  can  achieve  the  recursive  formula  of  both  nominator  and  denominator  to  the  solution  by  setting  the  for  and  .  is
__label__situationalsurveillance called  learning  rate  for  the  model.  then  the  d  th  channel  of  is  defined  as:  where  is  the  complex  conjugate  of  .  is  the  diagonal  elements  of  ,  which  is  also  the  dft  of  .  the  nominator  and  denominator  is  updated  using  the  predicted  target  patch.  in  the  next  frame,  a  searching  patch  is  cropped  from  the  position  of  last  frame,  then  the  predicted  location  is  at  where  the  maximum  value  of  the  response  map  in  equation  indicates.  although  the  dcfbased  trackers  enjoy  the  computation  efficiency  by  transforming  to  the  frequency  domain,  the  circular  hypothesis  of  brings  boundary  effects  to
__label__situationalsurveillance the  response  map  which  degrades  the  tracking  performance.  th  region  proposal  method  is  firstly  introduced  for  the  visual  detection.  it  is  designed  to  replace  the  sliding  window  approach  by  fetching  potential  object  locations  from  the  whole  frame.  some  of  the  region  proposal  methods  are  based  on  image  segmentation  and  they  treat  different  image  segments  as  object  proposals.  selective  search  uses  a  superpixel  segmentation  algorithm  in  color  space  to  find  image  segments  and  then  merges  the  segments  to  obtain  proposals.  mcg  ,  however,  segments  the  image  based  on  the  edge  cue  on  multiscale  hierarchy  and  merges  the  segments  by  edge  strength.
__label__situationalsurveillance usually,  only  the  top  one  thousand  proposals  are  used  for  the  following  process,  thus,  the  proposals  are  finally  rank  by  a  combination  of  multiple  cues,  such  as  location,  shape,  color  and  edge.  while,  the  shortcoming  of  segmentation  based  approach  is  the  high  computational  complexity.  though  number  of  potential  objects  are  reduced,  it  is  still  timeconsuming  to  fetch  the  credible  proposals.  recently,  new  region  proposal  methods  are  suggested  for  realtime  application.  edgebox  and  bing  are  typical  methods  for  quick  object  proposals.  two  approaches  both  beg  the  segmentation  process  and  directly  score  the  candidate  windows  by  the  property  of  edges  in  the
__label__situationalsurveillance window.  edgebox  gives  a  high  score  to  the  windows  containing  a  large  number  of  edges  and  bing  distinguishes  the  objects  and  backgrounds  by  the  edge  homogeneous  observing  that  edges  of  objects  have  heterogeneous  property.  as  it  is  mentioned  before,  visual  tracking  is  timesensitive.  region  proposal  methods  without  segmentation  are  more  suitable  for  this  kind  of  task.  edgebox  tracking,  ebt  ,  was  presented  in  2016.  it  applies  the  edgebox  as  a  region  proposal  method  and  gets  the  objectlike  candidates  from  the  whole  frame.  the  proposed  candidates  are  passed  to  a  structuresvm  classifier  in  order  to  tell  the  target  from  the  other
__label__situationalsurveillance cluttering  objects.  it  is  a  global  search  strategy  for  target  detection,  however,  only  the  edge  information  is  used  for  classification  so  that  it  suffers  when  motion  blur  happens.  in  2018,  a  new  targetspecific  object  proposal  generation  method  for  tracking  topgt  was  introduced.  different  from  ebt,  topgt  combines  the  edge  cue  and  color  cue  together  to  generate  the  object  proposals  and  then  ranks  the  proposals  by  shape,  color  as  well  as  size  similarity.  after  then,  it  trains  a  cnn  network  with  the  proposals  and  locates  the  target  with  the  highest  network  output  score.  while,  although  the  trained  framework  of  topgt  is
__label__situationalsurveillance fairly  robust  against  deformation  and  motion  blur  the  imbalance  of  positive  and  negative  samples  may  lead  to  target  drift  when  occlusion  happens.  besides,  it  requires  the  cnnmodel  update  during  tracking  and,  thus,  suffers  from  heavy  computation  complexity  and  ruins  the  realtime  property.  an  overview  of  our  system  design  is  shown  in  :  the  system  design  of  our  tracking  system  in  iot  and  edge  computing  context.  the  idea  is  to  use  some  frontend  cameras  that  provide  us  with  an  interface  to  fetch  videos,  a  local  server  that  connects  to  those  local  cameras  and  processes  their  images  using  machine  learning  and  a
__label__situationalsurveillance computer  vision  algorithm,  then  sends  the  processed  data  or  labels  to  the  cloud,  so  we  can  monitor  and  treat  the  cameras  as  sensors  by  knowing  the  content  of  the  videos.  we  can  use  this  to  track  people  or  vehicles  on  the  street,  receive  an  alert  if  something  alarming  happens  in  a  public  space,  or  even  train  a  custom  model  and  allow  authorized  personnel  to  walk  around  a  place.  there  are  many  application  cases  for  using  the  object  tracking  system.  we  are  going  to  use  some  pantiltzoom  ptz  camera  platforms  as  our  frontend  cameras.  use  a  zynq7000  development  board  as  the
__label__situationalsurveillance local  server  we  also  try  on  our  laptops,  that  will  run  a  pretrained  support  vector  machine  svm  model  for  classifying  and  detecting  objects  on  images.  afterwards,  the  tracking  algorithm  starts  to  track  the  detected  object  and  analyzes  the  trajectory  of  the  target.  the  trajectory  is  then  fed  back  to  the  camera  platform  and  used  to  control  the  servo  system  to  follow  the  tracking  target.  thus,  our  system  can  keep  an  eye  on  the  target  by  the  tracking  system.  the  classified  data  is  sent  to  the  cloud  securely  using  a  cloud  iot  core  and  also  leveraging  the  new  gateway  feature,  so
__label__situationalsurveillance the  local  server  can  act  on  behalf  of  the  camera  modules  for  sending  data  to  the  cloud.  then  the  data  is  processed  in  an  eventbased  way  using  firebase  cloud  functions,  that  basically  stores  data  on  firebase  to  make  the  data  available  to  internetconnected  users  on  a  web  interface  deployed  on  firebase  hosting.  also,  the  local  server  will  provide  a  local  web  interface  to  monitor  the  cameras.  the  project  architecture  contains  five  parts  as  shown  in  .  the  project  architecture  of  the  overall  system.  :  responsible  for  searching  the  cameras  using  mdns,  maintaining  a  list  of  devices  on  the  local  network

__label__situationalsurveillance to  keep  the  target  in  view,  the  tracking  algorithm  plays  an  important  role  in  the  overall  system.  in  this  paper,  we  focus  on  the  tracking  algorithm  fitting  for  iot  and  edge  computing  context.  our  algorithm  is  based  on  the  bacf  tracker,  which  aims  at  alleviating  the  boundary  effect  of  dcf  trackers.  in  ,  we  firstly  explain  the  principle  of  bacf.  next,  clarifies  our  region  proposal  framework  based  on  dcf  trackers.  then  in  innovative  criterion  to  detect  the  tracking  status  is  proposed  based  on  hog  and  color  histogram  response.  at  last,  the  strategy  employed  to  combine  multicues  in  our  implementation  is
__label__situationalsurveillance put  forward  in  .  in  order  to  transfer  the  objective  function  of  equation  to  the  frequency  domain,  an  assumption  of  periodic  extension  of  image  patch  is  required  to  ensure  the  applicability  of  the  dft.  due  to  the  periodic  assumption,  a  shifted  image  patch  will  introduce  repetitive  content  of  center  patch  other  than  background  samples  at  the  image  boarder.  it  brings  frequency  aliasing  in  the  frequency  domain,  while  in  the  spatial  domain,  the  background  samples  are  covered,  which  makes  the  filter  lack  discriminative  power.  in  the  bacf  method,  zeroaliasing  correlation  filter  is  employed  to  handle  the  problem.  backgroundaware  correlation  filterbacf  is
__label__situationalsurveillance to  minimize  the  following  objective  function:  where  is  a  binary  matrix  which  holds  the  mid  t  elements  of  feature  channel  .  a  indicates  the  transport  operator.  and  ,  n  is  the  length  of  sample  .  different  from  equation  ,  the  filter  is  of  length  t  ,  where  .  similar  to  the  traditional  dcf  tracker,  equation  can  be  learned  in  the  frequency  domain  for  computational  efficiency.  however,  since  the  zeroaliasing  constraint  of  is  in  the  spatial  domain  we  keep  the  regularization  in  spatial  domain.  then,  the  frequency  domain  expression  of  equation  is  as  follows:  where  is  an  auxiliary  variable  and  is
__label__situationalsurveillance an  orthonormal  dft  matrix,  such  that  the  dft  of  signal  can  be  expressed  as  .  to  solve  equation  ,  augmented  lagrangian  methodalm  is  employed:  where  is  a  lagrangian  vector  in  the  fourier  domain  and  another  regularization  term  to  penalty  the  zeropadding  filter  is  introduced,  which  is  the  penalty  factor.  equation  can  be  solved  iteratively  by  alternating  direction  method  of  multipliers  admms  .  for  simplify  the  process,  we  just  give  the  solutions  to  two  subproblems  and  .  for  more  details,  please  refer  to  ,  .  where  .  it  is  easily  obtained  by  applying  dft  after  masking  with  .  and  are  the
__label__situationalsurveillance crossspectral  and  autospectral  of  sample  with  desired  response  respectively.  where  and  .  they  can  be  efficiently  calculated  by  applying  inverse  dft  of  and  and  then  cropped  them  by  matrix  .  where  and  are  the  current  solutions  to  the  above  subproblems  at  iterations  within  iterative  admm.  the  penalty  factor  is  gradually  increase  within  iterative  admm  and  is  a  increment  parameter.  the  final  discriminative  filter  is  then  solved  iteratively  using  equations  .  similar  to  traditional  dcf  solution,  the  predicted  target  location  is  then  obtained  by  multiplying  filter  with  the  feature  patch  in  frequency  domain.  in  this  section,  we  will  discuss  our  region
__label__situationalsurveillance proposal  approach  based  on  correlation  filters.  unlike  the  general  region  proposal  methods,  such  as  selective  search,  edgebox  and  bing,  that  aim  at  locating  possible  areas  of  all  class  objects,  our  approach  is  designed  to  find  the  candidate  positions  that  contain  similar  objects  with  the  tracking  target.  specifically,  the  proposed  method  treats  the  correlation  filter  as  a  prior  knowledge  and  utilizes  the  correlation  response  to  fetch  similar  objects  among  the  searching  area.  experimental  results  show  that  a  high  recall  ratio  can  be  achieved  with  only  20  proposals  generated,  shows  the  efficiency  of  our  scheme.  then,  feature  combination  strategy  can  be  implied
__label__situationalsurveillance at  the  proposed  candidates  to  enhance  tracking  accuracy.  for  a  singletarget  tracking  task,  the  initial  object  in  the  first  frame  is  known  in  advance.  thus,  a  more  specific  region  proposal  method  can  be  proposed  based  on  the  known  target  model.  unlike  general  region  proposal  methods,  such  as  selective  search,  edgebox  and  bing,  region  proposal  methods  for  tracking  enjoy  the  advantage  of  utilizing  the  tracking  model  as  a  prior.  therefore,  the  proposed  region  proposal  approach  for  tracking  is  computationally  efficient  embedding  into  dcf  framework  meanwhile  it  achieves  high  precision  rate  with  less  than  20  number.  as  we  review  the  implementation  of
__label__situationalsurveillance dcf  trackers,  a  discriminative  filter  keeps  updating  during  the  tracking  process  to  distinguish  the  target  from  background  surroundings.  then,  the  response  map  in  equation  is  calculated  as  the  crosscorrelation  of  the  filter  with  searching  patch  .  generally,  dcf  trackers  set  only  the  location  with  peak  response  value  as  the  prediction  target.  however,  we  notice  through  experiments  that  although  the  regression  objective  is  set  as  a  gaussian  function,  the  actual  response  map  usually  contains  multiple  peak  values  and  the  target  can  be  located  at  suboptimal  peaks,  especially  when  targets  are  faced  with  object  deformation,  background  clustering  or  fast  motion.  there  are
__label__situationalsurveillance two  possible  reasons.  first,  the  model  drifts  always  happen  during  the  tracking  process  and  as  it  accumulates  the  discriminative  power  of  the  correlation  filter  drops.  second,  handcrafted  features  are  not  robust  against  all  kinds  of  tracking  scenarios.  for  example,  the  hog  feature  is  fragile  against  target  rotation  and  deformation;  thus,  distracters  may  have  comparable  responses  as  deformed  targets.  according  to  the  observations,  the  region  proposal  method  based  on  correlation  filters  are  presented.  generally,  in  dcf  trackers,  only  the  maximum  value  location  of  the  response  map  is  used  as  the  prediction  of  the  target.  however,  during  experiments,  we  find  that  sometimes
__label__situationalsurveillance the  target  does  not  locate  at  the  maximum  response  position  especially  when  faced  with  difficult  tracking  status,  e.g.,  occlusion,  fast  motion  and  deformation.  there  are  two  possible  reasons  for  the  phenomena.  first,  in  order  to  limit  the  frequent  aliasing,  a  hanning  window  is  applied  on  the  sample  ,  which  suppresses  the  response  at  the  boarder.  second,  accumulating  of  model  drift  may  decrease  the  discriminative  power  of  the  filter  and  result  in  a  suboptimal  response.  further  investigation  about  the  position  of  the  target  under  such  circumstances  notices  that  though  it  is  not  the  maximum  value  location,  it  always  be  a  local
__label__situationalsurveillance maximum  of  the  surrounding  areas.  based  on  that,  we  present  our  region  proposal  approach  for  dcf  trackers.  all  local  maxima  of  the  response  map  are  firstly  extracted,  where  a  local  maximum  is  defined  as  the  location  with  a  response  value  larger  than  its  eight  connected  neighbors.  next,  keep  only  the  local  maxima  with  response  values  that  are  larger  than  of  the  global  peak  value.  are  chosen  to  be  the  candidates  the  selected  proposals  are  calculated  as  follows:  where  is  the  center  locations  of  proposals  and  denotes  local  maximum  locations.  is  an  indicator  function  of  value  1  at  locations  with  response
__label__situationalsurveillance greater  than  peak,  which  is  the  global  maximum  of  response  map.  after  locating  the  center  positions,  the  proposals  are  generated  by  fetching  boundingboxes  of  the  same  size  at  each  position.  getting  the  center  locations,  we  fetch  the  boundingboxes  using  the  same  patch  size  in  the  dcf  framework.  besides,  nonmaximum  suppression  nms  is  then  used  on  the  proposed  boundingboxes  to  eliminate  heavy  overlapped  pairs.  shows  the  object  proposals  generated  by  our  region  proposal  method  on  videos  from  otb2015  and  vot2016  datasets.  from  ,  there  are  two  regular  patterns  summarized:  from  the  given  sequences,  two  observation  of  patterns  are  catched:  1  the
__label__situationalsurveillance number  of  proposals  is  closely  related  to  tracking  status.  number  of  proposals  increases  when  the  target  is  faced  with  difficult  scenarios  and  vice  versa;  2  groundtruth  boundingbox  always  lays  among  the  proposed  candidate  boundingboxes  unless  tracker  drift  occurs.  illustration  of  the  proposed  dcfbased  region  proposal  method  on  four  different  sequences.  as  mentioned  in  ,  object  tracking  systems  are  faced  with  several  difficult  statuses,  such  as  occlusion,  deformation  and  fast  motion,  during  the  tracking  process.  the  strategies  for  handling  the  difficult  situations  have  major  effects  on  the  performance  of  the  tracker.  the  first  step  towards  a  useful  strategy  for  complex  scenarios
__label__situationalsurveillance is  to  correctly  predict  the  tracking  status.  guan  et  al.  proposed  an  eventtriggered  decision  model  to  predict  the  tracking  status.  it  combines  spatial  and  temporal  loss  with  an  event  decision  tree.  we  adopt  a  concise  implementation  in  view  of  the  region  proposals  from  correlation  filter  response.  elaborates  our  innovative  criterion  to  judge  the  tracking  status.  the  criterion  is  closely  related  to  our  region  proposal  method  in  .  when  demonstrating  the  experiment  on  region  proposal  extraction,  we  notice  that  more  candidates  are  proposed  as  the  target  meets  difficult  situations.  in  view  of  the  connection  between  the  number  of  proposals  and  tracking
__label__situationalsurveillance status,  we  suggest  a  new  criterion  which  combines  peak  value,  peaktosidelobe  ratio  psr  and  number  of  proposals  to  predict  the  tracking  status.  different  from  the  methods  from  ,  ,  the  ratio  between  the  current  frame  and  the  average  value  of  the  past  frames  is  employed  to  indicate  the  tracking  status.  since  the  criterion  is  based  on  the  response  map,  it  is  named  response  confidence  level  .  the  definition  is  as  follows:  where  k  indicates  the  k  th  frames  among  the  sequence.  stands  for  the  maximum  value  of  the  response  map  and  ,  where  and  represent  the  mean  and  standard  derivation

__label__situationalsurveillance boundingboxes  have  been  proposed  in  the  methods  in  ,  how  to  determine  the  most  likelihood  among  proposals  is  still  unresolved.  as  discussed  in  ,  multiple  feature  cues  can  considerably  improve  the  accuracy  and  robustness  of  tracking  performance.  aiming  at  designing  a  tracker  for  realtime  applications,  the  cnnbased  feature  is  not  considered  because  of  the  computational  complexity.  hog  feature,  which  is  the  statistic  of  edge  cue,  is  already  employed  in  bacf  architecture.  other  features  like  shape  or  color  are  taken  into  account.  in  ,  ,  ,  color  cue  is  already  proven  to  be  powerful  combined  with  hog  feature  on  dcf  trackers.
__label__situationalsurveillance we  also  find  that  color  cue  is  robust  against  the  object  deformation  and  rotation  yet  weak  against  illumination  change  and  background  cluttering.  these  properties  are  just  complementary  to  edgebased  features  like  hog.  thus,  the  color  histogram  feature  is  employed  as  the  other  cue  for  the  joint  detection  in  our  approach,  similar  to  the  choice  in  papers  ,  .  to  distinguish  target  pixels  x  from  background  surrounding  pixels,  a  naive  bayes  classifier  is  trained  with  the  color  histogram  of  searching  patch  i  .  given  a  target  region  i.e.,  the  initial  boundingbox  or  the  predicted  area  of  dcf  tracker  and  its  surrounding
__label__situationalsurveillance region  in  i  ,  the  object  likelihood  of  pixels  x  is  obtained  by  bayes  rule:  we  define  a  symbol  to  denote  the  bin  of  histogram  h  calculated  from  region  .  and  stands  for  the  bin  where  color  component  of  belongs  to.  the  conditional  probability  can  be  directly  estimate  by  the  color  histogram,  and  ,  where  calculates  the  total  of  pixels  in  the  area.  besides,  the  prior  probabilities  are  approximate  as  and  respectively.  then,  by  simplifying  equation  ,  we  get  .  the  object  likelihood  map  is  defined  as  ,  where  the  likelihood  of  each  pixels  in  map  i  is  obtained  by
__label__situationalsurveillance equation  .  then,  is  embedded  into  the  region  proposal  framework  to  jointly  combine  color  cue  and  edge  cue  for  detection  the  target.  the  most  intuitive  approach  is  to  use  the  value  of  ,  where  x  is  the  center  location  of  the  proposals.  however,  different  from  response  map  of  dcf  filter,  whose  regression  target  is  a  gaussian  distribution,  the  maximum  response  of  the  likelihood  map  is  usually  not  located  at  the  center  of  the  target.  thus,  we  introduce  a  new  method  to  measure  the  color  similarity  of  the  proposals  by  accumulating  the  value  of  among  ,  where  is  the  boundingbox  area
__label__situationalsurveillance of  the  proposal  k  .  furthermore,  the  accumulated  value  can  be  quickly  calculated  by  integral  of  likelihood  map  .  where  is  the  integral  response  of  likelihood  map  .  is  the  color  histogram  response  of  proposal  k  ,  where  ,  ,  ,  are  the  topleft,  topright,  bottomright  and  bottomleft  corner  coordinates  of  boundingbox  proposal  k  .  then  the  combined  response  of  proposals  k  is  generated  by  multiplex  the  response  of  hog  feature  with  the  response  of  color  histogram  together  as  follows:  shows  the  architecture  of  the  region  proposal  correlation  filter.  the  potential  boundingboxes  are  proposed  from  the  response  of  the  correlation
__label__situationalsurveillance filter,  generated  by  the  baseline  tracker  bacf.  then,  different  feature  cues  can  be  extracted  from  the  candidates  which  dramatically  enhances  the  robustness  of  proposed  tracker  meanwhile  reduces  the  computation  redundancy.  in  this  paper,  we  combine  the  edge  cue  of  hog  response  with  the  color  cue  of  histogram  to  achieve  realtime  tracking  performance  of  about  30  fps.  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  framework  is  shown  in  .  moreover,  this  architecture  can  be  flexibly  expanded  to  combine  other  feature  cues,  including  shape,  texture  or  deep  cnn  features.  architecture  of  the  overall  region  proposal  correlation  filter.  when  a  new  frame  comes,  one  loop
__label__situationalsurveillance of  region  proposal  correlation  filter  algorithm  is  summarized  in  algorithm  1.  extract  the  hog  feature  of  the  input  image  patch  x  and  translate  it  to  frequency  domain  .  calculate  the  response  of  feature  patch  with  zeroaliasing  filter  and  find  the  original  position  with  peak  response.  and  .  generate  the  proposals  from  the  response  map  according  to  equation  and  get  final  k  candidates:  by  nonmaximum  suppression.  compute  the  response  confidence  level  in  terms  of  equation  .  calculate  the  object  likelihood  of  each  proposals  by  color  histogram  according  to  equations  .  combine  the  response  of  hog  feather  with  the  color  histogram  according

__label__situationalsurveillance passes  those  images  through  the  tracker.  after  the  tracking  process,  edgeserver  sends  only  compressed  information  to  cloud  iot  core  and  provides  the  data  to  the  local  web  interface.  we  will  discuss  the  implementation  details  of  edgeserver  in  .  another  critical  design  in  the  system  is  the  tracking  algorithm,  which  keeps  a  balance  between  tracking  accuracy  and  energy  consumption.  we  evaluate  our  proposed  algorithm  on  the  widely  used  benchmarks  and  metrics.  the  benchmark  result  of  our  tracking  algorithm  compared  with  the  related  methods  indicate  the  effectiveness  of  our  region  proposal  framework  on  dcf  trackers.  at  the  end  of  this  section,  several

__label__situationalsurveillance implement  our  edgeserver  on  a  xilinx  soc  platform,  as  it  is  shown  in  ,  the  proposed  tracking  system  in  fact  can  be  extended  to  many  edge  platforms  with  arm  or  x86  cores,  e.g.,  ,  stm32  series  and  so  on.  since  the  overall  system  requires  only  157  kb  memory  and  runs  in  realtime  tracking  performance  on  a  dualcore  cpu  at  1  ghz,  the  system  can  implement  flexibly.  zynq7000  platform  as  the  edgeserver.  as  we  have  mentioned,  it  is  especially  important  to  understand  the  relationship  between  algorithms  and  their  respective  energy  consumption  to  efficiently  utilize  the  iot  devices  power  resources.  based  on
__label__situationalsurveillance the  platform  of  our  edgeserver,  we  dedicate  on  designing  an  energyconservation  tracking  algorithm  on  dualcore  processing  unit  and  the  implementation  details  about  our  algorithm  are  then  discussed  in  .  followed  by  ,  the  31  dimensional  hog  feature  of  cell  size  is  employed  in  our  bacf  filter.  the  searching  area  is  set  to  be  5  times  of  the  target  size  in  order  to  handle  difficult  tracking  situations,  e.g.,  fast  motion  and  occlusion.  the  regularization  factor,  in  equation  ,  is  set  as  .  a  scale  variation  process  referred  to  is  implemented,  with  the  number  of  scales  and  size  step  setting  to  3

__label__situationalsurveillance of  the  target  and  background  surroundings  are  both  updated  in  order  to  catch  the  target  deformation  during  tracking.  however,  unlike  the  traditional  strategy,  that  updates  the  model  per  frames,  we  propose  a  new  update  scheme  based  on  the  proposed  criterion.  only  the  confidential  tracking  results  are  considered  as  reliable  training  samples.as  mentioned  in  ,  is  a  combination  of  peak  value,  peaktosidelobe  ratio  and  the  number  of  proposals.  through  experiment,  we  observe  that  when  and  drop  to  around  or  there  are  more  than  3  number  of  proposals,  the  tracking  results  are  usually  unreliable.  it  usually  happens  on  account  of  difficult  tracking
__label__situationalsurveillance status,  e.g.,  deformation,  motion  blur  or  occlusion.  thus,  we  set  the  threshold  of  to  be  .  tracking  results  with  larger  will  be  used  to  update  the  bacf  filter  and  the  color  histograms.  based  on  the  selective  update  scheme,  the  learning  rates  for  bacf  filter  and  color  histograms  are  then  set  to  and  respectively.  our  method  is  firstly  evaluated  on  the  otb2015  benchmark,  which  contain  100  sequences.  the  performance  of  all  trackers  is  measured  by  two  indicators,  namely  op  and  dp.  op  metric  measures  the  percentage  of  frames  with  iou  scores  that  are  greater  than  a  threshold,  where  iou  is  the
__label__situationalsurveillance intersection  over  unioniou  of  predicted  and  ground  truth  bounding  boxes.  we  compare  the  trackers  using  threshold  of  iou  .  the  areaunderthecurve  auc  of  plot  metric  is  also  employed  to  rank  the  trackers.  while,  dp  metric  measures  the  percentage  of  frames  with  the  center  distances  of  predicted  and  groundtruth  bounding  boxes  less  than  a  threshold.  the  percentage  at  threshold  of  20  pixels  is  reported  for  all  trackers.  in  the  experiment,  we  apply  the  onepassevaluationope  followed  methodology  in  .  vot2016  is  also  applied  to  show  the  robustness  of  the  trackers.  vot2016  dataset  contains  60  challenging  sequences  and  it  provides  a  evaluation  toolkit
__label__situationalsurveillance to  measure  the  trackers,  which  will  reinitial  the  tracker  to  correct  position  once  failure  occurs.  the  expected  average  overlap  is  proposed  to  rank  the  trackers,  which  combines  the  perframe  accuracy  and  failures.  we  evaluate  our  tracker  with  15  stateoftheart  trackers  includes  kcf  ,  struck  ,  fdsst  ,  srdcf  ,  mdnet  ,  ccot  ,  siamesefc  ,  hcf  ,  tcnn  ,  lct  ,  stapleca  ,  ptav  ,  topgt  ,  ecohc  ,  mccth  and  samf  on  two  benchmarks  otb2015  and  vot2016.  the  results  on  the  two  challenging  benchmarks  show  the  accuracy  and  energy  efficiency  of  our  tracker,  especially  on  otb2015  dataset,  our  approach
__label__situationalsurveillance surpasses  all  of  the  stateoftheart  trackers  for  realtime  application  with  only  157  kb  model  parameters.  we  firstly  demonstrate  the  effective  of  our  region  proposal  framework  on  dcf  tracker  by  comparing  the  performance  of  our  method  with  baseline  tracker:  bacf  and  other  related  trackers:  samf  ,  staple  ,  srdcfad  ,  srdcf  and  lmcf  .  otb2015  benchmark  is  used  to  evaluate  the  trackers.  shows  the  results  of  both  dp  and  op  plots  on  otb2015  benchmark.  compared  with  6  relevant  trackers,  our  proposed  tracker  achieves  top  performance  on  both  dp  and  op  plot  of  evaluations,  with  precision  and  overlap  respectively.  the  dp  metric
__label__situationalsurveillance gains  increments  and  op  metric  gains  opposed  to  baseline  tracker:  bacf.  meanwhile,  owing  to  the  concise  architecture  of  combining  edge  and  color  cues  on  region  proposals  our  approach  runs  at  fps,  even  faster  compared  to  the  original  35  fps  implementation  of  bacf.  the  srdcf  tracker,  another  method  to  limit  the  boundary  effect  of  correlation  filter,  achieves  precision  and  overlap  respectively  while  only  runs  less  than  10  fps.  samf  and  staple  are  two  related  trackers  that  combine  the  edge  and  color  cues  to  jointly  track  the  target.  same  feature  cues  are  implemented  in  our  framework,  however,  on  account  of  the  region
__label__situationalsurveillance proposal  methodology  the  combination  of  edge  of  color  cues  becomes  more  robust  and  efficient.  it  can  be  seen  from  that  compared  to  samf  tracker,  our  approach  has  gain  in  auc  scores.  with  regards  to  staple,  our  tracker  also  achieves  an  average  of  improvement.  otb2015  results  of  related  trackers.  is  a  summary  of  our  approach  and  6  other  relevant  trackers.  distance  precision  indicates  the  percentage  at  threshold  of  20  pixels  error,  high  dp  score  means  the  trackers  precisely  follow  the  groundtruth  of  the  target.  and  then  overlap  precision  measures  the  percentage  with  score  greater  than  ,  higher  op  score  guarantees  that
__label__situationalsurveillance the  trackers  predict  the  exact  scale  variation  of  the  target.  the  last  column,  mean  fps,  indicates  the  average  running  speed  among  all  sequences  in  the  dataset.  since  all  of  the  listed  algorithm  is  employed  on  the  same  processor,  higher  fps  demonstrates  the  computation  efficiency  of  the  algorithms.  although  our  tracker  is  not  the  fastest  algorithm,  our  tracking  performance  in  dp  and  op  score  both  rank  .  we  compare  our  algorithm  with  cnnbased  tracker  on  vot2016  dataset.  when  evaluated  on  dataset,  all  of  the  tracking  parameters  keep  exactly  the  same  as  its  implementation  in  otb2015  dataset  in  order  to  test  the
__label__situationalsurveillance generalization  of  our  proposed  tracker.  we  evaluate  the  trackers  in  accordance  with  accuracy,  expected  average  overlapeao  and  parameter  size.  the  accuracy  measures  the  average  overlap  ratio  between  the  predicted  bounding  box  and  the  groundtruth.  and  eao  combines  the  raw  values  of  perframe  accuracies  and  failures,  and  then  measures  the  expected  noreset  of  a  tracker  run  on  a  a  shortterm  sequence  .  the  model  parameter  size  measures  the  memory  space  required  by  an  algorithm.  higher  the  accuracy  or  eao  score  are,  better  the  tracker  is.  on  the  contrary,  fewer  model  parameters  indicates  less  memory  access  and  thus,  the  algorithm  enjoys  more
__label__situationalsurveillance energy  conservation.  the  tracking  results  are  shown  in  .  expected  overlap  scores  in  vot2016  challenge  for  stateoftheart  trackers.  different  from  otb2015  dataset,  vot2016  challenge  employs  a  scheme  that  tracker  will  be  reinitialized  after  each  drift  and  count  for  one  failure.  thus,  vot2016  dataset  mainly  focus  on  shortterm  tracking.  from  we  notice  that  all  top  performance  trackers  like  ccot,  tcnn,  mdnet  and  hcf  employ  deeplearning  feature  rather  than  handcrafted  one  because  of  high  distinguish  ability  of  deep  feature.  moreover,  in  terms  of  our  rpcf  tracker,  it  introduces  to  selfdetect  the  possible  drift  of  tracker.  and  then  tracker  searches  potential  objects  among
__label__situationalsurveillance region  proposals  and  stops  update  the  targets  models.  even  if  tracking  failure  occurs,  rpcf  tracker  may  correct  itself  in  the  following  process.  the  schemes  have  less  influence  in  vot2016  evaluation.  even  though  our  tracker  ranks  in  eao  score,  only  behind  two  deepfeature  trackers,  ccot  and  tcnn.  however,  ccot  and  tcnn  implement  vgg19  as  backbone  network  to  collect  deep  feature,  thus,  the  model  parameter  size  of  the  trackers  are  more  than  300  megabytes.  from  we  can  notice  that  comparing  with  stateoftheart  cnnbased  trackers  our  rpcf  tracker  has  the  comparable  performance  with  only  157  kb  parameter  size.  fewer  parameter  size  illustrates  less
__label__situationalsurveillance memory  access  when  processing  the  algorithm,  and  thus,  leads  to  low  power  consumption.  demonstrates  the  tracking  performance  of  our  algorithm  under  different  tracking  status.  besides  the  overall  performance  of  the  trackers  among  all  the  sequences,  there  are  manually  labeled  attributes  to  all  of  the  sequences,  which  indicate  the  difficult  situations  happen  during  the  tracking  sequence.  the  performance  on  the  associated  attribute  sequences  shows  the  trackers  capability  of  handling  the  specific  tracking  situation.  there  are  total  of  11  attributes  in  otb2015  dataset,  namely  scalevariation,  inplain  rotation,  out  of  view,  background  cluttering,  illumination  variation,  motion  blur,  fast  motion,  deformation,  outof  plain  rotation,
__label__situationalsurveillance occlusion  and  lowresolution.  in  ,  trackers  performance  under  different  tracking  conditions  is  shown.  owing  to  the  efficiency  of  proposed  region  proposal  and  multicue  combination  scheme,  our  tracker  overwhelmingly  exceeds  other  trackers  under  difficult  tracking  conditions,  such  as  outofplane  rotation,  occlusion,  deformation  and  motion  blur.  we  can  tell  from  that  especially  when  faced  with  outofplane  rotation  and  deformation  scenarios  occur,  the  overlap  precision  gains  at  least  comparing  to  other  trackers.  the  reason  is  that  although  the  hog  feature  of  the  object  changes  dramatically  under  outofplane  rotation  and  deformation,  other  features  like  color  histogram  and  texture  stay  unchanged.  the  region  proposal  scheme
__label__situationalsurveillance of  our  approach  can  generate  several  candidates  and  use  color  histogram  to  relocate  the  target.  together  with  the  proposed  criterion  to  sense  the  tracking  status,  rpcf  outperforms  other  trackers  under  difficult  tracking  conditions.  different  tracking  conditions  analysis  of  otb2015.  in  the  paper,  an  object  tracking  system  using  iot  and  edge  computation  is  introduced.  the  proposed  system  focuses  on  the  edge  network  design  and  utilizes  google  cloud  as  the  cloud  iot  core.  specifically,  edgeserver  is  implemented  on  a  xilinx  zynq7000  platform  with  dualcore  arm  and  fpga  artix7.  the  edge  functions  include  capturing  the  images  from  frontend  cameras  and  tracking  interested  objects
__label__situationalsurveillance among  image  sequences,  where  the  tracking  algorithm  plays  a  crucial  rule.  thus,  we  design  an  algorithm  to  keep  a  balance  between  the  tracking  accuracy  and  utility  of  limited  resources  on  edge  devices.  it  achieves  the  stateoftheart  tracking  accuracy,  but  meanwhile,  it  requires  low  computing  capacity  and  memory  space.  in  general,  the  proposed  algorithm  can  proceed  a  1080p  image  in  less  than  25  milliseconds  on  zynq7000  platform  and  rank  in  accuracy  among  traditional  tracking  methods.  besides,  our  method  acquires  comparable  tracking  precision  compared  to  the  cnnbased  trackers  of  model  size  beyond  300  megabytes,  while  our  parameter  size  is  only  157  kilobytes.
__label__situationalsurveillance it  is  three  orders  of  magnitude  less  than  cnnbased  models.  all  in  all,  the  proposed  accurate  tracking  system  enjoys  the  lightweight  computation  and  requires  small  memory  space  therefore  it  has  a  promising  prospect  in  iot  and  edge  computing  applications.  the  algorithm  is  flexibly  deployed  to  many  energyefficient  edge  devices.  the  proposed  tracking  algorithm  plays  as  the  core  of  our  object  tracking  system.  it  maintains  an  ingenious  balance  between  the  tracking  performance,  system  latency  and  energy  consumption.  besides,  the  c  implementation  of  the  overall  algorithm  has  the  advantage  of  easy  and  rapid  deployment.  the  system  is  easily  rearranged  from  google  cloud
__label__situationalsurveillance to  other  iot  platforms  such  as  microsoft  azure  iot  or  amazon  aws  greengrass  software  merely  by  designing  new  interface  programs.  in  the  smart  city  applications,  plenty  of  frontend  cameras  have  been  deployed  for  surveillance,  humancomputer  interaction  and  sports  broadcasting.  our  tracking  system  will  improve  the  existing  systems  by  introducing  tracking  trajectory  of  the  interested  characters.  in  the  future,  selfdriving  cars  with  the  object  tracking  system  will  probably  sense  the  movement  of  surrounding  cars  and  respond  instantly  to  unusual  moves.  although  the  proposed  tracking  system  achieves  the  stateoftheart,  we  argue  that  there  is  still  limitation  existing  in  our  tracking  system.  specifically,
__label__situationalsurveillance it  lies  in  improving  tracking  robustness  for  longtime  object  tracking.  an  issue  exists  that  a  tracker  should  keep  stable  when  occlusion  and  fast  motion  occur;  on  the  contrary,  when  faced  with  deformation  and  rotation  it  should  update  rapidly  to  adapt  the  appearance  changes.  however,  a  reliable  method  to  predict  tracking  status  and  its  corresponding  updating  scheme  still  needs  further  study.  conceptualization,  h.z.  and  z.z.;  methodology,  z.z.;  software,  z.z.  and  l.z.;  validation,  z.z.,  q.k.  and  y.y.;  formal  analysis,  d.s.;  investigation,  h.z.;  resources,  d.s.;  data  curation,  q.k.;  writingoriginal  draft  preparation,  z.z.;  writingreview  and  editing,  d.s.;  visualization,  l.z.;  supervision,  h.z.;  project  administration,  h.z.

__label__situationalsurveillance the  necessary  items  based  on  iot  data  analytics.  with  iot,  employees  will  better  be  able  to  serve  customers  needs.  according  to  the  zebra  2019  shopper  vision  study,  55  of  customers  believe  digitallyequipped  associates  provide  a  better  instore  shopping  experience.  checkout  remains  one  of  the  most  laborintensive  retail  operations  and  an  unpleasant  process  for  customers.  if  a  store  is  overcrowded,  shoppers  often  decide  to  just  leave.  iot  solutions  offer  the  opportunity  to  automate  and  personalize  checkout.  the  improved  checkout  system  can  read  tags  on  each  item  as  customers  leave  and  automatically  charge  the  customers  mobile  payment  app.  this  personalization  can  lead
__label__situationalsurveillance to  increasing  revenue  for  the  store.  according  to  ,  83  of  customers  say  they  would  prefer  if  their  shopping  experience  was  personalized,  while  store  revenues  are  reported  to  increase  by  2030  through  effective  personalization.  iotbased  solutions  offer  actionable  insights  that  enable  new  business  models  for  retailers  and  increase  their  roi.  moving  from  words  to  deeds,  here  are  a  few  examples  of  how  iot  can  capture  new  revenue  opportunities.  an  industry  leader  in  accessible  luxury  handbags,  accessories,  footwear,  and  apparel,  rebecca  minkoff  has  installed  smart  mirrors  in  their  branded  domestic  retail  stores.  smart  mirrors  located  in  fitting  rooms  read  rfid  tags
__label__situationalsurveillance on  each  item  of  clothing  and  display  what  other  sizes  and  colors  are  available.  moreover,  smart  mirrors  demonstrate  how  the  item  can  be  styled  with  different  looks  and  suggest  other  items  based  on  what  a  customer  is  trying  on.  customers  can  simply  try  on  different  clothes  without  leaving  the  fitting  room,  while  retailers  receive  customer  preference  data  to  be  used  for  personal  promotions.  auchan,  an  international  retail  group,  continues  to  bear  fruit  after  implementing  beacons  in  its  hypermarkets  four  years  ago.  customers  visit  more  frequently  and  for  longer,  navigate  the  store  more  easily,  and  receive  deeply  personalized  offers.  auchans  goal
__label__situationalsurveillance was  to  better  understand  how  customers  move  around  its  31,000  m  hypermarkets  and  help  them  more  easily  find  the  products  they  need.  this  was  solved  with  beaconshardware  sensors  that  track  movement  and  transmit  data.  beacons  send  customers  wayfinding  notifications  on  a  special  map  on  their  mobile  devices.  simultaneously,  personalized  promotions  are  offered  as  they  move  through  the  store.  kroger,  the  largest  us  supermarket  chain  by  revenue,  installed  2,200  smart  shelves  in  its  supermarkets.  while  they  appear  to  be  normal  shelves,  theyre  equipped  with  rfid  tags  that  read  items  and  send  the  data  to  an  iot  system.  the  data  can  then
__label__situationalsurveillance be  stored,  formatted,  and  analyzed.  the  retailer  can  use  the  system  to  find  information  about  products  that  run  short,  while  shoppers  can  receive  product  information  when  they  touch  the  shelf  below  an  item.  in  addition,  krogers  smart  shelves  can  be  integrated  with  customers  digital  grocery  lists  so  that  they  light  up  when  an  item  on  the  list  is  nearby.  thus,  rfidequipped  smart  shelves  allow  the  retailer  to  constantly  improve  customer  service  in  real  time.  with  so  many  success  stories  and  benefits  offered  by  iot,  many  retailers  are  still  hesitant  to  invest  in  connected  technology  due  to  some  issues  of  concern
__label__situationalsurveillance and  possible  challenges.  these  will  have  to  be  addressed  in  order  to  completely  and  responsibly  integrate  iot  into  retail  operations.  one  of  iots  key  problems  is  security  and  privacy.  this  has  been  especially  acute  with  the  introduction  of  the  general  data  protection  regulation  gdpr  last  year.  while  access  to  customer  data  gives  retailers  many  opportunities,  at  the  same  time  it  opens  a  door  for  cyberattacks.  retailers  should  closely  collaborate  with  iot  software  developers  to  ensure  that  devices  and  sensors  used  in  retail  are  designed  with  strong  security  mechanisms:  endtoend  encryption,  secure  passwords,  regular  software  updates,  and  an  it  infrastructure  that
__label__situationalsurveillance constantly  scans  for  vulnerabilities.  most  retailers  lack  the  infrastructure  and  networks  to  deal  with  the  huge  volumes  of  iot  data.  in  order  to  make  their  stores  digital,  retail  companies  need  to  make  major  investments  in  robust  networks,  data  centers,  cloud  computing,  and  customerfacing  solutions  like  mpos,  barcode  scanners,  and  tablets.  when  it  comes  to  implementing  a  new  technology,  theres  no  need  to  fund  all  the  infrastructure  aspects  at  once.  retailers  could  start  with  small  changes,  like  using  iot  to  manage  air  conditioning  or  lighting  systems.  this  will  bring  nearterm  roi,  after  which  they  can  implement  more  sophisticated  iot  solutions,  such
__label__situationalsurveillance as  traffic  analytics.  without  question,  retailers  lack  of  relevant  qualifications  makes  timely  and  relevant  a  huge  challenge.  while  retail  employees  are  good  at  commercial  business,  they  simply  dont  possess  the  necessary  technical  skills  to  gain  valuable  insights  from  iot  systems.  retail  companies  can  manage  their  data  by  hiring  their  own  experts,  or  relying  on  third  parties  with  relevant  iot  qualifications,  training,  and  skills.  anticipating  each  of  these  challenges  will  make  retailers  iot  journey  a  profitable  investment,  offering  them  a  competitive  advantage  in  the  marketplace.  i  i  give  my  consent  for  itransition  to  process  my  personal  data  pursuant  to  in  order

__label__situationalsurveillance surveillance  networks  with  other  public  and  private  security  systems,  as  well  as  vehicle  mounted  and  portable  elte  solutions,  to  keep  a  watch  for  incidents  of  theft,  civic  disturbance  and  unauthorised  access.  in  theory,  it  means  zero  blind  spots  in  their  surveillance  network.  in  practice,  it  means  police  forces  can  have  eyes  where  they  didnt  before.  with  smart  devices  allied  to  a  private  broadband  network,  officers  can  pick  up  a  live  feed  of  a  shop  theft  from  cctv,  say,  before  they  even  arrive  at  the  scene,  or  of  criminals  in  flight  from  cameras  fixed  to  patrol  cars  or  drones  in  the
__label__situationalsurveillance vicinity.  huaweis  elte  system  allows  officers  to  swap  incident  details  securely,  and  be  more  agile  in  pursuit.  responses  can  be  coordinated  between  central  command  and  local  patrols,  and  criminals  can  be  brought  to  book  more  easily.  incident  reports  can  be  filed  on  the  spot,  via  a  mobile  app  from  the  same  handheld  device.  it  also  means  police  can  store  and  organise  surveillance  data  in  the  cloud,  and  access,  share  and  query  it  with  greater  ease  and  accuracy.  sophisticated  analytics  tools  improve  their  ability  to  identify,  classify  and  match  stored  video.  importantly,  huawei  says  its  safe  city  solution  is  secure  against
__label__situationalsurveillance cyber  attacks,  and  cost  effective  in  terms  of  new  infrastructure,  especially  when  rolled  out  as  part  of  broader  smart  city  initiatives.  in  nairobi,  kenya,  huawei  has  put  in  place  a  new  communications  network  that  links  1,800  surveillance  cameras  with  195  police  bureaus  and  7,600  police  officers.  the  new  infrastructure,  commissioned  by  president  uhuru  kenyatta,  is  of  strategic  importance  in  terms  of  both  national  and  economic  security.  kenyas  is  the  biggest  economy  in  east  africa,  thanks,  in  part,  to  its  wildlife  and  whitesand  beaches.  tourism  contributes  around  14  per  cent  of  gdp  and  12  per  cent  of  total  employment,  making  it
__label__situationalsurveillance second  only  to  agriculture  in  terms  of  importance.  but  recent  terrorist  strikes  on  its  cities  and  coastal  towns,  as  well  as  the  ongoing  civil  wars  in  neighbouring  somalia  and  sudan,  have  seen  foreign  governments  issue  warnings  to  stop  citizens  travelling  to  kenya.  the  tourist  trade  has  been  undermined  as  a  consequence,  with  repercussions  for  its  wider  economy.  public  security  is  high  on  the  agenda,  clearly.  among  a  number  of  marketing  initiatives  to  revive  interest  among  foreign  travellers,  the  kenyan  government  has  also  invested  in  sophisticated  technology  to  help  tackle  civil  unrest.  kenya  wanted  to  improve  security  conditions,  revive  tourism  and

__label__situationalsurveillance the  ncbi  web  site  requires  javascript  to  function.  the  way  in  which  we  interact  with  our  cars  is  changing,  driven  by  the  increased  use  of  mobile  devices,  cloudbased  services,  and  advanced  automotive  technology.  in  particular,  the  requirements  and  market  demand  for  the  internet  of  things  iot  deviceconnected  vehicles  will  continuously  increase.  in  addition,  the  advances  in  cloud  computing  and  iot  have  provided  a  promising  opportunity  for  developing  vehicular  software  and  services  in  the  automotive  domain.  in  this  paper,  we  introduce  the  concept  of  a  home  iot  connected  vehicle  with  a  voicebased  virtual  personal  assistant  comprised  of  a  vehicle  agent  and
__label__situationalsurveillance a  home  agent.  the  proposed  concept  is  evaluated  by  implementing  a  smartphone  linked  with  home  iot  devices  that  are  connected  to  an  infotainment  system  for  the  vehicle,  a  smartphonebased  natural  language  interface  input  device,  and  cloudbased  home  iot  devices  for  the  home.  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  that  aim  to  reduce  the  inconvenience  due  to  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency  in  iot  environments  are  substantiated  by  analyzing  real  vehicle  testing  and  lifestyle  research.  remarkable  benefits  are  derived  by  making  repetitive  routine  tasks  one  task  that  is  executed  by  a  command  and  by  executing  essential  tasks
__label__situationalsurveillance automatically,  without  any  request.  however,  it  should  be  used  with  authorized  permission,  applied  without  any  error  at  the  right  time,  and  applied  under  limited  conditions  to  sense  the  habitants  intention  correctly  and  to  gain  the  required  trust  regarding  the  remote  execution  of  tasks.  as  emerging  technologies  from  the  consumer  electronics  and  it  technology  fields  crossover  to  the  automotive  domain,  modern  vehicles  are  being  equipped  with  powerful  sensors  and  networking  and  communication  devices  that  can  communicate  with  other  vehicles  and  exchange  information  with  the  external  environment  ,  ,  .  a  connected  vehicle  is  evolving  to  have  devices  that  can  be  connected

__label__situationalsurveillance surround  sensing,  and  can  form  connections  between  vehicles,  as  well  as  between  vehicles  and  surrounding  infrastructure.  this  will  lead  to  increased  requirements  for  information  and  communication  technology,  and  ultimately,  cars  will  become  a  part  of  the  internet  in  the  near  future  .  the  future  mobility  of  the  automotive  industry  requires  new  applications  and  technologies  related  to  electric  powering,  automation,  and  connected  services  .  internetintegrated  vehicles  are  already  on  the  roads,  and  it  is  predicted  that  the  percentage  of  internetintegrated  vehicle  services  will  jump  from  the  current  figure  of  10  to  90  by  2020  .  the  advances  in  cloud  computing  and
__label__situationalsurveillance the  internet  of  things  iot  have  provided  a  promising  opportunity  in  vehicular  software  and  services  in  the  automotive  domain.  academia  and  the  automotive  industry  are  responding  by  exploring  reliable  and  efficient  connectivity  solutions  ,  ,  ,  .  in  recent  years,  the  demand  for  highspeed  mobile  internet  services  has  dramatically  increased;  hence,  the  requirements  and  market  demand  for  iot  deviceconnected  cars  will  continuously  increase.  however,  iotbased  vehicular  data  clouds  must  be  efficient,  scalable,  secure,  and  reliable  before  they  can  be  deployed  on  a  large  scale.  existing  algorithms  and  mechanisms  are  unsatisfactory  to  meet  the  necessary  requirements  simultaneously.  iotbased  vehicular  data  clouds
__label__situationalsurveillance are  expected  to  be  the  backbone  of  the  system,  with  the  goal  of  making  driving  safer  and  more  enjoyable.  however,  research  into  integrating  the  iot  with  vehicular  data  clouds  is  still  in  its  infancy  and  the  existing  study  into  this  topic  is  highly  insufficient.  to  ensure  that  vehicular  data  clouds  are  useful,  numerous  services  such  as  road  navigation,  traffic  management,  remote  monitoring,  urban  surveillance,  information,  entertainment,  and  business  intelligence  need  to  be  developed  and  deployed  based  on  vehicular  data  clouds  ,  ,  ,  ,  .  numerous  challenges  still  exist  such  as  security,  privacy,  scalability,  reliability,  quality  of  service,  and  the
__label__situationalsurveillance lack  of  global  standards  ,  .  due  to  the  complexity  involved  in  implementing  vehicular  clouds  and  integrating  various  devices  and  systems  with  vehicular  clouds,  a  systematic  approach  and  collaboration  among  academia,  the  automobile  companies,  law  enforcement,  government  authorities,  standardization  groups,  and  cloud  service  providers  is  needed  to  address  these  challenges.  though  there  are  many  challenges,  iot  and  cloud  computing  provide  tremendous  opportunities  for  technology  innovation  in  the  automobile  industry  and  will  serve  as  enabling  infrastructures  for  developing  vehicular  data  clouds  .  one  of  the  most  important  applications  of  iot  technology  is  the  development  of  smart  homes,  smart  offices,  smart  cars,
__label__situationalsurveillance etc.,  in  a  smart  environment  domain  ,  ,  ,  ,  .  smart  home  environments  are  becoming  a  part  of  our  everyday  life  where  different  devices  and  technologies  are  deployed.  in  particular,  the  smart  home  application,  which  has  recently  gained  more  popularity,  includes  a  set  of  connected  sensors,  appliances,  and  gadgets  that  can  be  used  to  control  and  monitor  various  household  characteristics  such  as  heating,  lighting,  and  security  ,  .  there  are  two  immediate  driving  forces  bringing  iot  connectivity  to  vehicles.  one  is  for  the  connected  vehicle  to  communicate,  via  the  mobile  network,  with  the  connected  house,  and  the  other  is
__label__situationalsurveillance to  adjust  any  connected  devices  in  the  home  remotely.  the  mobile  network  plays  a  significant  role  in  reliably  and  securely  transferring  relevant  data  from  the  vehicle  to  the  house.  the  iot  technology  enables  linking  physical  objects,  such  as  different  devices  and  sensors,  with  virtual  objects,  which  exist  through  internet  connections,  with  increased  comfort  and  safety.  a  seamless  communication  from  the  home  to  vehicle  and  to  other  parts  of  life  is  now  expected.  this  is  leading  to  smartphone  connectivity  with  the  vehicle  and  the  connectivity  of  the  vehicle  with  the  cloud,  etc.  however,  limitations  exist  regarding  the  evolution  of  cellular  connectivity
__label__situationalsurveillance once  the  necessary  components  are  embedded  in  the  vehicle  .  nowadays,  there  is  a  growing  demand  for  continuous  access  to  the  internet  in  vehicles  to  provide  improved  safety,  comfort,  mobility,  and  entertainment.  as  more  people  spend  a  considerable  part  of  their  lives  in  their  vehicles,  drivers  will  increasingly  demand  access  to  applications  such  as  google  maps  and  youtube  using  the  familiar  interfaces  in  their  car  .  additionally,  as  mobile  devices  continue  to  grow  in  usage,  people  are  creating  secondary  interface  experiences  related  to,  but  not  necessarily  attached  to,  their  vehicles,  making  this  type  of  device  a  prime  choice  for  any
__label__situationalsurveillance vehicular  application.  moreover,  they  expect  to  have  the  same  connectivity  in  their  vehicles  as  they  have  at  home  and  at  work.  therefore,  future  automotive  it  infrastructure  and  interaction  specifications  should  follow  on  from  general  humancomputer  interaction  guidelines  with  the  understanding  that  there  will  be  a  high  heterogeneity  required  to  manage  these  contexts  .  even  when  end  users  can  communicate  with  the  iot  via  multiple  modalities,  one  of  the  most  common  ways  to  interact  with  electronic  devices  is  through  a  graphical  user  interface  gui.  however,  graphical  interfaces  can  be  confusing  and  difficult  to  use  when  users  employ  different  interfaces  in  several
__label__situationalsurveillance environments.  as  the  main  modality  that  humans  use  to  communicate  with  each  other,  speech  can  be  one  of  the  most  convenient  means  of  interaction.  in  terms  of  vehicle  safety  ,  the  user  interface  is  designed  with  connectivity  in  mind,  significantly  enhancing  the  possibilities  of  such  technologies  as  speech  synthesis  and  speech  recognition  ,  .  a  recent  advance  in  speech  recognition  is  the  adaptation  of  natural  language  understanding  technology,  thereby  improving  the  efficiency  of  humancomputer  interactions  .  speech  interfaces  are  attracting  more  attention,  and  therefore,  speech  recognition  technology  is  becoming  an  integral  part  of  interacting  with  iot  devices.  in  the  near
__label__situationalsurveillance future,  speech  interface  technology  will  enable  the  end  users  to  naturally  speak  to  their  household  devices  instead  of  pushing  the  buttons  or  clicking  the  icons  on  a  gui.  vehicles  have  become  a  sophisticated  and  pivotal  piece  of  the  iot  and  have  always  been  an  extension  of  us,  integrated  into  our  lifestyles  and  daily  tasks  as  a  reflection  of  our  human  experience.  thanks  to  internet  technologies,  the  vehicle  is  able  to  interact  with  other  connected  ecosystems  such  as  the  smart  home,  providing  seamless  mobility  .  drivers  increasingly  want  to  stay  connected  to  their  homes  while  driving  and  enable  seamless  home  automation
__label__situationalsurveillance links  to  internetenabled  smart  devices,  such  as  lights,  home  security  systems,  automatic  garage  doors,  and  more.  they  want  to  experience  an  interaction  to  open  a  garage  door  and  to  turn  on  a  light  on  the  dashboard  of  their  vehicles  or  through  voice  control  when  they  are  a  certain  distance  from  home.  our  research  is  conducted  to  illustrate  the  need  of  vehicletohome  connectivity  and  to  demonstrate  it  by  providing  drivers  with  a  convenient  and  responsible  way  to  remotely  access  all  of  their  most  frequently  used  smart  home  devices  while  on  the  road.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  the  concept  of  a
__label__situationalsurveillance home  iot  connected  vehicle,  which  is  a  vehicle  connected  to  the  home  as  a  part  of  the  iot  ecosystem.  it  has  a  voicebased  virtual  personal  assistant  comprised  of  a  vehicle  agent  and  a  home  agent,  and  always  stays  with  a  driver  as  a  personal  iot  partner  to  perform  several  kinds  of  activities  while  driving,  at  home,  and  at  the  office.  it  is  implemented  by  merging  an  invehicle  infotainment  system  and  a  cloudbased  smart  home  platform.  for  the  vehicle,  the  invehicle  infotainment  system,  in  which  a  smartphone  is  linked  and  the  cloudbased  smart  home  server  and  natural  language  processing  server  are
__label__situationalsurveillance connected,  is  developed  and  integrated  into  the  vehicle.  for  the  home,  a  smartphonebased  natural  language  interface  input  device  includes  an  androidbased  smartphone  and  nearfield  noisecanceling  microphone.  it  connects  the  same  cloudbased  smart  home  server  and  natural  language  processing  server,  providing  the  same  services  for  the  vehicle.  the  proposed  concept  is  substantiated  by  analyzing  real  vehicle  testing  and  lifestyle  research  through  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios;  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  presents  the  proof  of  concept  for  the  home  iotconnected  vehicle,  and  describes  how  to  design  the
__label__situationalsurveillance home  iotconnected  vehicle.  provides  four  categorized  groups  of  hometovehicle  connected  services,  and  provides  the  evaluation  results.  finally,  concludes  the  proposed  proof  of  concept.  the  proposed  concept  is  a  home  iot  connected  vehicle  with  a  voicebased  virtual  personal  assistant  and  it  is  made  up  of  a  vehicle  agent  and  a  home  agent,  as  shown  in  .  the  virtual  personal  assistant  always  stays  with  a  driver  as  a  personal  iot  partner  and  performs  several  kinds  of  activities  to  be  able  to  do  things  like  turn  on  the  a/c,  lock/unlock  the  doors,  and  turn  on  lights,  as  well  as  to  support  functions  like

__label__situationalsurveillance and  controlled  for  both  the  vehicle  and  home  environments,  utilizing  a  homogeneous  speech  interface.  along  with  an  increasing  number  of  digital  appliances  in  the  smart  home  space,  complex  control  or  management,  including  numerous  data  storage  systems,  is  becoming  a  heavy  burden  on  the  smart  home  system  .  home  devices  connected  to  smart  home  server.  cloud  computing  represents  an  ondemand  service  model  for  delivering  resources  ranging  from  storage  and  data  access  via  computation  to  software  provisioning,  so  it  becomes  an  ideal  alternative.  thus,  we  consider  that  the  smart  home  can  merge  into  the  cloud  to  provide  more  services  and  obtain  more
__label__situationalsurveillance information  provided  by  the  cloud.  zigbee  and  wifi  wireless  home  automation  technology  are  being  adopted  to  modify  existing  housing.  the  coexistence  of  wireless  technologies  in  iot  wifi,  zigbee,  bluetooth,  and  bluetooth  low  energy  is  considered  for  an  indoor  environment  ,  ,  ,  .  as  the  number  of  devices  increases,  the  possibility  of  interference  in  a  home  environment  also  increases.  interference  in  a  home  environment  is  a  result  of  devices  using  different  technologies  for  communication.  therefore,  different  types  of  gateways  are  used  to  connect  different  technologies  within  the  home  to  provide  access  from  the  home  to  external  services  and  vice  versa.
__label__situationalsurveillance as  the  groupedcontrolled  iot  devices  for  this  study,  12  roll  shades  and  eight  smart  bulbs  are  used.  the  roll  shade  device  uses  the  zwave  communication  protocol  and  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  a  zwave  gateway  device  with  an  ethernet  interface.  the  smart  bulb  device  has  the  zigbee  communication  protocol  and  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  the  zigbee  gateway  device  with  a  wifi  interface.  we  have  applied  smart  bulb  devices  as  the  lighting  sources  for  a  living  room,  a  dining  room,  and  a  kitchen.  the  smart  thinq  sensor  is  used  to  detect  the  status  of  the  washer
__label__situationalsurveillance and  dryer  using  another  zigbee  communication  device  .  the  device  detects  the  vibration  of  the  washer  and  dryer  and  can  distinguish  the  end  of  the  operation.  in  addition,  a  refrigerator,  an  air  conditioner,  a  robot  cleaner,  and  two  multiroom  speakers  are  used  as  wifi  communication  devices  .  a  motorized  garage  door  opener  and  an  ultrasonic  sensor,  which  can  detect  the  parking  distance  when  a  car  enters  the  parking  lot  and  drives  to  a  reserved  parking  space,  are  used  for  automated  parking  control.  for  the  parking  distance  detection  sensor,  two  ultrasonic  sensors  are  used.  if  a  vehicle  is  correctly  parked  in
__label__situationalsurveillance the  parking  lot,  the  light  shows  a  green  color;  otherwise,  the  light  shows  a  red  color.  moreover,  the  status  of  the  sensor  is  transferred  to  a  cloud  platform  and  used  to  automatically  open  the  back  door  located  in  the  parking  lot.  the  proposed  concept  is  substantiated  through  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios,  which  are  described  in  ,  ,  and  :  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  it  is  suggested,  as  a  means  for  the  driver,  for  users  to  make  use  of  the  iot  in  their  daily  living.  we  use  both  the  lifestyle  research
__label__situationalsurveillance method  and  the  real  vehicle  testing  method  to  prove  the  concept  and  to  ensure  that  our  study  is  as  realistic  as  possible.  we  assume  that  the  driver  is  a  commuter  and  periodically  visits  several  locations  since  it  is  quite  easy  to  find  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns,  both  before  starting  to  drive  and  after  driving.  the  possible  service  scenarios  of  a  driver  making  use  of  the  iot  in  their  daily  living  are  suggested  as  primary  and  are  designed  to  reduce  the  inconvenience  of  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency.  it  uses  the  vehicular  data  cloud  in  an  iot
__label__situationalsurveillance environment  that  has  the  capability  to  integrate  numerous  devices  available  within  the  home  and  devices  in  the  vehicle.  therefore,  we  focus  on  how  cloud  services  could  be  effectively  utilized  for  the  real  lifestyle  when  an  end  user  rides  in  a  vehicle  with  devices  connected  through  the  iot.  scenario  for  an  individual  on  the  way  home.  scenario  for  arriving  at  home.  scenario  for  living  at  home.  scenario  for  leaving  home.  the  first  scenario  is  the  way  to  home.  in  this  scenario,  the  smartphone  is  placed  on  the  wireless  charger  and  the  welcome  message  is  automatically  shown  whenever  the  driver  gets  into
__label__situationalsurveillance the  vehicle.  when  a  driver  is  near  his  or  her  vehicle,  the  door  unlocks  and  is  automatically  opened.  moreover,  the  status  information  will  be  sent  to  the  iot  cloud.  it  is  important  to  note  that  these  sensors  can  be  freely  placed  all  around  the  doors  and  doorjambs  since  they  are  relatively  inexpensive.  we  believe  that  they  will  be  triggered  by  an  input  from  the  pressure  or  force  sensors  or  other  types  of  sensors  around  the  doors  and  doorjambs.  a  hypothetical  scenario  could  be  the  enabling  and  integration  of  wireless  sensor  networks  and  the  iot  environment.  the  cloudbased  smart  home  platform
__label__situationalsurveillance can  then  determine  the  time  to  transmit  every  control  command.  the  second  scenario  is  for  arriving  at  home.  as  a  driver  arrives  home,  the  vehicle  receives  the  gps  information  and  the  voice  message  is  given  to  the  driver  to  trigger  the  garage  door  opener  remotely.  when  the  driver  gives  the  voicebased  command,  while  in  the  vehicle,  the  garage  door  is  opened  remotely  and  automatically.  when  the  vehicle  is  detected  after  entering  into  the  garage,  the  garage  door  is  closed  automatically  by  the  command  from  the  smart  home  server.  this  action  is  triggered  by  the  parking  distance  detection  sensor.  the  use
__label__situationalsurveillance of  parking  distance  sensing  with  two  ultrasonic  sensors  is  designed  to  detect  when  the  vehicle  enters  the  parking  lot  and  heads  to  the  correct  reserved  parking  space.  when  the  vehicle  is  parked  in  the  given  space,  the  smart  home  server  automatically  transmits  a  command  to  open  the  backdoor  lock  located  inside  the  garage.  the  third  scenario  is  for  living  at  home.  this  scenario  assumes  that  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns  are  conducted  automatically  to  minimize  routine  tasks.  sequential  commands  from  the  cloudbased  smart  home  server  are  given  to  turn  on  the  lights,  play  music  from  multiroom  speakers,  and  open  the  grouped  12
__label__situationalsurveillance roll  shades.  the  scenario  assumes  that  the  roll  shades  are  initially  closed,  and  the  lights  are  dimmed  prior  to  detecting  any  illumination  changes.  all  types  of  iot  devices  are  controlled  when  voice  commands  are  received  from  the  habitant.  room  illumination  controllers  were  deployed  in  an  actual  house  using  smart  bulbs.  in  addition,  seamless  music  playing  was  conducted  by  multiroom  speakers.  the  refrigerator  and  air  conditioner  could  also  be  controlled  using  the  temperature  information  provided  by  the  nest  built  in  the  house.  the  last  scenario  is  for  leaving  home.  this  scenario  assumes  that  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns  are  conducted  when  the  driver
__label__situationalsurveillance or  habitant  leaves  the  home  for  the  same  purpose  of  minimizing  routine  tasks.  the  light  bulbs  and  multiroom  speakers  are  turned  off  and  roll  shades  are  automatically  closed  by  the  opening  of  the  front  door  lock.  this  operation  is  done  after  the  status  of  all  iot  devices  is  checked.  when  the  front  door  lock  is  closed,  the  status  of  the  iot  devices  is  automatically  transferred  to  the  smartphone,  allowing  the  driver  to  verify  the  proper  operation.  in  our  research,  real  vehicle  testing  is  conducted  for  the  way  to  home  and  arriving  at  home  scenarios  and  virtual  home  life  experience  testing
__label__situationalsurveillance is  accompanied  for  the  living  at  home  and  leaving  home  scenarios.  for  vehicle  testing,  a  5  km  driving  route  on  an  urban  road,  which  starts  from  the  office  and  ends  at  home,  is  used  to  validate  the  way  to  home  scenario  and  arriving  at  home  scenario.  the  route  guidance  is  given  from  the  google  navigation  and  the  participants  issue  voice  commands  and  check  the  status  according  to  each  command  while  driving.  for  safety,  participants  are  instructed  to  drive  under  a  speed  of  60  km/h.  a  lot  of  efforts  are  needed  to  enhance  the  performance  of  voice  activation  and  voice  recognition.
__label__situationalsurveillance specially,  a  huge  acoustic  database  collection  is  necessary  and  an  elaborate  training  procedure  is  required  to  support  the  specific  keyword  recognition  by  anyone.  for  home  testing,  it  is  confirmed  that  each  iot  device  works  correctly  and  properly  according  to  the  voice  command  in  standalone.  as  the  next  step,  interoperability  testing  is  performed  through  various  other  wireless  routers.  the  unreliability  issue  of  voice  recognition  exists  according  to  the  distance  between  the  user  and  natural  language  interface  input  device.  it  is  discovered  that  the  recognition  accuracy  needs  to  be  improved.  in  addition,  system  operational  tasks  such  as  new  device  registration,  device  initialization,
__label__situationalsurveillance and  failure  monitoring,  etc.,  need  to  be  tightened  up  to  stabilize  the  smart  home  server.  summarizes  the  evaluation  result  for  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  mentioned  in  .  according  to  the  study,  since  almost  all  of  the  tasks  of  the  first  scenario  to  do  things  like  lock/unlock  the  door,  turn  on  the  a/c,  and  receive  todays  schedule  are  very  routine,  not  so  essential,  and  preferable,  it  is  hard  to  expect  the  greatest  effectiveness  when  it  is  served  automatically  or  controlled  remotely.  above  all,  it  is  insufficient  to  give  simple  information  such  as  the  current  temperature  or  todays  schedule  for  users
__label__situationalsurveillance to  feel  comfortable  and  useful.  more  customized  offerings  need  to  be  provided  to  meet  their  expectation  based  on  the  users  preferred  recommendations.  evaluation  summary.  the  experimental  result  of  the  second  scenario  indicates  that  a  special  benefit  can  be  derived  since  it  makes  repetitive  routine  tasks  one  task,  executed  by  a  command.  when  the  driver  approaches  home,  a  voice  command  for  opening  the  garage  door  is  given  and  it  is  used  as  a  triggering  event  for  the  other  sequential  tasks.  it  is  generated  by  detecting  the  location  of  the  house  and  the  remaining  tasks  of  the  scenario  are  executed  automatically  in
__label__situationalsurveillance the  perfect  order.  the  driver  is  not  forced  to  get  out  of  the  car  and  he  can  open  and  close  the  garage  door  and  open  the  back  door  of  their  house  without  any  action.  it  can  substitute  routine  and  repetitive  works  for  a  human  being.  of  course,  it  needs  to  be  provided  at  an  appropriate  time  and  with  no  fault.  however,  there  is  the  possibility  that  the  current  voice  command  can  be  replaced  with  another  method  and  user  convenience  can  be  maximized  when  iot  devices  are  fully  connected  in  the  near  future.  in  relation  to  the  third  scenario,  we  realize
__label__situationalsurveillance it  is  useful  to  utilize  the  control  command  by  analyzing  the  data  base  acquired  from  the  cloudbased  home  server.  since  it  collects  and  distributes  the  information  from  and  to  the  home  and  vehicles,  it  predicts  personalized  preferences  and  creates  useful  applications  in  various  ways.  in  this  research,  a  limited  number  of  devices  are  integrated  and  the  scenario  is  proposed  to  only  apply  essential  tasks  executed  automatically  without  any  request,  even  if  not  repetitive.  however,  some  scenarios  have  the  capability  to  integrate  numerous  devices,  as  much  as  possible.  for  this  purpose,  it  is  important  that  the  smart  home  platform  is  designed
__label__situationalsurveillance to  allow  for  expansion  in  the  scope  and  service  to  offer  special  and  efficient  home  services  for  different  types  of  digital  appliances.  control  commands  should  be  applied  without  any  error,  at  the  right  time,  and  with  authorized  permission.  otherwise,  users  feel  significant  inconvenience  and  will  no  longer  use  these  services.  in  addition,  since  the  status  of  each  device  can  be  changed  at  any  time  by  anyone,  this  can  cause  a  serious  security  situation  or  issue.  for  example,  a  garage  door  can  be  opened  or  the  music  can  be  played  from  the  multiroom  speaker  in  the  middle  of  the  night.  regarding
__label__situationalsurveillance the  natural  language  interface  for  home  scenarios,  we  also  find  it  is  very  important  to  maximize  the  accuracy  and  precision,  since  a  voice  signals  conversion  into  text  form  depends  on  the  recognition  distance.  the  fourth  scenario  test  results  show  that  it  is  important  to  sense  the  intention  of  habitants  departure  correctly  as  part  of  the  process  of  gaining  trust  for  their  delegating  work.  it  is  assumed  that  there  are  no  remaining  users  in  the  house  and  the  user  goes  out  for  the  purpose  of  being  away  for  a  long  time.  the  status  of  grouped  iot  devices  is  changed  by  the
__label__situationalsurveillance status  transition  of  the  front  door  lock.  it  is  necessary  to  verify  when  control  commands  are  executed  and  the  changed  status  is  transferred  to  habitants.  the  ability  to  receive  the  status  of  iot  devices  remotely  makes  the  user  feel  secure,  even  if  they  do  not  check  the  status  of  the  home  in  advance  before  leaving.  this  is  adapted  in  reality  when  the  user  does  not  have  enough  time  to  check  the  status  or  forgets  to  check  it.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  the  concept  of  a  home  iot  connected  vehicle  with  a  voicebased  virtual  personal  assistant.  the  virtual  personal  assistant
__label__situationalsurveillance stays  with  a  driver  to  consistently  assist  while  driving,  at  home,  at  the  office,  or  while  running  errands.  the  system  provides  a  communication  channel  between  the  user  and  the  virtual  personal  assistant  using  a  homogeneous  voicebased  natural  language  interface,  both  in  the  vehicle  and  at  home.  the  proposed  concept  was  evaluated  by  implementing  a  linked  smartphone  and  home  iot  devices  that  were  connected  to  a  vehicles  infotainment  system.  in  addition,  a  smartphonebased  natural  language  interface  input  device  and  cloudbased  home  iot  devices  for  the  home  were  utilized.  several  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  were  substantiated  with  the  aim  of  reducing  the
__label__situationalsurveillance inconvenience  of  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency  in  an  iot  environment  by  performing  real  vehicle  testing  and  lifestyle  research.  the  scenarios  included  the  following:  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  this  study  shows  that  it  is  insufficient  to  provide  only  simple  information  such  as  the  current  temperature  or  todays  schedule.  a  remarkable  benefit  is  derived  by  combining  sequentially  repetitive  routine  tasks  into  one  task  or  by  executing  essential  tasks  automatically,  without  any  request.  however,  the  automatic  execution  of  tasks  should  be  used  with  authorized  permission,  applied  without  any
__label__situationalsurveillance error  only  at  certain  fixed  times,  and  applied  under  limited  conditions  to  sense  habitants  status  correctly.  this  will  allow  the  habitants  to  gain  trust  regarding  the  remote  execution  of  tasks.  future  work  may  include  more  comprehensive  study  in  relation  to  driving  safety  and  vehicle  security.  the  connected  car  will  be  more  entertaining,  more  efficient  than  traditional  cars,  and  an  advanced  it  technology  such  as  iot  will  provide  new  functionalities,  including  the  hometovehicle  connected  services  proposed  in  this  research.  however,  it  will  inevitably  increase  the  drivers  invehicle  interactions  and  decrease  their  attention  whilst  driving,  potentially  causing  additional  driver  distraction  while  driving.

__label__situationalsurveillance to  enhance  competitiveness,  smooth  traffic  conditions  are  of  the  utmost  importance  for  any  city.  this  is  especially  true  when  developing  a  smart  city,  which  aims  at  making  good  use  of  information  and  communication  technologies  ict  to  support  the  creation  of  a  ubiquitous  and  interconnected  network  of  citizens  and  organizations,  sharing  digital  data  and  information  via  the  internet  of  things  iot  .  in  recent  years,  smart  mobility  and  smart  transportation  have  been  advocated  to  alleviate  the  above  social  and  public  problems.  in  general,  frequent  roadside  loading  and  unloading  activities  have  a  negative  impact  on  traffic  situations.  an  increasing  number  of  vehicles

__label__situationalsurveillance unnecessary  blocking  and  create  safety  issues  for  other  road  users,  and  traffic  flow  can  be  affected.  hence,  there  are  increasing  numbers  of  applications  for  roadside  surveillance  systems,  especially  with  respect  to  traffic  surveillance  related  to  increasing  traffic  congestion.  however,  current  roadside  surveillance  systems  have  limitations,  such  as  being  affected  by  vehicle  speeds  .  to  be  useful,  a  roadside  surveillance  system  requires  machine  learning  and  computer  visionbased  technology  to  facilitate  and  enhance  the  accuracy  and  effectiveness  of  detection  and  recognition  of  vehicles  and  objects  .  with  an  increasing  number  of  vehicles  in  roadside  situations  which  may  cause  severe  traffic  congestion,  a
__label__situationalsurveillance suitable  and  wellfunctioning  system  is  needed,  utilizing  ict  and  iot  technologies.  this  would  enable  surveillance  of  roadside  loading  and  unloading  bays,  to  prevent  traffic  congestion  and  facilitate  traffic  and  fleet  planning  and  management  by  implementing  smart  mobility,  hence  achieving  a  highly  efficient  road  network  in  a  smart  city.  furthermore,  smart  transportation  and  smart  parking  can  be  established  under  the  ontology  of  smart  mobility.  onsite  roadside  example  of  doubleparking.  in  an  attempt  to  solve  these  problems,  this  paper  presents  an  iotbased  system  for  the  surveillance  of  roadside  loading  and  unloading  bays,  namely,  a  computer  visionbased  roadside  occupation  surveillance  system  cvross.  by

__label__situationalsurveillance and  discusses  the  findings,  together  with  their  implications.  finally,  conclusions  are  drawn  in  .  in  this  section,  an  overview  of  roadside  surveillance  systems  is  given.  the  methods  and  emerging  iot  technologies  used  in  roadside  surveillance  systems  are  then  discussed,  to  define  the  research  gap  addressed  by  this  paper.  with  the  advancement  of  technology,  roadside  surveillance  systems  have  developed  significantly  in  terms  of  object  detection,  tracking,  classification  and  behaviour  analysis,  thus  improving  accuracy  and  reliability.  surveillance  refers  to  the  processes  of  focusing  systematic  and  routine  attention  on  certain  human  behaviours  for  influencing,  managing,  protecting  or  directing  purposes  .  this  may  entail
__label__situationalsurveillance observation  from  a  distance  by  means  of  electronic  equipment,  such  as  closedcircuit  television  cameras  cctv  or  interception  of  electronically  transmitted  information,  such  as  internet  traffic  or  phone  calls.  surveillance  is  frequently  utilized  by  governments  for  intelligence  gathering,  crime  prevention  and  investigation,  or  for  the  protection  of  a  process,  person,  group  or  object.  for  example,  traffic  surveillance  by  video  cameras  is  common,  using  cameras  installed  in  many  different  locations,  e.g.,  mounted  along  the  highways  to  monitor  realtime  traffic  situations,  thus  controlling  traffic  flow  and  facilitating  traffic  management  by  governments.  according  to  valera  and  velastin  ,  roadside  surveillance  systems  are  utilized  to
__label__situationalsurveillance observe  the  roadside  activities  and  behaviours  of  vehicles  and  road  users,  and  they  include  moving  object  detection,  recognition,  classification,  tracking,  behavioural  analysis  and  retrieval.  this  enables  realtime  monitoring  of  persistent  and  transient  objects  within  a  specific  environment.  by  applying  advanced  information  and  communication  technologies,  roadside  surveillance  systems  are  able  to  solve  transport  problems  such  as  road  hazards  and  traffic  congestion  and,  ultimately,  they  can  help  to  achieve  transport  efficiency  .  smooth  traffic  conditions  are  crucial  to  road  users  and  the  public,  and  traffic  congestion  can  lead  to  a  range  of  negative  effects.  according  to  robinson  ,  traffic  congestion  is  very
__label__situationalsurveillance costly  and  has  an  obvious  negative  effect  on  productivity,  fuel  consumption,  environmental  quality  and  quality  of  human  life.  the  effects  of  traffic  congestion  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  delays  in  journeys,  increasing  air  pollution  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions,  blocking  of  emergency  vehicles  and  spillover  effects  from  congested  roads  to  other  roads.  for  instance,  traffic  congestion  may  delay  the  schedules  of  truck  drivers  loading  and  unloading  activities,  thus  affecting  the  management  of  logistics  companies.  some  vehicles  even  circle  the  road  network  to  wait  for  available  parking  spaces.  this  wastes  fuel  and  energy.  therefore,  the  ultimate  objective  of  roadside  surveillance  systems
__label__situationalsurveillance is  to  facilitate  traffic  and  fleet  management,  since  traffic  congestion,  accidents  and  low  traffic  efficiency  result  in  a  waste  of  resources  .  video  surveillance  has  drawn  the  attention  of  scientists  and  engineers  to  active  applicationoriented  research  on  computer  vision,  artificial  intelligence  and  image  processing.  this  is  a  contributing  factor  in  the  increasingly  widespread  deployment  of  intelligent  videobased  surveillance  systems  .  one  of  the  most  significant  applications  of  intelligent  videobased  surveillance  systems,  in  which  a  growing  interest  has  emerged  in  recent  years,  is  roadside  traffic  surveillance  for  dealing  with  problems  of  increasing  traffic  congestion.  current  techniques  include  vehicle  detection  and  tracking
__label__situationalsurveillance to  measure  traffic  parameters  and  car  park  management.  traffic  conditions  are  of  crucial  importance  for  road  users  and  society  generally.  thus,  various  applications  of  roadside  surveillance  systems  aim  at  utilizing  image  processing  methods  to  obtain  better  traffic  conditions  and  maintain  a  high  level  of  road  safety,  thus  achieving  a  more  efficient  traffic  network  .  the  development  of  roadside  surveillance  systems  for  the  measurement  of  traffic  parameters  has  been  a  focus  of  research  in  recent  years.  data  on  the  number  of  vehicles  and  their  type,  speed  and  flow,  are  collected  by  roadside  surveillance  systems  using  vehicle  detection  and  tracking  techniques.  this
__label__situationalsurveillance contributes  to  transportation  planning,  traffic  operation  and  pavement  design.  according  to  huang  ,  roadside  cameras  have  been  applied  to  estimate  lane  boundaries  and  vanishing  points,  hence  classifying  vehicles  by  their  physical  length,  to  monitor  traffic  situations  on  the  roads  via  video  image  processing  techniques.  in  addition,  coifman  et  al.  designed  a  realtime  computer  vision  system  for  vehicle  tracking  and  traffic  surveillance  by  considering  the  lighting  conditions  in  daylight  and  twilight  and  at  night.  saran  and  sreelekha  also  utilized  a  videobased  surveillance  system  to  measure  traffic  parameters.  the  system  used  could  be  divided  into  three  main  functions:  detection,  classification  and  tracing
__label__situationalsurveillance of  vehicles.  this  also  enabled  the  number  of  vehicles  to  be  counted.  to  provide  realtime  analytical  information,  computer  vision  techniques  were  used  to  process  images.  with  the  traffic  information  produced  traffic  congestion,  number  of  vehicles,  classification,  etc.,  the  videobased  surveillance  system  was  expected  to  achieve  and  maintain  efficient  traffic  management  and  road  safety.  by  considering  traffic  conditions,  related  applications  mainly  focus  on  vehicle  detection  and  tracking,  processing  the  data  and  images  using  computing  techniques.  hence,  useful  information  about  traffic  parameters  can  be  produced  for  further  analysis,  transportation  planning,  traffic  operation  and  pavement  design.  in  addition  to  the  measurement  of  traffic
__label__situationalsurveillance parameters,  the  number  of  applications  of  surveillance  systems  for  facilitating  the  management  of  both  indoor  and  outdoor  car  parks  is  increasing.  in  this  type  of  application,  systems  are  mainly  used  for  counting  the  number  of  parked  vehicles,  monitoring  changes  in  parked  vehicles  over  time  and  identifying  available  parking  spaces  .  searching  for  parking  spaces  consumes  a  significant  amount  of  travelling  time,  regardless  of  whether  it  is  in  a  car  park  or  on  the  roadside.  moreover,  there  is  always  a  difficulty  in  maintaining  and  providing  information  in  real  time  without  using  an  intelligent  system.  therefore,  in  recent  years,  many  researchers  have
__label__situationalsurveillance studied  the  possibility  of  using  visionbased  car  park  management  systems  to  determine  occupancy  and  vacancy  and  to  provide  users  with  related  information.  lin  et  al.  proposed  a  visionbased  parking  management  system  to  manage  an  outdoor  car  park,  using  four  cameras  set  up  in  the  lofts  of  surrounding  buildings  to  record  occupancy  and  vacancy,  then  processing  the  data  and  transferring  the  information  to  users.  greyscale  images  were  captured  to  maintain  colour  consistency  and  increase  the  accuracy  of  the  system.  furthermore,  micheloni  et  al.  utilized  a  surveillance  system  for  car  parks  by  managing  both  static  and  active  cameras  in  a  hierarchical  framework.
__label__situationalsurveillance the  static  camera  system  employed  a  variable  number  of  static  sensors  to  maintain  the  trace  of  all  objects  simultaneously,  while  the  active  camera  system  used  a  pantilt  camera  to  capture  high  definition  hd  video  of  the  target,  to  prevent  problems  with  multisensor,  multitarget  tracking.  these  surveillance  systems  applied  to  car  park  management  are  beneficial  for  counting  the  number  of  parked  vehicles,  monitoring  changes  in  the  parked  vehicles  over  time  and  identifying  available  parking  spaces.  they  are  also  likely  to  be  applicable  to  roadside  loading  and  unloading  bays  for  locating  occupancy  and  vacancy,  thus  alleviating  the  problem  addressed  in  this  paper.
__label__situationalsurveillance following  recent  advances  in  technology,  roadside  surveillance  is  not  only  based  on  cameras  but  also  on  other  emerging  technologies,  aimed  at  achieving  various  aims  and  objectives.  researchers  have  been  most  interested  in  the  development  and  applications  of  radio  tomographic  imaging  rti,  wireless  sensor  networks  wsns  and  computer  vision  for  roadside  surveillance.  radio  tomographic  imaging  is  an  emerging  technology  that  localizes  and  tracks  moving  physical  objects  in  an  area  surrounded  by  simple  and  inexpensive  radios  in  wireless  networks  .  the  concept  of  rti  originates  from  radar  systems.  using  concepts  from  radar,  rti  originally  worked  by  placing  small  and  inexpensive  radios  around
__label__situationalsurveillance the  area  of  interest.  the  radios  were  able  to  transmit  and  receive  wireless  signals,  creating  a  dense  network  of  links  passing  through  the  area.  if  an  object  moved  within  the  area,  it  would  reflect  or  absorb  the  wireless  signal  and  prevent  some  of  the  power  from  reaching  its  destination.  hence,  an  image  could  be  formed  of  where  the  power  was  being  absorbed,  by  utilizing  the  links  powerloss  measurements.  therefore,  it  could  indicate  the  locations  of  any  detected  and  tracked  objects.  more  recently,  rti  has  been  proposed  for  tracking  the  location  of  objects  via  radio  waves,  without  requiring  objects  to  transmit
__label__situationalsurveillance or  receive  radio  signals.  this  occurs  when  the  position  is  extracted  by  inferring  which  voxels  are  obstructing  a  subset  of  radio  links  in  a  dense  wireless  sensor  network  .  anderson  et  al.  demonstrated  a  novel  application  of  rti  with  a  secure  wireless  sensor  network  for  roadside  surveillance  and  vehicle  identification  and  tracking,  by  combining  frames  of  a  moving  vehicle  into  a  single  image  using  a  vehicle  classidentification  algorithm.  however,  the  technology  of  rti  is  subject  to  the  speed  at  which  it  can  detect  objects  moving  through  the  network  .  speed  is  limited  by  the  time  it  takes  to  perform  a
__label__situationalsurveillance single  scan  of  the  network  area.  vehicles  on  roads  are  not  always  static.  if  some  vehicles  are  travelling  at  high  speeds  which  are  out  of  the  system  specification  range,  rti  might  not  record  anything,  thus  affecting  the  process  of  measuring  traffic  parameters.  thus,  rti  is  not  totally  suitable  for  allround  roadside  surveillance;  only  for  object  detection  and  tracking  at  relatively  low  speeds.  wsns  use  networked  microsensor  technology,  which  is  one  of  the  most  important  technologies  of  the  21st  century  and  a  key  technology  for  the  future  .  wireless  sensor  networks  offer  an  attractive,  lowcost  alternative  to  inductive  loops,  video  and
__label__situationalsurveillance radar,  for  traffic  surveillance  on  freeways,  at  intersections  and  in  car  parks.  according  to  cheung  et  al.  ,  these  networks  typically  consist  of  a  set  of  sensor  nodes  comprising  a  sensor,  a  microprocessor,  a  radio,  a  battery  and  an  access  point,  together  with  a  radio  and  a  more  powerful  processor.  the  sensor  nodes  are  utilized  to  process  realtime  measurements  and  transmit  useful  data  to  the  access  point  located  at  the  roadside,  through  direct  communication  via  either  line  or  solar  power.  this  then  enables  the  detection  of  vehicles  and  the  estimation  of  various  traffic  parameters.  cheung  and  varaiya  utilized  a  network
__label__situationalsurveillance of  small  sensor  nodes,  communicating  wirelessly  among  themselves,  to  sense  the  physical  world.  after  the  collection  of  data  from  the  detection  events  using  the  sensor  nodes,  the  access  point  could  calculate  the  number,  occupancy  and  speed  of  monitored  traffic.  it  is  evident,  therefore,  that  wsns  offer  an  attractive,  lowcost  alternative  to  inductive  loops,  video  and  radar,  for  traffic  surveillance.  however,  tiwari  et  al.  have  argued  that  wsns  are  easily  affected  by  their  surroundings,  e.g.,  by  walls,  microwaves  or  signal  attenuation  due  to  large  distances.  these  networks  also  have  a  comparatively  low  speed  of  communication  with  the  server  and  are  easily
__label__situationalsurveillance disrupted  by  elements  such  as  bluetooth.  due  to  the  instability  of  communication  and  concerns  about  interruption,  wsns  may  not  be  appropriate  for  providing  road  users  and  the  public  with  accurate  traffic  data  and  information.  furthermore,  technological  improvement  has  led  to  the  development  of  semiautomatic  systems  known  as  computer  vision  for  creating  algorithms  by  using  computers  for  automatic  realtime  object  and  event  detection  and  to  aid  recognition  .  according  to  huang  ,  from  an  engineering  perspective,  computer  vision  aims  at  building  autonomous  systems  and  seeks  to  automate,  with  greater  efficiency,  tasks  that  are  performed  by  the  human  visual  system.  in  fact,
__label__situationalsurveillance several  monitoring  objectives  can  be  supported  by  the  application  of  computer  vision  and  pattern  recognition  techniques,  such  as  detection  of  traffic  violations  and  identification  of  road  users  .  beymer  et  al.  presented  a  featurebased  tracking  approach  for  the  task  of  tracking  vehicles  during  periods  of  traffic  congestion.  video  cameras  were  expected  to  be  mounted  on  poles  or  other  tall  structures  looking  down  at  the  traffic  scene.  huang  and  yen  designed  a  realtime  and  colourbased  computer  vision  system  for  traffic  monitoring,  by  analysing  colour  image  sequences  of  traffic  scenes  recorded  by  mounting  a  stationary  camera  on  a  tall  building  or  a
__label__situationalsurveillance pedestrian  crossing  bridge  near  a  traffic  light.  although  computer  visionbased  surveillance  systems  have  various  functionalities,  such  as  vehicle  detection,  recognition  and  classification,  the  systems  require  relatively  long  processing  times  and  considerable  memory,  since  converting  collected  data  into  useful  information  can  be  challenging.  in  addition,  the  setup  for  camera  calibration  to  facilitate  the  extraction  of  the  required  images  is  difficult  and  timeconsuming  .  however,  according  to  zander  et  al.  ,  machine  learning  can  be  applied  to  enhance  the  accuracy  and  efficiency  of  detection  and  recognition  of  an  object,  using  computer  visionbased  surveillance  systems.  thus,  systems  are  able  to  learn  without  being
__label__situationalsurveillance explicitly  programmed,  by  exploring  the  construction  of  algorithms.  this  facilitates  more  efficient  calculation  and  measurement  of  realtime  information  on  roadside  activities,  occupancy,  vacancy  and  traffic  parameters.  in  summary,  an  effective  roadside  surveillance  system  is  critical  for  maintaining  road  safety,  alleviating  traffic  congestion  and  facilitating  traffic  and  fleet  management.  applications  for  the  measurement  of  traffic  parameters  and  car  park  management  utilizing  computer  vision,  show  an  increasing  trend.  computer  vision  technology  can  be  powerful  when  properly  matched  with  machine  learning  and  big  data  analysis,  outweighing  the  disadvantage  of  long  processing  times.  in  addition,  this  can  lead  to  better  analysis,  with  a  high
__label__situationalsurveillance level  of  accuracy  and  efficiency  .  furthermore,  improvements  in  camera  calibration  should  be  considered  when  utilizing  computer  vision,  to  maintain  the  accuracy,  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  systems  and  to  account  for  various  features  on  different  roads,  such  as  the  surroundings  and  the  amount  of  sunlight.  the  system  design  and  modelling  of  the  cvross  are  described  in  this  section.  shows  an  illustrative  overview  of  the  cvross  deployed  at  the  roadside.  the  design  of  the  cvross  has  four  major  components:  i  roadside  surveillance  technology  using  the  iot,  ii  data  preprocessing  in  the  cvross,  iii  decision  support  for  roadside  parking  and  iv

__label__situationalsurveillance of  relying  heavily  on  external  power  or  solar  energy,  the  devices  connect  wirelessly  to  a  cloud  platform,  allowing  continuous  data  transfer  to  the  cvross  and  realtime  monitoring  of  occupancy  and  vacancy  data,  retaining  uptodate  roadside  information  for  24  h  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.  by  using  application  program  interfaces  apis,  the  collected  data  can  be  examined  at  the  preprocessing  stage  by  the  proposed  decision  support  model;  thus,  the  roadside  traffic  information  can  be  observed  in  real  time.  via  a  vision  module  and  machine  learning,  users  are  provided  with  hundreds  of  functions  for  acquiring  images  from  a  multitude  of  vision
__label__situationalsurveillance devices,  for  further  processing  by  locating  features,  identifying  objects  and  measuring  parts.  in  addition,  machines  can  learn  from  empirical  data,  making  predictions  about  future  data.  hd  vision  devices  are  expected  to  be  used,  to  provide  the  best  compromise  between  maximum  observation  accuracy  and  minimum  overlapping  field  of  view,  to  generate  the  best  viewpoint.  image  data  are  then  processed  by  denoising  and  image  tuning,  leading  to  target  object  detection,  recognition,  identification,  classification  and  calculation  of  available  parking  spaces.  as  a  result,  useful  and  easily  accessible  traffic  information  on  realtime  roadside  occupancy  and  vacancy  can  be  provided  to  road  users.  furthermore,  with
__label__situationalsurveillance the  aid  of  machine  learning  techniques  applied  in  a  timedomain  dynamic  system,  both  the  accuracy  and  the  efficiency  of  the  system  are  enhanced.  various  reports  can  be  generated  for  road  users,  logistics  companies  and  the  public,  for  decisionmaking  via  big  data  analysis.  after  installation  of  the  wireless  hd  vision  devices  connected  to  the  cvross,  cloudbased  servers  can  be  used  with  iot  communication  protocols.  data  analytics  and  computation  modules  function  as  the  backend  cloud  server,  and  the  results  are  retrieved  and  displayed  in  frontend  applications  for  end  users.  the  process  flow  of  the  proposed  system  is  illustrated  in  .  transparency  of
__label__situationalsurveillance roadside  activities  and  information  can  be  enhanced  and  reports  can  be  produced  at  the  end  of  every  timed  loop,  after  image  processing.  process  flow  of  the  cvross.  before  running  the  cvross,  parameters  must  be  set  up,  including  types  of  vehicles,  vehicle  parking  space  regulations  and  minimum  width  of  traffic  lanes.  these  correspond  to  the  regulations  issued  by  the  hong  kong  special  administrative  region  planning  department  .  therefore,  the  system  can  compare  the  captured  images  with  templates  in  the  database,  in  order  to  process  images  and  data  more  accurately  in  the  later  stages.  to  facilitate  the  calculation  of  parking  gaps  and
__label__situationalsurveillance available  parking  spaces,  differences  in  the  dimensions  of  all  items  caused  by  nonidentical  distances  from  the  vision  device  are  ignored  in  the  computation  process.  in  other  words,  it  is  assumed  that  each  of  the  items  presented  in  a  case  has  the  same  dimensions  in  millimetres  or  pixels,  regardless  of  its  position  in  terms  of  distance  in  relation  to  the  vision  device.  in  the  computation  process,  the  preliminary  parameters  include:  640  480  pixels  for  the  entire  coverage  of  the  vision  device  11  m  of  regulated  parking  space  per  truck  7  m  of  regulated  parking  space  per  cargo  van  5  m  of
__label__situationalsurveillance regulated  parking  space  per  private  car  6.75  m  for  the  minimum  width  of  traffic  lanes  templates  of  all  possible  vehicles  and  objects  a  confidence  score,  which  indicates  the  confidence  of  the  disparity  for  each  pixel  for  each  template  image  scores  return  values  between  0  and  1000,  where  1000  indicates  the  highest  confidence.  after  the  parameters  are  input  into  the  cvross,  the  program  starts  the  first  stage  of  the  timed  loop,  i.e.,  vision  acquisition.  the  wireless  hd  vision  devices  connected  to  the  cvross  can  then  capture  images  from  the  roadside  continually  and  automatically.  afterwards,  the  collected  data  are  used  in:  i
__label__situationalsurveillance noise  reduction  and  ii  vehicle  and  object  recognition  and  matching.  one  of  the  most  important  stages  in  the  entire  system  flow  is  noise  reduction.  this  is  a  process  of  removing  noise  from  an  image,  as  the  noise  might  degrade  both  the  visual  quality  and  the  effectiveness  of  subsequent  processing  tasks  .  in  this  case  according  to  the  simulation  model,  on  the  roadside  and  in  traffic  lanes,  there  are  different  objects  and  signals,  such  as  traffic  indicators  and  instructions  in  traffic  lanes.  however,  these  are  likely  to  be  unrelated  to  vehicle  and  object  recognition  and  matching,  therefore  they  may  negatively  affect
__label__situationalsurveillance matching  results  and  the  effectiveness  of  the  subsequent  calculation  of  available  parking  spaces.  furthermore,  even  similar  vehicles,  such  as  two  private  cars  in  this  case,  may  be  the  same  model  but  different  in  colour.  therefore,  noise  reduction  can  ensure  that  unrelated  objects,  indicators  and  signals  are  removed  before  further  processing  of  the  images.  this  also  prevents  problems  with  colour  classification.  in  ,  an  example  of  noise  reduction  is  illustrated.  before  noise  reduction,  the  image  obtained  from  vision  acquisition  was  full  of  obstacles,  such  as  a  road  sign,  a  traffic  cone  and  yellow  box  markings.  all  these  were  a  hindrance  to
__label__situationalsurveillance vehicle  and  object  recognition  and  matching.  noise  reduction  was  achieved  using  an  image  mask  to  exclude  irrelevant  regions  of  the  image,  colour  plane  extraction  to  convert  the  colour  image  to  a  binary  image  in  only  black  and  white,  and  basic  morphology  to  modify  the  shape  of  binary  objects  in  the  image,  as  well  as  to  adjust  the  brightness.  after  noise  reduction,  the  indicator,  traffic  cone  and  yellow  box  markings  had  been  removed  blacked  out  and  only  the  private  car  remained  on  the  screen  with  its  shape  shown  in  white.  an  example  of  noise  reduction.  two  common  matching  methods  are  provided
__label__situationalsurveillance by  the  cvross:  pattern  matching  and  geometric  matching.  if  all  the  items  that  need  to  be  detected  and  matched  share  the  same  features,  pattern  matching  is  the  best  method,  as  it  will  compare  all  the  features  and  colours  of  an  item  from  the  template  and  the  captured  image.  however,  not  all  vehicles  and  objects  are  the  same.  for  example,  some  owners  may  paint  the  roof  or  body  of  a  vehicle.  therefore,  not  all  objects  have  the  same  patterns  or  the  same  colours.  this  may  negatively  impact  on  the  effectiveness  of  vehicle  and  object  recognition  and  matching.  as  a  result,  together
__label__situationalsurveillance with  noise  reduction  converting  the  captured  image  to  a  binary  image  in  only  black  and  white,  geometric  matching  seems  more  suitable  for  use  in  the  cvross  to  detect,  recognize  and  match  different  types  of  vehicles  and  objects  based  on  their  shapes,  lengths  and  other  significant  features,  as  well  as  to  determine  the  image  score  values  mentioned.  it  can  prevent  failure  of  recognition  and  matching  of  an  item  due  to  different  patterns  and  colours.  in  this  case,  when  the  image  is  acquired  properly  and  noise  has  been  reduced,  the  process  of  recognition  and  matching  can  then  be  carried  out.  vehicle  and
__label__situationalsurveillance object  recognition  and  matching  are  based  on  templates  inserted  during  the  setup  process  for  the  system  parameters.  when  an  object  appears,  or  a  vehicle  passes  by  or  parks  inside  the  angle  of  view  of  the  hd  vision  devices,  the  devices  will  capture  images  and  compare  them  automatically  with  the  templates  in  the  database.  thus,  vehicles  and  objects  can  be  assigned  to  a  category  after  recognition.  in  the  following  sections,  parkinggap  calculations,  parkingspace  evaluation  and  decision  support  in  parking  are  considered  and  evaluated,  as  shown  in  .  the  block  diagram  shows  that  the  entire  computation  involves  three  components:  i  conversion  between
__label__situationalsurveillance pixel  values  and  actual  scale  for  road  traffic,  ii  fuzzy  logic  for  vehicle  parking  reservation  and  iii  decision  support  for  parking  activities.  after  vehicles  and  objects  have  been  recognized  and  matched,  the  cvross  calculates  parking  gaps  for  each  individual  traffic  lane.  first,  the  conversion  between  the  pixel  value  collected  from  the  image  and  the  actual  scale  should  be  implemented,  via  experimental  studies.  the  actual  scale  of  the  road  traffic  is  affected  by  the  height  of  the  camera  h  from  ground  level  and  the  viewing  angle  of  the  camera  .  the  conversion  ratio  is  essential  for  estimating  the  actual  number  of
__label__situationalsurveillance parking  spaces  and  is  utilized  in  the  following  analysis.  as  indicated  in  ,  in  the  first  traffic  lane,  shown  at  the  top  of  the  image,  there  are  three  vehicles,  and  each  of  them  has  four  corner  points,  i.e.,  x  ,  y  ,  x  ,  y  ,  x  ,  y  ,  x  ,  y  x  ,  y  for  the  first  vehicle  v  .  in  general,  the  four  corner  points  of  vehicle  v  can  be  presented  in  the  form  x  ,  y  ,  x  ,  y  ,  x  ,  y  ,  x  ,  y  x  ,  y  ,  where  n  is  the
__label__situationalsurveillance number  of  vehicles  captured  in  the  image.  overview  of  the  computations  in  the  cvross.  illustration  of  calculation  of  parking  gaps.  in  this  study,  it  is  supposed  that  the  cameras  are  mounted  on  street  lights  and  nearby  facilities,  so  that  the  heights  and  viewing  angles  of  the  cameras  may  be  different.  thus,  adjustment  of  the  images  taken  by  cameras  that  are  not  mounted  on  street  lights  is  needed,  in  order  to  standardize  the  image  for  conversion.  referring  to  the  governments  streetlight  design  and  other  work  ,  ,  a  conversion  ratio  mapping  can  be  established  to  deal  with  various  predefined  heights  and
__label__situationalsurveillance angles  of  the  cameras,  in  order  to  standardize  their  field  of  view  fov.  illustrates  the  scenario  of  mounting  cameras  at  different  heights  with  different  viewing  angles.  in  the  default  setting,  the  cameras  that  are  mounted  on  the  street  lights  are  set  vertically,  to  cover  a  particular  fov.  for  other  camera  settings  with  different  heights  and  viewing  angles,  the  image  and  the  fov  are  then  adjusted  back  to  the  default  setting.  to  achieve  the  above  goal,  a  conversion  mapping  profile  is  established  via  experimental  studies  for  several  predefined  configurations,  and  thus  the  ratio  is  defined  for  the  conversion  between  pixel  values
__label__situationalsurveillance and  actual  scales  for  road  traffic.  consequently,  the  conversion  ratio  can  be  applied  for  calculating  the  actual  length  and  width  of  vehicles.  illustration  of  various  camera  positions.  after  the  four  corner  points  of  each  vehicle  have  been  retrieved,  the  cvross  computes  the  maximum  and  minimum  values  of  x  and  y,  i.e.,  l  x  n  and  l  y  n  ,  to  represent  the  actual  length  and  width  of  vehicle  v  respectively,  according  to  equations  1  and  2.  using  the  above  information,  the  size  of  the  vehicle  captured  by  the  camera  is  known,  and  the  spaces  for  vehicle  parking  reservation  are  then
__label__situationalsurveillance computed  using  fuzzy  logic:  in  fuzzy  logic,  there  are  three  processes:  fuzzification,  the  inference  engine  and  defuzzification.  these  evaluate  the  reservation  factor  0,  1  and  the  estimated  time  of  stay  t  from  three  inputs,  i.e.,  parking  time  t  ,  l  x  n  and  l  y  n  .  in  fuzzification,  the  input  and  output  parameters  are  fuzzified  with  a  set  of  defined  fuzzy  classes,  such  as  small,  medium  and  high,  and  the  degree  of  belongingness  ,  all  taking  values  between  zero  and  one.  for  example,  the  parking  time  t  is  fuzzified  with  its  corresponding  membership  functions  to  show  the  degree  of
__label__situationalsurveillance belongingness,  as  in  equation  3  where  x  represents  all  elements  in  t  ,  x  is  the  membership  function  of  fuzzy  class  a  in  x  and  n  is  the  total  number  of  elements  x  .  in  the  inference  engine,  the  set  of  rules  r  r  ,  r  ,  r  ,,  r  is  used  to  evaluate  the  aggregated  outputs  from  the  input  parameters,  where  m  is  the  total  number  of  rules  collected  from  interviewing  the  domain  experts.  the  mechanism  of  the  inference  engine  is  referred  to  as  mamdanis  method  ,  where  the  consequences  of  the  rules  are  expressed  by  fuzzy  sets  rather
__label__situationalsurveillance than  linear  mathematical  expressions.  equation  4  shows  the  inference  process  for  obtaining  the  aggregated  outputs.  the  or  operator  is  applied  for  combining  all  the  membership  function  values,  resulting  in  a  bounded  area  in  the  output  membership  functions.  in  defuzzification,  the  outputs  in  fuzzy  sets  are  then  converted  back  to  crisp  values  x  using  the  centroid  method,  which  measures  the  centre  of  gravity  of  the  bounded  area,  as  shown  in  equation  5.  in  the  application,  when  the  region  of  the  vehicle  is  recognized  in  the  image,  the  parking  time,  reservation  factor  and  estimated  time  of  stay  for  the  vehicle  can  be
__label__situationalsurveillance measured,  to  truly  reflect  the  occupied  spaces  for  vehicle  parking.  the  membership  functions  used  in  fuzzy  logic  are  predefined  intuitively  by  interviewing  domain  experts  and  industrialists,  as  shown  in  :  definitions  of  fuzzy  classes  and  membership  functions  in  the  cvross.  input:  x,n  y,n  t  output:  t  remarks:  trimf  refers  to  the  triangular  shape  of  the  membership  functions;  trapmf  refers  to  the  trapezoid  shape  of  the  membership  functions.  to  calculate  the  parking  gap  between  vehicles,  four  situations  should  be  taken  into  consideration,  as  shown  in  .  to  prevent  errors  of  unlimited  value,  the  largest  pixel  value  for  length  the  640th  pixel
__label__situationalsurveillance rather  than  the  first  pixel,  is  utilized  to  compute  the  first  gap,  namely,  the  end  gap  g  .  hence,  in  accordance  with  equation  6,  the  end  gap  g  can  be  computed  by  subtracting  the  maximum  x  value  of  the  first  vehicle  v  from  the  maximum  pixel  value  for  length,  i.e.,  640  pixels.  for  cases  1  and  2  in  ,  the  calculation  of  the  end  gap  is  performed  via  equation  6,  and  the  end  gap  is  the  partial  parking  gap  between  two  vehicles,  such  that  the  information  from  the  right  camera  should  be  considered  to  measure  the  whole  parking  gap  between
__label__situationalsurveillance the  two  vehicles  as  for  case  1  or  3.  for  cases  3  and  4  in  ,  since  the  maximum  x  value  of  the  first  vehicle  v  is  equal  to  the  maximum  pixel  value,  this  implies  that  the  end  gap  is  equal  to  zero  and  the  length  of  the  first  vehicle  captured  by  the  camera  does  not  represent  the  actual  length  of  the  vehicle.  the  information  from  the  right  camera  should  be  collected  and  combined  with  the  partial  length  of  v  to  confirm  the  actual  length  of  v  ,  whilst  the  situation  of  the  left  camera  should  be  similar  to  case
__label__situationalsurveillance 2  or  4.  in  the  algorithm,  the  parking  gap  g  between  vehicles  n  and  n  1  can  be  generalized  for  one  specific  traffic  lane,  as  shown  in  equation  7.  the  parking  gap  in  pixel  values  can  be  obtained  and  can  be  converted  back  to  the  actual  scale  using  the  pixeltoactualscale  conversion  ratio.  when  considering  cases  1  and  3,  x  cannot  be  observed  for  computing  g  ,  so  that  maxx  is  defined  to  be  zero,  which  defines  the  edge  of  the  captured  image.  all  the  above  situations  were  considered  in  the  proposed  system,  and  parkingspace  assignment  was  then  conducted  for  three
__label__situationalsurveillance types  of  vehicles:  a  private  car,  a  cargo  van  and  a  truck,  with  regulatory  parking  spaces  of  5  m,  7  m  and  11  m  respectively  .  four  possible  cases  for  capturing  images.  calculation  of  parking  gaps  is  useful  for  computing  the  available  parking  spaces.  after  gathering  data  on  parking  gaps  in  traffic  lanes,  the  cvross  can  carry  out  further  processing  by  dividing  the  length  of  each  gap  by  the  lengths  of  different  types  of  vehicles  input  as  one  of  the  parameters  described  in  ,  via  equation  8  for  a  truck,  van  and  private  car.  if  the  length  is  less  than
__label__situationalsurveillance the  length  of  a  private  car,  the  objects  are  classified  as  others,  e.g.,  obstacles  in  the  road.  therefore,  the  information  on  available  parking  spaces  s  ,  s  and  s  for  the  three  types  of  vehicles  in  each  individual  traffic  lane,  or  even  for  the  whole  road,  is  produced,  to  inform  road  users  about  realtime  roadside  occupancy  and  vacancy.  consequently,  the  proposed  system  can  provide  three  decision  support  functionalities:  evaluation  of  average  space  utilization,  measurement  of  loading  and  unloading  activity  and  average  waiting  time  for  parking.  considering  that  there  are  p  cameras  in  the  whole  traffic  lane,  the  average  space  utilization
__label__situationalsurveillance u  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  total  available  parking  gaps  by  the  maximum  length  of  the  image  in  pixels,  as  shown  in  equation  9,  where  g  represents  the  available  parking  gap  i  determined  by  camera  j  and  pixel  j  represents  the  maximum  pixel  value  of  camera  j.  if  the  traffic  space  is  occupied  by  trucks  and  cargo  vans  instead  of  private  cars,  these  are  regarded  as  engaging  in  loading  and  unloading  activities.  the  indication  of  performing  loading  and  unloading  activities  lua  is  calculated  by  dividing  the  sum  of  the  lengths  of  the  vehicles,  for  l  x  n  5,  by  the
__label__situationalsurveillance actual  total  length  of  the  traffic  lane  l  under  surveillance  by  camera  p  ,  as  in  equation  10.  the  indication  of  loading  and  unloading  activities  is  assumed  to  be  updated  hourly  in  the  proposed  system,  to  conveniently  track  the  traffic  situation.  for  average  waiting  times  for  parking,  the  proposed  system  will  determine  the  waiting  time  for  the  entire  traffic  lane  when  any  available  parking  space  g  is  less  than  the  required  parking  space  for  a  private  car  representing  the  smallest  parking  space  for  the  three  types  of  vehicles.  therefore,  users  can  make  an  appropriate  decision  according  to  the  above  three
__label__situationalsurveillance indicators:  in  addition,  the  cvross  was  run  with  a  timestamp  control.  frequently  updating  realtime  information  allows  road  users  to  obtain  useful  information  about  realtime  roadside  occupancy  and  vacancy.  thus,  road  users  can  make  good  use  of  the  information  to  make  realtime  decisions,  such  as  parking  their  vehicles  on  the  road  or  finding  other  roads.  in  addition,  running  the  program  with  a  time  delay  can  prevent  overrunning  and  overloading  of  the  server,  thus  maintaining  a  high  level  of  stability  and  accuracy  of  calculation.  the  evaluation  of  the  proposed  cvross  system  is  twofold:  i  validation  of  parkinggap  estimations  and  ii  system  performance
__label__situationalsurveillance from  the  perspectives  of  drivers  and  property  management  companies.  the  parkinggap  estimation  is  validated  using  a  paired  sample  ttest  for  examining  the  difference  between  two  sets  of  50  sample  data  points,  i.e.,  estimated  and  actual  parking  gaps.  this  is  aimed  at  investigating  the  appropriateness  of  parkinggap  estimations  in  the  cvross.  on  the  other  hand,  the  satisfaction  and  the  system  performance  are  evaluated  by  interviewing  drivers  and  property  management  company  representatives,  using  a  survey.  shows  sample  questions  used  to  obtain  feedback.  the  survey  was  conducted  in  two  timeframes:  i  before  implementing  the  cvross  and  ii  three  months  after  implementing  the  cvross.
__label__situationalsurveillance as  a  result,  a  comparative  summary  before  and  after  implementing  cvross  was  produced,  for  further  statistical  analysis.  sample  of  survey  questions  for  evaluating  system  performance.  to  validate  the  feasibility  and  performance  of  the  proposed  system,  a  case  study  was  conducted,  implementing  the  cvross  in  kwun  tong  district,  hong  kong.  due  to  the  seriousness  and  urgency  of  the  problem  of  traffic  congestion  in  hong  kong,  particularly  in  kwun  tong  district,  an  iotbased  system  for  surveillance  of  roadside  loading  and  unloading  bays  is  much  needed.  the  entire  implementation  was  divided  into  three  phases:  i  site  selection,  ii  deployment  of  the  cvross  and
__label__situationalsurveillance iii  establishment  of  webbased  user  interfaces.  the  project  commenced  with  data  collection  mainly  from  selected  site  visits  focusing  on  kwun  tong  district.  having  obtained  a  better  understanding  of  traffic  situations  and  occupation,  a  simulation  model  was  built  based  on  traffic  features  and  real  cases  in  kwun  tong  district.  subsequently,  a  solution  with  the  cvross  system  architecture  was  deployed  to  tackle  the  issue  with  the  help  of  a  web  application.  thus,  implementing  the  cvross  involved  the  application  of  computer  vision,  cloud  computing,  big  data  analysis  and  reusable  energy  solar  power,  to  detect,  recognize  and  match  vehicles  and  objects,  hence  providing  road

__label__situationalsurveillance and  information  on  the  surroundings  of  the  selected  roads,  such  as  the  number  of  lamp  posts,  traffic  lights  and  traffic  lanes,  together  with  distances  and  the  lengths  and  widths  of  the  roads.  data  on  traffic  situations  in  the  area  considered  were  collected  through  observation,  to  obtain  a  better  understanding  of  the  real  state  of  occupation  and  traffic  congestion.  selected  traffic  lanes  for  site  visits.  as  a  major  industrial  area,  kwun  tong  district  sees  a  large  number  of  loading  and  unloading  activities  every  day.  firstly,  vehicles  temporarily  doubleparked  for  loading  or  unloading  or  waiting  for  roadside  spaces  to  become  available,  are
__label__situationalsurveillance common  in  the  area  of  interest.  because  a  large  number  of  trucks  usually  doublepark  on  hing  yip  street,  serious  traffic  congestion  can  occur.  secondly,  as  parking  spaces  are  scarce  in  kwun  tong  district,  some  nearby  companies  might  occupy  the  roadside  with  objects  such  as  traffic  cones  and  boards,  to  preserve  parking  spaces.  this  situation  hinders  other  road  users  from  using  the  road.  therefore,  in  addition  to  detection,  recognition  and  classification  of  various  vehicles  and  objects,  the  computer  visionbased  roadside  surveillance  system  needs  to  provide  road  users  and  logistics  companies  with  information  about  occupancy  and  vacancy,  so  that  they  can  optimize
__label__situationalsurveillance fleet  schedules  based  on  analytical  information  via  selfregulation.  external  walls  of  buildings  and  lamp  posts  are  the  only  possible  positions  for  installing  the  hd  vision  devices  for  capturing  images  in  the  computer  visionbased  surveillance  system.  there  is  some  difficulty  in  installing  hd  vision  devices  on  the  external  walls  of  buildings,  particularly  on  commercial  buildings,  without  permission.  it  is  believed  that  most  property  owners  are  likely  to  refuse  to  install  the  hd  vision  devices  due  to  a  lack  of  benefits  and  effects  on  the  appearance  of  their  buildings.  furthermore,  various  buildings  may  have  different  features  at  different  heights,  and  this  may
__label__situationalsurveillance lead  to  difficulties  in  unifying  standards,  such  as  the  height  of  all  hd  vision  devices,  thus  negatively  affecting  vision  and  possibly  creating  some  overlaps.  therefore,  lamp  posts,  managed  by  the  highways  department  of  the  hong  kong  government,  are  recommended  as  the  best  places  to  install  the  hd  vision  devices  along  roads  and  streets.  in  the  areas  considered,  lamp  posts  have  a  mounting  height  of  10  m,  set  by  the  highways  department  .  the  highways  department  is  responsible  for  preventive  and  corrective  maintenance  of  lamp  posts.  this  is  beneficial  for  the  installation  and  operation  of  the  vision  devices  and  computer  visionbased
__label__situationalsurveillance surveillance  system,  as  breakdowns  and  errors  can  be  resolved  promptly  to  maintain  a  high  level  of  stability  in  the  system,  compared  with  installations  on  the  external  walls  of  buildings.  in  the  design  of  the  cvross,  the  deployment  of  the  proposed  system  consists  of  four  major  components:  i  noise  reduction,  ii  vehicle  recognition,  iii  calculation  of  parking  gaps  and  iv  calculation  of  available  parking  spaces.  the  proposed  system  was  deployed  using  simulink  and  labview  for  algorithm  modelling  and  realworld  prototyping  respectively,  as  shown  in  .  the  models  and  algorithms  for  parkinggap  calculation  and  parkinggap  assignment  and  the  fuzzy  logic  for  vehicle

__label__situationalsurveillance negatively  influence  the  results  of  recognition  and  matching.  it  was  found  that,  after  noise  reduction,  only  the  shapes  of  related  vehicles  remained.  this  could  facilitate  the  subsequent  processing  of  the  image.  as  a  result,  better  and  more  accurate  processing  could  be  achieved,  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  the  designed  system.  however,  different  roads  with  their  own  features  and  characteristics  may  require  different  techniques  for  noise  reduction,  to  remove  unrelated  signals  from  an  image.  this  may  represent  a  timeconsuming  modification  when  the  system  is  applied  to  different  roads  in  hong  kong.  image  differences  before  and  after  noise  reduction.  to  determine  the
__label__situationalsurveillance dimensions  of  specific  vehicles,  the  technique  of  geometric  matching  was  used  to  recognize  and  match  two  trucks  with  different  appearances.  it  was  found  that  the  cvross  was  able  to  detect,  recognize  and  match  vehicles  from  all  traffic  lanes  on  the  road  and  those  in  an  individual  traffic  lane.  general  traffic  conditions  could  be  interpreted  using  the  information  from  the  matching  results  for  all  traffic  lanes  on  the  road,  for  example,  for  the  issue  of  vehicles  remaining  doubleparked.  on  the  other  hand,  information  from  an  individual  traffic  lane  was  capable  of  illustrating  situations  in  a  particular  traffic  lane,  to  determine  the

__label__situationalsurveillance various  types  of  vehicles  could  be  identified  and  computed,  for  cases  where  l  ,  h  and  are  welldefined.  shows  the  fuzzy  logic  toolbox  running  in  the  matlab  runtime  compiler  on  the  server  side  of  the  cvross.  the  input  and  outputwith  their  corresponding  membership  functions  as  given  in  were  created,  and  the  fuzzification  process,  mamdanis  inference  and  the  defuzzification  process  were  defined.  thus,  the  fuzzy  capability  of  parking  reservation  can  be  included  in  the  computation  of  parking  gaps.  fuzzy  logic  in  matlab  runtime  compiler.  illustrates  the  lengths  of  the  parking  gaps  in  three  lanes  with  different  numbers  of  vehicles.  when  there
__label__situationalsurveillance was  no  vehicle  in  lane  1,  the  end  gap  was  displayed  as  640  pixels,  which  indicated  that  all  the  pixels  were  available,  while  the  other  gaps  had  zero  value.  from  the  computations,  it  was  found  that  the  algorithm  was  able  to  calculate  the  parking  gaps  programmatically,  based  on  the  previous  matching  results.  for  example,  if  no  vehicles  are  in  the  traffic  lane,  only  the  end  gap  is  shown.  as  a  result,  information  on  the  length  of  all  parking  gaps  can  be  produced  and  used  for  further  processing.  however,  the  number  of  gaps  needed  to  be  set  before  running  the  program.
__label__situationalsurveillance thus,  further  calculation  was  required  regarding  the  capacity  of  a  particular  road  and  traffic  lane.  then,  the  possible  number  of  parking  gaps  that  may  need  to  be  computed  was  set.  parking  gaps  in  the  three  individual  traffic  lanes.  the  calculation  of  available  parking  spaces  was  then  tested  by  applying  the  cvross,  after  obtaining  the  data  on  parking  gaps.  based  on  the  proposed  algorithm,  the  length  of  each  parking  gap  in  pixels  was  divided  by  the  length  of  each  type  of  vehicle  and  the  constant  reserved  for  parking  that  particular  vehicle.  the  number  of  vehicles  available  for  parking  in  the  individual
__label__situationalsurveillance traffic  lane  was  computed  by  the  algorithm.  if  the  number  of  private  cars  which  are  the  shortest  vehicles  in  the  scenario  was  equal  to  zero,  this  meant  that  a  particular  parking  gap  was  wasted.  furthermore,  the  cvross  was  able  to  add  up  the  lengths  of  all  vehicles  and  available  parking  spaces,  and  show  these  as  occupancy  and  vacancy  respectively,  as  well  as  showing  the  wasted  spaces  in  the  individual  traffic  lane,  to  provide  users  with  information  on  the  general  traffic  conditions.  therefore,  by  dividing  the  length  of  parking  gaps  by  the  length  of  each  type  of  vehicle,  the  cvrossusing  the
__label__situationalsurveillance function  for  calculation  of  available  parking  spacesproved  its  ability  to  compute,  and  provide  users  with,  information  about  the  number  of  spaces  available  for  parking  in  each  area.  thus,  it  is  useful  and  helpful  to  users  in  making  immediate  decisions  and  for  selfregulation.  for  example,  if  there  are  no  longer  any  available  parking  spaces,  drivers  can  decide  to  park  their  vehicles  on  other  roads,  to  prevent  traffic  congestion  occurring.  furthermore,  the  cvross  is  also  applicable  to  object  recognition  and  matching.  shows  the  aggregation  of  available  parking  spaces  in  specific  lanes.  the  data  on  parking  gaps  collected  from  several  cameras  are  summarized
__label__situationalsurveillance to  form  the  set  of  aggregated  results  of  parking  gaps  and  used  to  assign  various  types  of  vehicles  to  the  empty  gaps.  thus,  the  cvross  is  still  able  to  compute  the  parking  gaps  and  available  parking  spaces  to  show  occupancy  and  vacancy,  as  well  as  the  wasted  spaces,  for  the  situation  where  there  is  occupation  by  an  object  in  the  traffic  lane.  calculation  of  available  parking  spaces  in  the  case  of  occupation  by  an  object.  it  is  crucial  to  provide  users  with  a  goodquality  interface  for  information  visualization  that  is  easy  to  understand  and  simple  to  use.  the  cvross  is
__label__situationalsurveillance able  to  offer  users  various  forms  of  information  visualization.  the  results  of  vehicles  detected  and  matched,  as  well  as  the  parking  gaps  and  available  parking  spaces  computed,  can  be  presented  graphically.  an  interface  design  for  information  visualization  is  presented  in  .  an  image  display  was  utilized  to  present  realtime  traffic  situations  on  the  road  within  the  system  time.  this  could  provide  users  with  a  general  view  of  the  areas  under  surveillance.  in  addition,  as  shown  in  ,  on  the  main  dashboard  of  the  cvross,  various  reports  about  road  usage  by  different  types  of  vehicles  can  be  generated  for  road  users,

__label__situationalsurveillance of  parking  gap  estimation,  compared  with  the  actual  measured  parking  gap.  the  accuracy  comparison  between  estimated  and  actual  parking  gaps  is  shown  in  .  a  paired  sample  ttest  was  applied  to  examine  the  difference  between  estimated  and  actual  parking  gaps,  and  the  null  hypothesis  was  to  assume  that  the  mean  difference  was  zero.  it  was  found  that  statistical  significance  for  the  mean  difference  was  achieved  with  a  p  value  of  0.02;  thus,  the  measurement  of  parking  gaps  using  the  cvross  can  be  considered  feasible.  the  average  and  maximum  errors  for  parking  gap  estimation  were  1.47  m  and  3.60  m,  respectively.
__label__situationalsurveillance moreover,  the  accuracy  of  estimation  of  the  time  of  stay  was  also  assessed  using  50  samples  to  compare  estimated  and  actual  times  of  stay,  as  shown  in  .  a  paired  sample  ttest  was  also  applied  to  examine  the  difference  between  estimated  and  actual  times  of  stay,  and  the  null  hypothesis  was  to  assume  the  mean  difference  was  zero.  it  was  found  that  statistical  significance  for  the  mean  difference  was  achieved  with  a  p  value  of  0.015;  thus,  the  estimation  of  time  of  stay  can  be  considered  feasible.  the  average  and  maximum  errors  in  the  estimation  of  time  of  stay  were

__label__situationalsurveillance were  generally  satisfied  with  the  proposed  system,  as  it  could  improve  the  poor  situation  regarding  doubleparking  and  traffic  congestion  in  busy  districts.  comparative  analysis  before  and  after  using  the  cvross.  notes:  uom  refers  to  unit  of  measurement;  scale  110  refers  to  a  likert  scale  from  1  to  10,  while  10  is  the  highest  score  in  scale  and  1  is  the  lowest  score  in  scale.  a  while  loop  a  control  flow  statement  that  allows  code  to  be  executed  repeatedly  can  also  be  utilized  in  the  servers.  this  allows  the  program  to  be  run  every  second  or  even  more  frequently,  also  enabling
__label__situationalsurveillance data,  information  and  reports  to  be  saved  every  second  or  more  frequently.  although  this  can  provide  users  with  regularly  updated  information,  the  server  overloads  easily,  as  large  quantities  of  data,  information  and  reports  must  be  processed  and  saved.  thus,  the  stability  of  the  system  is  negatively  affected.  for  example,  assuming  a  month  has  30  days,  there  are  2,592,000  s  in  a  month  for  an  excel  file  generated  programmatically  utilizing  a  while  loop.  this  means  that  there  are  2,592,000  records  per  month,  generating  approximately  31,536,000  records  per  year.  this  could  be  problematic  for  big  data  analysis  after  a  number  of  years,
__label__situationalsurveillance as  more  data  are  generated.  as  a  result,  a  timed  loop  is  suggested  instead  of  a  while  loop.  in  this  case,  the  timed  loop  is  set  with  a  fiveminute  delay.  thus,  it  can  still  update  the  realtime  traffic  information  frequently  for  road  users,  facilitating  the  operations  of  the  cvross  and  loading  the  server  smoothly,  to  prevent  overloading  and  to  maintain  stability,  facilitating  the  process  of  big  data  analysis.  in  fact,  the  fiveminute  delay  can  be  adjusted,  based  on  the  real  needs  of  road  users,  hence  providing  them  with  a  more  userfriendly  system.  the  feasibility  and  the  performance  of  the  cvross
__label__situationalsurveillance have  been  demonstrated  by  the  case  study  and  implementation.  the  proposed  system  makes  three  major  contributions  to  research  and  society:  i  smart  parking  for  roadside  operations,  ii  applied  artificial  intelligence  for  roadside  parking  activities  and  iii  an  environmentallyfriendly  business  model  for  property  management  companies.  in  the  field  of  urban  development,  smart  cities  are  thought  to  be  a  future  trend  and  emerging  technologies  are  applied  to  formulate  different  forms  of  decision  support  and  intelligence,  to  improve  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  in  the  evolution  of  the  smart  city,  smart  mobility  is  specific  to  objects  including  human  beings,  transportation  and  logistics.  the  ontology  of
__label__situationalsurveillance smart  parking  is  developed  from  smart  transportation,  which  is  an  active  research  area.  in  this  paper,  smart  parking  for  roadside  operations  was  applied,  to  eliminate  doubleparking  and  enhance  roadside  occupancy.  via  the  adoption  of  iot  technologies,  the  new  topic  of  smart  parking  has  been  explored  to  address  the  problem  of  doubleparking  at  the  roadside.  therefore,  novel  contributions  relating  to  smart  parking  have  been  made  in  this  paper.  in  the  evaluation  of  parking  gaps  and  available  parking  spaces,  the  proposed  system  makes  use  of  fuzzy  logic  to  classify  various  types  of  vehicles  in  reallife  situations,  i.e.,  private  cars,  cargo  vans,  trucks
__label__situationalsurveillance and  obstacles.  fuzzy  logic  offers  flexibility  and  intelligence  in  the  algorithm,  to  generate  certain  decision  support  functionalities.  therefore,  the  proposed  system  is  able  to  evaluate  reservation  spaces  and  the  estimated  time  of  stay  of  the  vehicles.  this  information  can  be  used  to  estimate  average  space  utilization,  loading  and  unloading  activity  and  average  waiting  times  for  parking.  overall,  the  data  collected  by  iot  technologies  and  the  data  on  roadside  activities  are  integrated  using  artificial  intelligence  techniques,  i.e.,  fuzzy  logic,  to  create  value  in  industrial  applications.  considering  the  findings  from  implementing  the  proposed  system,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  proposed  system
__label__situationalsurveillance has  advantages  with  respect  to  energysaving,  time  efficiency  and  better  roadside  occupancy.  for  example,  if  there  are  always  many  trucks  loading  and  unloading  on  monday  mornings,  some  logistics  companies  can  plan  to  change  their  schedules  in  order  to  load  or  unload  goods  at  other  times,  to  prevent  waiting  at  times  of  traffic  congestion.  thus,  the  system  is  able  to  facilitate  traffic  and  fleet  management  by  selfregulation.  the  interface  and  related  information  can  be  further  amended  and  transferred  to  a  mobile  application  to  enhance  the  transparency  of  roadside  activities.  via  selfregulation  by  road  users  and  logistics  companies  taking  advantage  of  information
__label__situationalsurveillance and  communication  technologies,  the  system  relieves  traffic  congestion,  achieves  an  efficient  road  network  and  facilitates  the  development  and  management  of  a  reliable  and  intelligent  transport  system.  this  work  is  not  only  beneficial  to  property  management  companies  and  drivers,  but  also  has  a  positive  influence  on  hong  kong  society,  fostering  an  environmentally  friendly  and  safe  atmosphere  in  roadside  operations.  by  adopting  the  cvross,  companies  could  save  on  costs  and  labour  power  for  managing  roadside  activities,  and  thus  business  profitability  could  be  improved.  roadside  activities,  such  as  loading  and  unloading,  negatively  affect  traffic  situations  if  not  kept  under  control.  hence,  smart  mobility
__label__situationalsurveillance is  crucial  for  builtup  areas  in  hong  kong,  aligning  with  smartcity  development.  this  is  especially  the  case  where  no  realtime  information  about  the  roadside  activities,  occupancy  and  vacancy  is  accessible  to  the  general  public  and  road  users.  the  cvross  is  a  fully  integrated  solution,  equipped  with  a  set  of  wireless  hd  vision  devices  enabling  image  capture  from  the  roadside,  utilizing  machine  learning  and  supported  by  solar  power,  proposed  as  a  realtime  iotbased  system  for  surveillance  of  roadside  loading  and  unloading  bays.  this  can  facilitate  traffic  and  fleet  management  by  implementing  smart  mobility,  thus  achieving  a  highly  efficient  road  network.  this
__label__situationalsurveillance paper  contributes  to  the  utilization  of  iot  technologies  by  developing  the  cvross  in  the  simulink  and  labview  environments.  from  the  setup  of  parameters  to  vehicle  and  object  recognition  and  matching  with  noise  reduction,  the  calculation  of  parking  gaps  and  available  parking  spaces  and,  lastly,  to  information  visualization,  the  cvross,  together  with  stateoftheart  iot  technologies,  is  able  to  provide  road  users  with  realtime  roadside  traffic  information,  such  as  roadside  occupancy  and  vacancy,  thereby  enhancing  the  transparency  of  roadside  activities.  various  reports,  e.g.,  daily  reports,  can  also  be  produced  for  different  parties  via  big  data  analysis.  for  example,  logistics  companies  can  optimize
__label__situationalsurveillance fleet  schedules  based  on  analytical  information.  in  addition,  fuzzy  logic  is  applied  in  evaluating  parking  gaps  and  available  parking  spaces  at  the  roadside,  to  establish  decision  support  in  roadside  operations  for  enhancing  evaluation  accuracy  and  system  flexibility.  this  is  expected  to  help  alleviate  traffic  congestion  by  reducing  waiting  times  for  loading  and  unloading  activities  and  reducing  costs  of  fuel  and  energy  consumption  by  locating  parking  vacancies  and  preventing  circling  around  the  roads.  the  proposed  cvross  solution  facilitates  the  development  and  management  of  a  reliable  and  intelligent  transport  system  in  hong  kong,  resulting  in  the  achievement  of  smart  parking  on  the

__label__situationalsurveillance manage  all  traffic  situations  more  accurately.  this  proposed  system  is  overcoming  the  flaws  of  previous  traffic  management  systems.  the  system  takes  traffic  density  as  input  from  cameras,  which  is  abstracted  from  a  digital  image  processing  technique  and  sensors  data,  resulting  in  output  as  signals  management.  an  algorithm  is  used  to  predict  traffic  density  to  minimize  traffic  congestion.  besides  this,  rfids  are  also  used  to  prioritize  the  emergency  vehicles  like  ambulances,  fire  brigades,  etc.  by  implementing  rfid  tags  in  such  vehicles.  in  the  case  of  emergency  situations,  such  as  an  explosion  or  burning  of  something,  fire  and  smoke  sensors  are  also
__label__situationalsurveillance deployed  on  the  road  to  detect  such  situations.  moreover,  a  mobile  application  is  connected  to  a  centralized  server,  which  communicates  to  the  nearby  rescue  department  about  a  fire  explosion  with  the  location  to  take  further  action.  in  addition,  the  native  user  can  ask  about  future  traffic  conditions  at  the  node.  the  proposed  system  is  validated  by  constructing  a  prototype  and  deploying  it  in  the  city  of  pakistan.  a  web  application  is  also  there  to  provide  useful  information  in  graphical  formats  to  the  higher  authorities  of  the  smart  city,  which  is  fruitful  in  future  road  planning.  fundamental  features  of  designing  an
__label__situationalsurveillance enhanced  traffic  control  system  consist  of  linking  traffic  signals  and  traffic  control  centers  with  gis  enabled  digital  road  map  of  the  town  using  intelligent  computational  power  of  data  analytics  as  a  key  module.  in  this  context,  the  basic  challenge  lies  in  usage  of  real  time  analytics  on  online  traffic  information  and  correctly  applying  it  to  some  basic  traffic  flow.  data  analytics  tools  take  data  from  the  traffic  management  system  and  using  gis  mapping  under  real  time  support,  they  provide  useful  information  to  the  drivers  in  the  vehicles  and  help  reduce  the  traffic  congestion.  additionally,  basic  tourist  information  such  as  visiting
__label__situationalsurveillance places,  parking  area  and  distance  are  also  projected  on  a  real  time  basis  on  large  digital  screens  installed  at  city  centers  entrance  points  to  guide  the  drivers  toward  their  destination.  this  helps  to  save  fuel  and  finally  to  save  a  lot  of  time  spent  in  searching  various  visiting  places.  the  smart  living  style  in  metro  cities  is  also  fulfilled  as  the  environment  becomes  pollution  free  and  more  hygienic.  the  projected  transport  system  has  been  planned  in  a  vehicular  adhoc  networks  vanets  scenario,  as  these  networks  are  becoming  more  of  a  common  technology  in  smart  road  traffic  management  and  control  systems.
__label__situationalsurveillance the  problem  faced  by  smart  cities  in  terms  of  traffic  congestion  issues  can  be  solved  better  using  vanets,  as  there  is  a  network  connectivity  between  the  vehicle  and  the  network  infrastructure.  therefore,  predictable  information  regarding  road  conditions  ahead  and  route  information  can  be  directed  to  the  smart  vehicles  in  transit  and  intelligent  decisions  can  be  made  before  any  problem  occurs.  in  other  ways,  ssla  in  smart  cities  helps  to  reduce  the  problems  of  congestion,  accidents,  crime,  parking  problems  and  population  overhead.  due  to  the  overall  development  of  the  wireless  technology,  their  applications  are  widely  used  and  vehicles  have  been  converted
__label__situationalsurveillance to  smart  vehicles  to  be  accessed  under  smart  traffic  applications.  elbrev4  iscada,  rfid,  camera,  ir,  ultrasonic,  single  board  computer  traffic  congestion  is  a  major  issue.  because  of  this  congestion  problem,  time  taken  for  travelling  will  be  increased.  a  design  was  developed  using  wireless  technology  with  elbrev4  iscada  development  boards  and  sensors.  an  algorithm  was  also  designed  so  that  a  greater  number  of  vehicles  can  pass  through  a  signal.  priorities  would  be  given  to  different  categories  of  vehicles.  emergency  vehicles  like  ambulances,  fire  trucks,  etc.  would  have  top  priority.  next  is  given  to  vips.  next  to  ordinary  vehicles.  priority  was  also
__label__situationalsurveillance given  depending  upon  vehicle  density  on  one  side  of  the  road.  the  road  that  has  a  higher  vehicle  volume  would  get  highest  priority.  rfid  is  mainly  used  to  track  the  objects.  rfid  readers  and  tags  are  used  in  showrooms  so  that  no  one  takes  off  with  any  object  or  material  without  paying  the  bill.  this  rfid  is  also  used  to  track  lost  vehicles.  when  the  unique  id  of  rfid  tags  of  lost  vehicles  are  detected,  then  their  location  where  they  are  found  is  obtained.  the  green  path  for  emergency  vehicles  was  also  designed  to  provide  a  green  signal  so  that
__label__situationalsurveillance the  ambulance  will  get  the  rightofway.  but  the  disadvantage  of  this  is  all  vehicles  will  want  to  start  moving  in  that  open  lane,  which  will  create  even  more  traffic  for  the  ambulance.  in  the  future  advancements  of  traffic  monitoring  signal  tms,  an  ambulance  will  be  able  to  communicate  with  all  base  stations  to  obtain  an  open  lane  to  reach  the  hospital  on  time.  in  this  proposed  methodology,  we  will  provide  solutions  to  congestion,  traffic  clearance  for  emergency  vehicles  and  tracking  of  stolen  vehicles.  and  one  major  plus  point  of  the  system  is  we  have  designed  it  in  automatic  mode  and
__label__situationalsurveillance manual  mode.  in  automatic  mode  depending  upon  sensors  output,  the  decision  can  be  made.  but  in  manual  mode,  the  driver  takes  control.  tms  timing  has  been  developed  by  using  multiple  features  of  hardware  components  in  iot.  traffic  optimization  is  achieved  using  iot  platforms  for  efficient  utilization  of  allocating  varying  times  to  all  traffic  signals  according  to  the  amount  of  vehicles  on  the  road.  tms  will  help  clients  realize  proper  signal  timing  and  traffic  flow  volume  in  their  respective  regions.  nick  kadanvar  works  at  ,  an  innovative  embedded  systems  developer  with  15  years  of  experience  in  design  and  development  of  multiple

__label__situationalsurveillance experiences  and  improved  safety,  among  others.  as  iot  technology  emerges  in  our  society,  we  can  talk  about  two  major  areas:  the  automotive  sector  and  smart  cities.  there  are  many  iot  innovations  that  can  be  applied  to  the  automobile  industry.  on  the  one  hand,  the  introduction  of  new  ideas  to  the  traditional  concept  of  a  car  is  opening  up  new  avenues  for  .  we  are  at  the  beginning  of  a  new  era,  where  we  will  see  a  revolutionary  new  way  of  driving  and  interacting  with  the  environment  around  the  vehicle:  the  smart,  connected  car.  many  large  companies  are  working  in  this
__label__situationalsurveillance field  to  build  a  fully  functioning  selfdriving  car  capable  of  circulating  on  city  streets.  among  the  many  areas  of  development  in  this  sector  are  vehicles  that  can  drive  themselves  without  human  intervention  even  when  there  are  no  lights,  technologies  that  can  avoid  dangerous  situations  and  detect  collisions  that  a  human  driver  would  find  impossible  to  avoid,  information  and  entertainment  services  for  drivers  and  passengers,  applications  for  connected  car  drivers  or  custom  driving  patterns  that  help  us  to  better  understand  driver  behavior  or  analyze  what  happened  in  the  event  of  an  accident.  the  aim  of  all  this  is  to  produce  more
__label__situationalsurveillance efficient  vehicles  that  improve  safety,  provide  better  driving  experiences,  reduce  congestion  and  save  on  fuel.  going  hand  in  hand  with  these  transformations,  is  also  evolving  thanks  to  iot.  trains  and  buses  are  able  to  send  and  receive  realtime  information  about  their  location,  speed,  route,  driver  and  the  number  of  passengers  they  are  carrying,  enabling  public  transport  users  to  get  realtime  information  about  where  their  bus  or  train  is,  and  allowing  bus  and  train  companies  to  improve  their  operations  and  adopt  methods  to  help  them  control  and  optimize  their  fleets.  these  new  technologies  are  even  being  applied  to  adverts  inside  the
__label__situationalsurveillance buses  and  trains,  as  well  as  to  video  surveillance  and  security  systems.  as  part  of  the  smart  cities  environment,  a  city  is  managed  more  intelligently  by  being  connected.  adding  smart  iot  systems  to  services  such  as  garbage,  lighting,  traffic  regulation  and  emergencies  or  irrigation  systems  has  numerous  advantages:  better  air  quality,  more  ecological  sustainability  and  considerable  cost  savings  for  those  cities  that  employ  them.  and  once  the  first  connected  cars  start  to  circulate  in  these  cities,  the  number  of  iot  sensors  and  objects  will  multiply.  on  the  one  hand,  an  ensemble  of  sensors  in  our  cars  will  gather  data  on
__label__situationalsurveillance speed,  acceleration,  temperature,  lights,  tire  pressure,  load  level,  pavement  condition,  pattern  recognition,  cameras,  gps,  etc.  on  the  other  hand,  new  elements  will  appear  in  the  cities  to  interact  with  them,  such  as  markers  to  track  position,  lights  that  vehicle  software  can  recognize  or  smart  signs.  without  a  doubt,  we  stand  before  an  entirely  new  concept  of  vehicle  and  city.  at  teldat  we  have  been  developing  for  some  time  now,  allowing  them  to  stay  connected  to  new  cuttingedge  technologies  at  all  times.  aida  suarez  add  connectivity  to  any  type  of  vehicle  by  ,
__label__situationalsurveillance how  would  a  smart  lightbulb,  an  intelligent  shirt,  a  heart  monitoring  system,  a  tv,  and  a  smartphone,  communicate  with  each  other?  they  dont.  they  speak  different  languages.  although  different  organizations  are  already  working  on  iot  standards,  it  is  still  an  ongoing  process.  in  the  near  future,  there  will  probably  be  thousands  of  different  rules  and  protocols  guiding  communication  in  an  iot  ecosystem.  on  top  of  that,  iot  is  creating  unimaginable  amounts  of  data.  we  might  have  already  heard  the  statistics.  a  forecasts  that  by  the  end  of  2019,  a  total  of  14.2  billion  things  will  be  connected  to  the  internet.
__label__situationalsurveillance and  this  number  will  increase  to  25  billion  by  2021.  imagine  billions  of  devices  at  the  edge  with  different  standards  sending  information  to  the  internet.  this  complex  environment  with  massive  amounts  of  data  is  making  iot  devices  communication  challenging  and  slow  for  now  and  in  the  future,  the  iot  devices  use  a  gateway  as  a  central  hub  to  drop  sensed  knowledge  and  communicate  with  external  networks.  in  telecommunications,  the  primary  purpose  of  a  gateway  is  to  provide  a  bridge  between  different  types  of  communication  technologies.  these  technologies  can  vary  in  terms  of  connectivity  types,  interfaces,  or  protocols.  for  example,  your
__label__situationalsurveillance internet  gateway  at  home  connects  your  local  area  network  lan  with  your  internet  service  provider  isp.  this  gateway  links  the  wan  of  the  isp  through  technologies  like  ppp  or  hdlc  with  your  lan  with  tcp/ip.  the  iot  gateway  follows  the  same  principle  of  bridging  communications  for  different  technologies.  it  creates  a  bridge  between  the  iot  sensors/actuators  and  the  internet.  the  iot  gateway  aggregates  all  data,  translates  sensors  protocols,  and  preprocess  the  data  before  sending  it.  the  iot  devices  connect  to  the  iot  gateway  using  shortrange  wireless  transmission  modes  such  as  bluetooth  le,  zigbee,  zwave,  or  longrange  like  lte,  ltem,  wifi,
__label__situationalsurveillance and  then  it  links  them  to  the  internet  public  cloud  through  ethernet  lan  or  fiber  optics  wan  hdlc/ppp.  the  iot  gateway  understands  these  transmission  modes  and  data  mqtt,  coap,  amqp,  dds,  websocket  protocols  and  can  translate  them  to  other  protocols  that  the  data  systems  needs.  most  iot  devices  in  networks  nowadays  are  capable  of  aggregating  data.  for  example,  sensors  in  car  traffic  can  aggregate  data  and  send  it  to  an  ai  analysis  service  in  the  cloud.  but  to  reach  the  cloud,  the  sensors  must  first  send  all  this  raw  data  to  the  iot  gateway.  the  iot  gateway  follows  this  simple
__label__situationalsurveillance process.  the  iot  gateway  provides  softwaredriven  capabilities  at  the  edge  network,  which  is  known  as  edge  computing.  the  gateway  uses  this  power  at  the  edge  to  deal  with  the  massive  amounts  of  data  that  iot  sensors  generate.  if  all  this  data  had  to  be  transferred  by  the  gateway  including  junk  and  unnecessary  data,  the  latency  in  communication  would  be  significantly  affected.  in  order  to  reduce  this  data  overload,  an  iot  gateway  uses  edge  computing  capabilities  to  collect,  analyze,  and  declutter  these  large  volumes  of  data.  the  iot  gateway  can  preprocess  and  filtering  out  data  that  is  not  needed  at  the
__label__situationalsurveillance endpoint  so  that  there  is  less  data  to  be  forwarded.  an  iot  smart  toy  called  was  banned  in  germany  because  it  was  labeled  as  an  espionage  device.  the  toy  had  no  security  standards  whatsoever.  a  person  could  hack  it,  and  listen  to  entire  conversations  around  the  doll,  and  even  speak  through  it.  but  this  is  not  the  only  case;  there  are  also  home  thermostats,  selfdriving  cars,  video  surveillance,  and  even  entire  food  factories,  being  hacked.  an  iot  gateway  provides  the  first  line  of  defense.  it  reduces  exposure  to  the  internet  and  other  external  parties.  all  iot  devices  must  be  connected
__label__situationalsurveillance to  the  gateway  to  communicate,  which  makes  it,  the  first  target  to  an  attack.  without  a  gateway  in  the  middle  of  communication,  the  entire  iot  ecosystem  is  at  risk.  iot  is  making  driving  safe,  through  sensors  deployed  in  roads,  traffic  lights,  and  crosswalks.  but  these  sensors  need  to  be  highly  autonomous  in  terms  of  energy.  they  need  longrange  connectivity  to  send  data  to  cellular  towers  or  satellite,  which  consumes  large  amounts  of  power.  applications  such  as  this  one,  usually  fail  because  sensors/actuators  have  limited  battery  life.  in  other  cases,  even  energyintensive  technologies  like  bluetooth  and  wifi  are  not  supported  by
__label__situationalsurveillance most  of  these  iot  sensors.  but  a  nearby  iot  gateway  connected  to  the  grid  can  serve  as  a  bridge  to  shorten  those  signal  ranges  and  manage  all  sensors  communication.  with  this  approach,  the  sensors  only  need  a  shortdistance  signal  range,  so  they  use  low  power  radios  and  thus  save  precious  battery  life.  the  iot  sensors  job  is  to  collect  data  from  the  external  environment  and  send  it  to  an  analyzer  in  the  cloud  or  server.  in  an  application  such  as  safe  driving,  the  sensed  data  from  a  wide  arrange  of  sensors,  could  be  movement,  light,  videocameras,  etc.  but  the  content
__label__situationalsurveillance of  the  data  is  irrelevant  to  the  communications  mechanism.  all  that  a  communication  protocol  needs  to  do  is  make  devices  communicate  with  each  other  efficiently  and  send  their  data  to  a  central  analysis  platform.  but  if  there  will  be  25  billion  iot  devices  by  2021,  there  will  likely  be  a  broad  ecosystem  of  transmission  protocols,  rules,  and  standards.  an  iot  gateway  should  be  able  to  understand  many  of  these  protocols  and  translate  communication  from  the  sensor  to  the  cloud.  below  are  some  examples  of  realuse  case  scenarios  where  iot  gateways  could  be  used.  every  case  comes  with  an  example  of
__label__situationalsurveillance an  iot  gateway  appliance.  there  are  tons  of  different  classes,  and  types  of  iot  gateways,  but  the  ones  here  are  appropriate  for  each  case.  iot  can  help  the  shipping  container  industry  by  keeping  track  of  every  container  and  improving  their  security.  the  challenge  is  that  shipping  containers  are  usually  located  around  wet  and  temperaturewide  areas.  an  iot  gateway  for  this  type  of  industry  needs  to  be  designed  for  low  power  consumption,  high  processing  performance,  security  capabilities,  and  ready  for  extreme  environments.  iot  imaging  devices  within  the  healthcare  sector  can  help  radiologists  adjust  external  factors  such  as  the  light  setting  of

__label__situationalsurveillance computer  vision  and  pattern  recognition  techniques.  in  this  paper,  we  present  a  novel  intelligent  surveillance  system  used  for  the  management  of  road  vehicles  based  on  intelligent  visual  internet  of  things  iviot.  the  system  has  the  ability  to  extract  the  vehicle  visual  tags  on  the  urban  roads;  in  other  words,  it  can  label  any  vehicle  by  means  of  computer  vision  and  therefore  can  easily  recognize  vehicles  with  visual  tags.  the  nodes  designed  in  the  system  can  be  installed  not  only  on  the  urban  roads  for  providing  basic  information  but  also  on  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles  for  providing  mobility  support  and  improving
__label__situationalsurveillance sensing  coverage.  visual  tags  mentioned  in  this  paper  consist  of  license  plate  number,  vehicle  color,  and  vehicle  type  and  have  several  additional  properties,  such  as  passing  spot  and  passing  moment.  moreover,  we  present  a  fast  and  efficient  image  haze  removal  method  to  deal  with  haze  weather  condition.  the  experiment  results  show  that  the  designed  road  vehicle  monitoring  system  achieves  an  average  realtime  tracking  accuracy  of  85.80  under  different  conditions.  in  the  past  decades,  with  the  increasing  of  vehicles,  traffic  management  is  facing  an  accumulation  of  evergrowing  pressure;  more  and  more  intelligent  surveillance  systems  employing  computer  vision  and  pattern  recognition  techniques
__label__situationalsurveillance have  appeared.  intelligent  surveillance  system  can  provide  intelligent  video  analysis,  such  as  the  cases  of  jumping  the  red  light  or  illegally  turning  around,  so  as  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  traffic  management.  therefore,  intelligent  surveillance  technology  is  one  of  the  hot  issues  in  the  field  of  computer  vision.  up  to  now,  most  of  the  traditional  intelligent  surveillance  systems  only  employ  automatic  license  plate  recognition  alpr  in  specific  occasions  e.g.,  automatic  toll  collection,  unattended  parking  lots,  and  congestion  pricing  .  although  such  systems  have  proven  to  be  very  useful,  they  are  usually  deployed  as  an  isolated  application  only  under  restricted  and
__label__situationalsurveillance particular  environment  settings.  few  of  them  have  the  capability  of  large  scale  data  mining  and  data  transmission  to  achieve  the  goal  of  intelligent  city.  presented  in  was  a  system  aiming  at  bringing  together  automatic  license  plate  recognition  engines  and  cloud  computing  technology  in  order  to  realize  massive  data  analysis  and  enable  the  detection  and  tracking  of  a  target  vehicle  in  a  city  with  a  given  license  plate  number,  but  in  it  is  not  quite  reliable  to  identify  a  vehicle  only  by  the  license  plate  number.  because  vehicles  with  similar  license  plate  numbers  appearing  in  the  same  camera  at  the  same
__label__situationalsurveillance time  are  likely  to  be  recognized  as  the  same  vehicle  due  to  the  possible  error  of  the  character  classifier,  wrong  tracking  is  unavoidable  in  this  case.  and  the  specific  algorithms  towards  adverse  weather  are  all  not  considered  in  .  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  novel  intelligent  surveillance  system  used  for  the  management  of  road  vehicles  based  on  intelligent  visual  internet  of  things  iviot.  the  designed  intelligent  visual  sensors  of  iviot  have  the  ability  to  extract  the  visual  tags  of  vehicles  on  the  urban  roads.  among  them,  some  sensors  are  installed  on  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles  to  provide  mobility  support
__label__situationalsurveillance and  improve  sensing  coverage.  a  visual  tag  is  one  of  the  most  important  components  of  iviot  which  can  identify  vehicles  more  accurately,  because  it  not  only  bears  the  information  of  license  plate  number  but  also  bears  the  information  of  vehicle  color,  vehicle  type,  and  several  additional  properties,  such  as  passing  spot  and  passing  moment.  the  estimated  route  of  the  target  vehicle  can  be  chronologically  linked  with  the  properties  of  its  visual  tag  e.g.,  passing  spot  and  passing  moment  which  can  be  associated  and  mined  from  the  central  database.  furthermore,  haze  weather,  the  most  common  adverse  condition  of  surveillance  systems,  is
__label__situationalsurveillance considered  in  our  system.  in  2009,  the  algorithm  based  on  dark  channel  prior  proposed  by  he  et  al.  has  achieved  a  great  effect  on  image  haze  removal,  but  its  optimization  of  transmission  map  was  high  computationally  complex  and  timeconsuming.  therefore,  we  propose  a  fast  image  haze  removal  algorithm  which  can  not  only  meet  the  realtime  requirement  but  also  ensure  the  quality  of  the  image  haze  removal.  this  intelligent  surveillance  system  is  very  useful  to  the  traffic  control  department  and  can  greatly  increase  the  public  security  of  our  society.  the  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  section  briefly  introduces
__label__situationalsurveillance the  core  technology  and  main  features  of  iviot  and  the  fields  in  which  they  can  be  applied.  section  presents  a  detailed  method  to  deal  with  the  haze  weather  condition.  sections  and  dwell  on  the  algorithm  of  extracting  the  vehicle  visual  tags.  among  them,  section  mainly  describes  the  fundamental  idea  of  the  proposed  license  plate  recognition  algorithm,  and  section  mainly  describes  the  other  properties  of  vehicle  visual  tags,  including  vehicle  color  and  vehicle  type.  section  presents  the  overall  evaluations  and  discussions  of  the  system  in  practice.  section  draws  conclusions  and  proposes  future  work.  nowadays,  intelligent  visual  internet  of  things  iviot  is
__label__situationalsurveillance well  known  and  plays  an  imperative  role  in  the  entire  paradigm  of  internet  systems  .  iviot  is  not  only  an  important  part  of  a  new  generational  information  technology  but  also  an  upgraded  version  of  internet  of  things  iot.  iviot  has  the  capability  of  perceiving  people,  vehicles,  and  objects  via  visual  sensors,  information  transmission,  and  intelligent  visual  analysis.  so,  any  object  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  which  is  easy  for  information  exchange  and  communication.  it  can  achieve  functions  of  the  intelligent  identification,  location,  tracking,  monitoring,  and  management  for  objects.  one  of  the  most  important  technologies  of  iviot  is  intelligent  visual
__label__situationalsurveillance tags,  just  like  rfid  tags.  but  the  most  significant  difference  between  visual  tags  and  rfid  tags  is  that  visual  tags  can  identify  objects  from  a  further  distance  and  break  the  limit  of  distance  and  range.  visual  tag  is  a  relatively  virtual  tag;  it  contains  a  variety  of  objects  properties  e.g.,  its  name,  id,  color,  identity,  and  locations.  as  depicted  in  figure  ,  iviot  labels  people,  vehicles,  and  objects  by  means  of  vision.  because  each  object  should  have  a  unique  visual  tag,  visual  tags  will  be  sent  to  the  central  database  when  extracted  which  could  be  used  for  subsequent  analysis.  another
__label__situationalsurveillance important  technology  of  iviot  is  intelligent  visual  information  mining;  the  visual  tags  of  people,  vehicles,  and  objects  can  be  combined  and  extended  to  many  fields  e.g.,  publicsecurityoriented  field,  for  the  purposes  of  the  tracking  of  a  criminal  suspect  or  a  stolen  vehicle.  to  assume  that  there  are  lots  of  cameras  deployed  in  various  locations  of  roadsides,  each  camera  identifies  vehicles  that  appeared  in  it  through  extracting  visual  tags.  some  properties  of  the  same  visual  tag,  such  as  time  and  locations,  can  be  associated  and  mined  from  the  central  database,  and  the  estimated  route  of  the  target  vehicle  can  be  chronologically
__label__situationalsurveillance linked.  so,  it  is  very  helpful  to  the  traffic  control  department.  figure  1:  in  this  paper,  we  design  the  intelligent  visual  sensor  nodes  which  can  be  linked  to  wireless  network,  extract  vehicle  visual  tags  on  the  roads,  and  transmit  video  streaming.  the  nodes  can  be  installed  not  only  on  the  urban  roads  for  providing  basic  information  but  also  on  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles  for  providing  the  mobility  support  and  improving  sensing  coverage.  they  can  effectively  help  the  law  enforcement  officers  discover  the  blacklist  vehicles  under  the  circumstance  of  nonaffecting  traffic  order  e.g.,  stolen  vehicles,  wanted  vehicles,  and  other  illegal  vehicles.
__label__situationalsurveillance all  the  nodes  distributed  on  the  urban  roads  and  on  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles  together  construct  a  large  scale  iviot.  the  architecture  of  iviot  for  road  vehicle  monitoring  in  this  paper  is  shown  in  figure  .  iviot  in  our  work  does  not  need  a  high  broadband  wireless  link,  because  each  node  has  the  capability  of  intelligent  video  analysis,  and  the  function  of  transmitting  video  streaming  is  conducted  only  when  requested.  but  the  system  snake  eyes  in  needs  a  high  broadband  wireless  link  between  the  camera  network  and  the  cloud  servers;  because  they  retrieve  videos  from  dvrs  simultaneously  for  intelligent  analysis,
__label__situationalsurveillance it  is  a  high  expense  on  broadband  spending  and  is  very  sensitive  to  network  congestion.  figure  2:  in  order  to  give  a  concrete  application  model  to  our  iviot  framework,  we  divided  iviot  into  three  layers:  perception  layer,  network  layer,  and  application  layer  ,  .  the  perception  layer  consists  of  highresolution  cameras,  embedded  processors,  gps,  network  adapter,  and  so  forth.  the  main  function  of  perception  layer  is  perception  and  identification  of  vehicles  on  the  urban  roads  and  collecting  the  unique  visual  tags  of  vehicles  for  subsequent  analysis.  the  network  layer  consists  of  converged  network  formed  by  all  kinds  of  communication  network
__label__situationalsurveillance and  internet.  we  add  a  special  thread  which  can  transmit  the  data  of  visual  tags  to  the  central  database  by  socket  programming  and  transmit  the  video  streaming  via  ip  network  when  requested.  the  application  layer  is  used  to  receive  the  data  information  and  analyze  it  into  useful  information  for  administrators.  in  our  work,  the  estimated  route  of  the  target  vehicle  can  be  chronologically  linked  with  the  properties  of  its  visual  tag  e.g.,  passing  spot  and  passing  moment  which  can  be  associated  and  mined  from  the  central  database,  so  all  the  vehicles  on  the  roads  can  be  monitored  and  tracked.  moreover,
__label__situationalsurveillance the  realtime  video  streaming  can  be  acquired  from  any  node  if  necessary.  the  software  architecture  of  transmitting  video  streaming  and  data  e.g.,  visual  tags  on  the  embedded  processor  of  each  node  is  shown  in  figure  ;  it  is  based  on  the  open  source  project  mjpgstreamer  on  linux.  we  can  view  realtime  video  streaming  of  any  node  on  request.  mjpgstreamer  is  used  for  capturing  images  from  camera  and  transmitting  images  in  the  form  of  streaming  via  ip  network;  it  can  take  advantage  of  some  cameras  hardware  compression  to  provide  a  solution  of  lightweight  consumption  of  cpu  because  it  does  not  need
__label__situationalsurveillance lots  of  time  on  frame  compression.  mjpgstreamer  consists  of  input  plugins  and  output  plugins;  it  is  just  like  adhesive  which  can  connect  input  and  output  plugins  on  request.  only  the  two  plugins,  inputuvc  for  capturing  images  and  outputhttp  for  transmitting  video  streaming,  are  needed  in  our  work,  and  we  add  a  specified  socket  thread  for  data  transmitting.  thus,  we  greatly  reduce  the  development  cycle  via  mjpgstreamer.  figure  3:  the  imaging  process  of  traffic  video  streaming  is  often  affected  by  many  factors  e.g.,  haze  weather,  low  illumination,  and  the  noise  of  the  imaging  equipment.  these  factors  together  make  the  traffic  images
__label__situationalsurveillance show  some  adverse  situations  e.g.,  degradation,  noise,  and  fuzzy  situation  and  therefore  result  in  the  low  accuracy  of  license  plate  location  and  character  recognition.  in  this  section,  the  most  common  adverse  condition  of  surveillance  systems  is  considered,  namely,  haze  weather  condition.  currently,  the  algorithms  of  image  haze  removal  are  mainly  divided  into  two  categories:  the  enhancement  of  haze  image  based  on  image  processing  and  the  restoration  of  haze  image  based  on  physical  model.  although  image  enhancement  algorithm  can  effectively  improve  the  contrast  and  highlight  the  details,  the  diversity  of  depth  of  field  in  the  haze  image  is  not  considered,  which
__label__situationalsurveillance makes  it  difficult  to  achieve  good  results.  meanwhile,  since  image  restoration  algorithm  based  on  physical  model  has  a  strong  pertinence,  it  can  achieve  an  ideal  result  of  image  haze  removal  and  a  more  natural  image.  in  computer  vision  and  computer  graphics,  the  description  of  a  haze  image  can  use  the  accepted  atmospheric  scattering  model  which  is  as  follows:  where  is  the  haze  image,  is  the  expected  haze  removal  image,  is  the  global  atmospheric  light,  and  is  the  transmission  map.  the  goal  of  haze  removal  is  to  recover  ,  ,  and  from  .  in  2009,  the  algorithm  based  on  dark  channel
__label__situationalsurveillance prior  proposed  by  he  et  al.  has  achieved  a  great  effect  on  image  haze  removal.  the  dark  channel  prior  theory  presented  in  shows  that  at  least  one  color  channel  has  very  low  intensity  at  some  pixels  in  most  of  nonsky  hazefree  images.  for  an  image  ,  its  dark  channel  prior  can  be  defined  as  where  is  a  color  channel  of  and  is  a  local  patch  centered  at  .  when  is  a  hazefree  image,  the  intensity  of  tends  to  be  zero  except  for  the  sky  region.  for  a  haze  image,  the  initial  transmission  map  and  the  global  atmospheric  light  can  be
__label__situationalsurveillance calculated  from  the  dark  channel  prior.  because  the  initial  transmission  map  contains  bad  block  effects,  it  cannot  well  preserve  the  edges  of  the  original  image.  in  order  to  get  more  precise  transmission  map  ,  used  the  method  of  soft  matting  proposed  by  levin  et  al.  to  refine  the  transmission;  the  formula  is  as  follows:  where  the  first  item  is  the  smooth  item,  the  second  item  is  the  data  item,  is  the  matting  laplacian  matrix,  and  is  a  regularization  parameter.  the  expected  haze  removal  image  can  then  be  calculated  with  the  optimized  transmission  map,  the  global  atmospheric  light  ,  and  the
__label__situationalsurveillance haze  image  .  although  has  a  good  effect  on  image  haze  removal,  the  process  of  soft  matting  is  very  slow.  aiming  at  this  problem,  we  propose  a  fast  image  haze  removal  algorithm  for  our  system  based  on  dark  channel  prior.  the  algorithm  not  only  can  meet  the  realtime  requirement  but  also  can  ensure  the  quality  of  the  image  haze  removal.  we  abandon  the  soft  matting  method  in  ;  instead,  we  adopt  the  idea  of  function  construction  to  obtain  the  more  precise  transmission  map  which  is  also  suitable  for  sky  regions  smoothing  based  on  the  median  filter.  then,  by  further  optimization
__label__situationalsurveillance experiments,  we  find  that  using  the  downsampling  haze  image  to  calculate  the  transmission  map  and  the  upsampling  transmission  map  to  recover  the  expected  image  can  not  only  achieve  almost  the  same  good  result  as  the  method  in  but  also  speed  up  transmission  map  calculating  a  lot.  accordingly,  the  whole  flowchart  for  the  fast  image  haze  removal  algorithm  in  this  paper  is  shown  in  figure  .  figure  4:  our  fast  image  haze  removal  algorithm  contains  four  main  steps.  4x  downsample  the  input  haze  image  and  calculate  the  dark  channel  image.  smooth  dark  channel  using  median  filter.  obtain  the  more  precise  transmission
__label__situationalsurveillance map  using  function  construction.  4x  upsample  transmission  map  and  calculate  the  haze  removal  image.  according  to  the  atmospheric  scattering  model,  the  accurate  transmission  map  can  be  expressed  as  and  the  transmission  map  achieved  by  dark  channel  prior  assumption  is  the  method  of  dark  channel  prior  process  used  in  this  paper  is  the  median  filter  algorithm  by  tarel  in  ,  which  can  keep  the  edge  feature  of  the  original  image  well.  because  is  not  approximately  equal  to  zero  in  the  sky  region,  we  optimize  the  transmission  map  based  on  function  construction  in  step  3  and  calculate  the  final  transmission  map  according
__label__situationalsurveillance to  the  following  formula:  where  should  satisfy  the  following  conditions.  a  in  the  region  where  the  intensities  of  the  transmission  map  are  low,  the  difference  between  and  is  very  small,  so  should  tend  to  one.  b  in  the  region  where  the  intensities  of  the  transmission  map  are  close  to  the  atmospheric  light  sky  region,  is  much  larger  than  ,  so  should  tend  to  zero.  c  in  the  region  where  the  intensities  of  the  transmission  map  are  low,  the  gradient  change  of  is  smaller,  and,  in  the  region  where  the  intensities  of  the  transmission  map  are  high,  the  gradient  change  of
__label__situationalsurveillance is  bigger.  according  to  the  above  requirements,  the  function  constructed  in  this  paper  is  as  follows:  and  the  function  curve  of  is  shown  in  figure  .  figure  5:  after  the  above  processing,  the  haze  removal  image  can  be  recovered  by  where  is  0.1  to  keep  some  haze  for  the  distant  view  and  to  avoid  that  the  denominator  may  be  equal  to  zero.  because  the  resulting  haze  removal  images  tend  to  be  dark  overall,  the  luminance  needs  to  be  adjusted.  the  luminance  matrix  of  an  image  is  defined  as  follows:  human  visual  system  is  sensitive  to  luminance  changes,  and  the  sensitivity
__label__situationalsurveillance is  proportional  to  luminance.  for  this  reason,  we  can  make  the  low  luminance  details  clearer  by  enlarging  the  range  of  the  low  luminance  region  and  compressing  the  range  of  the  high  luminance  region.  although  the  range  of  the  high  luminance  region  is  compressed,  it  does  not  affect  image  quality  for  the  increase  of  human  visual  sensitivity.  using  the  logarithmic  function  as  the  main  histogram  stretching  function  can  satisfy  the  human  subjective  visual  characteristic.  the  stretching  function  is  defined  as  where  is  from  2  to  and  is  the  number  of  histogram  bins  not  equal  to  zero.  in  order  to  ensure  that
__label__situationalsurveillance the  color  is  not  distorted,  we  finally  use  formula  to  recover  color  after  stretching  the  histogram  of  the  luminance  matrix  :  where  is  the  matrix  after  the  histogram  stretching  and  is  the  channel  of  the  haze  removal  image.  in  order  to  verify  the  validity  and  the  time  performance  of  the  proposed  algorithm,  we  have  processed  hundreds  of  haze  images  and  compared  our  algorithm  with  the  algorithms  proposed  in  ,  in  the  aspects  of  quality  and  speed.  the  speed  test  is  conducted  on  the  embedded  processor  used  in  our  system.  the  comparison  of  quality  is  shown  in  figures  and  ,  and
__label__situationalsurveillance the  comparison  of  speed  is  shown  in  table  .  from  figures  and  ,  we  can  see  that  the  results  obtained  by  ,  both  tend  to  be  overall  darkened  and  the  sky  regions  are  of  slight  distortion.  and  the  haze  removal  result  of  is  not  clear.  the  result  of  our  algorithm  is  the  closest  to  that  of  ,  which  adaptively  adjusts  the  image  luminance.  moreover,  from  table  we  can  see  that  our  algorithm  can  meet  the  realtime  need,  while  the  algorithms  proposed  in  ,  cannot.  table  1:  figure  6:  figure  7:  license  plate  number  is  a  unique  sign  of  the  vehicle,
__label__situationalsurveillance so  license  plate  recognition  is  an  important  part  of  vehicle  recognition  in  modern  intelligent  surveillance  systems.  in  this  section,  we  describe  the  architecture  of  the  algorithm  of  extracting  the  license  plate  number  which  is  the  most  important  property  of  vehicle  visual  tags.  whether  license  plate  can  be  successfully  located  is  undoubtedly  a  prerequisite  for  license  recognition,  so  we  need  as  much  as  possible  to  improve  the  discrimination  of  license  plate  in  the  image  for  the  purpose  of  license  plate  location.  in  china,  there  are  many  special  characteristics  of  license  plate  itself  e.g.,  the  obvious  rectangular  shape,  four  background  colors  blue,
__label__situationalsurveillance yellow,  black,  and  white,  the  interval  arrangement  of  characters,  and  the  depth  difference  between  background  color  and  characters  color.  therefore,  the  main  characteristics  considered  in  license  plate  location  are  texture  ,  aspect  ratio,  and  color  .  in  this  paper,  we  first  realize  the  feature  enhancement  of  license  plate,  generate  the  possible  region  of  the  license  plate,  and,  finally,  locate  it.  the  flowchart  for  the  license  plate  locating  is  shown  in  figure  .  figure  8:  the  main  flow  contains  three  parts.  generate  possible  region  of  the  license  plate,  horizontal  sharpening,  binary,  vertical  dilation,  and  horizontal  dilation.  cut  the  unnecessary  white  segment.
__label__situationalsurveillance judge  the  final  location  of  the  license  plate:  use  the  information  of  aspect  ratio  and  color  statistics  of  the  license  plate  to  screen  the  plate  regions.  in  particular,  to  deal  with  the  circumstance  that  the  color  of  license  plate  and  vehicles  body  is  similar,  this  paper  uses  edge  detection  with  feature  color  to  judge  the  final  region  of  the  license  plate  from  several  possible  regions.  there  are  two  commonly  used  color  models  in  digital  image  processing  e.g.,  rgb  and  hsv.  in  the  space  of  rgb,  the  brightness  of  the  three  components  ,  ,  and  changes  with  the  difference  of  light
__label__situationalsurveillance intensity,  so  it  is  unsuitable  for  license  plate  location,  while  the  space  of  hsv  is  not  affected  by  light  intensity  and  thus  can  be  applied  in  license  plate  location.  hsv  model  is  first  promoted  by  alvy  ray  smith  in  1978.  it  is  a  nonlinear  transformation  of  rgb  model.  the  transform  from  ,  ,  to  ,  ,  is  where  ,  ,  and  are  the  three  components  of  rgb  model,  ,  ,  and  are  the  three  components  of  hsv  model,  max  represents  ,  and  min  represents  .  in  this  paper,  we  only  discuss  the  circumstance  of  bluewhite  license  plate  and  set  the
__label__situationalsurveillance constraint  of  color  blue,  and  ,  and  the  constraint  of  color  white,  and  .  consider  an  image  and  make  a  count  on  blue  and  white  pixels  in  the  window  centered  by  according  to  the  constraint  of  colors  blue  and  white;  the  method  for  judging  whether  there  is  a  bluewhite  edge  is  as  follows:  assume  a  twodimensional  array  which  is  used  for  saving  the  edge  detected  image  and  initialize  to  zero.  if  any  condition  above  is  satisfied,  we  can  regard  ,  ,  and  as  the  bluewhite  edge,  setting  .  we  use  this  window  to  traverse  the  candidate  roi  at  the  last
__label__situationalsurveillance of  step  3  and  judge  the  roi  region  which  has  the  most  abundant  information  of  bluewhite  texture  as  the  final  region  of  the  license  plate.  so,  this  method  can  rule  out  the  pseudoregion  of  the  license  plate  effectively,  improving  the  accuracy  of  license  plate  location.  figure  shows  the  whole  effective  images  of  license  plate  location.  figure  9:  there  are  many  common  methods  of  license  plate  character  segmentation  e.g.,  blob  analysis  ,  connected  domain  analysis  ,  and  projection  histogram  segmentation.  every  method  has  its  own  advantages  and  disadvantages.  the  morphology  method  should  recognize  the  sizes  of  characters  first.  the  segmentation  projection
__label__situationalsurveillance histogram  method  should  recognize  the  orientation  of  the  license  plate,  and  noise  has  a  great  impact  on  the  accuracy  of  character  segmentation.  in  this  paper,  a  hybrid  of  connected  domain  analysis  and  projection  histogram  segmentation  is  considered  for  license  plate  character  segmentation.  the  algorithm  of  mathematical  morphology  and  radon  transformation  ,  is  used  for  the  slant  correction  of  the  license  plate.  because  it  is  not  the  key  issue  in  this  paper,  there  is  no  more  tautology  here.  license  plate  character  segmentation  in  this  paper  contains  two  main  steps.  execute  the  algorithm  of  connected  component  labeling  in  the  region  of  license
__label__situationalsurveillance plate  and  eliminate  those  connected  components  according  to  the  information  of  their  area  and  minimum  bounding  rectangle  e.g.,  the  area,  the  width,  and  the  height  of  the  minimum  bounding  rectangle  are  too  small.  after  the  above  algorithm,  noise  and  obviously  impossible  regions  are  removed.  it  provides  a  good  condition  for  the  subsequent  algorithm  of  projection.  then,  the  leftright  boundaries  of  some  characters  can  be  acquired  by  vertical  projection.  for  those  characters  eliminated  erroneously,  their  leftright  boundaries  can  be  judged  according  to  the  prior  information  of  the  license  plate  e.g.,  the  total  number  of  characters  and  the  interval  between  each  character.
__label__situationalsurveillance the  effective  images  in  the  process  of  character  segmentation  are  shown  in  figure  .  figure  10:  for  the  recognition  of  characters  on  license  plate,  we  use  the  classifier  of  support  vector  machine  svm.  according  to  the  features  of  chinese  license  plate,  four  types  of  classifiers  are  constructed  in  this  paper,  including  chinese  characters  classifier,  26  alphabetical  characters  classifier,  10  numerals  classifier,  and  36  alphabetsnumerals  classifier.  before  training  the  classifier,  the  selection  and  extraction  of  characters  features  are  crucial.  for  a  target  object  image,  the  shape  feature  of  its  profile  curve  can  be  described  by  shape  context  ,  and  the  shape
__label__situationalsurveillance context  descriptor  is  tolerant  to  all  common  shape  deformations.  so,  we  use  shape  context  as  the  feature  descriptor  of  characters  in  this  paper.  in  this  part,  we  introduce  the  steps  of  feature  extraction,  including  logpolar  transformation  and  computing  logpolar  histogram.  1  logpolar  transformation  .  generally  the  locations  of  pixels  in  an  image  can  be  represented  in  cartesian  coordinates  and  also  can  be  represented  in  polar  coordinates  .  for  the  selected  origin  of  coordinates,  they  satisfy  the  following  relations:  2  computing  logpolar  histogram  .  according  to  the  definition  of  shape  context,  we  need  to  sample  the  edge  points  of  the  object
__label__situationalsurveillance and  compute  shape  context  of  every  point.  for  one  points  shape  context,  we  regard  this  point  as  coordinate  origin  and  compute  logpolar  histogram  in  logpolar  space  e.g.,  consider  one  specified  point  on  the  contour  and  set  its  corresponding  logpolar  coordinates  ,  dividing  into  60  bin  regions;  then,  compute  its  logpolar  histogram.  the  corresponding  mathematical  formula  is  as  follows:  where  represents  the  th  bin  of  the  divided  logpolar  coordinates,  represents  the  sampling  points  of  the  edge  of  the  object,  and  represents  the  number  of  s  in  the  th  bin.  the  computation  of  shape  context  is  shown  in  figure  .  figure  11:
__label__situationalsurveillance the  flow  of  training  is  as  follows.  a  extract  the  features  of  shape  context  from  the  dataset  of  vehicles  collected  by  our  lab.  b  send  all  the  feature  vectors  and  corresponding  labels  to  the  training  interface  of  svm.  c  employ  radical  basis  function  rbf  as  the  kernel  function  of  svm  to  train  the  four  types  of  classifiers.  some  initial  parameters  in  the  algorithm  of  svm  are  crucial  to  the  accuracy  of  character  recognition  e.g.,  and  .  i.e.,  penalty  coefficient  represents  the  number  of  penalties  added  for  the  wrongclassified  samples.  the  larger  the  is,  the  fewer  the  wrongclassified  samples  are,  but
__label__situationalsurveillance the  phenomenon  of  overfitting  is  far  graver.  the  smaller  the  is,  the  more  the  wrongclassified  samples  are;  thus,  the  generated  model  is  not  accurate.  from  the  experiences  in  license  plate  recognition,  when  the  value  of  is  1,  the  accuracy  of  recognition  is  very  low,  and  when  the  value  of  is  10,  the  effect  of  recognition  is  the  best.  when  adding  the  value  of  from  50  to  100,  the  accuracy  of  recognition  is  essentially  unchanged.  so  we  choose  10  as  the  best  parameter  of  and  fix  the  value  of  to  find  the  best  parameter  of  when  the  accuracy  of  character  recognition
__label__situationalsurveillance is  the  highest  by  setting  ,  5,  10,  15,  20,  50,  100,  200,  300,  400,  500  successively.  we  divide  our  dataset  containing  5000  vehicle  images  into  two  parts,  4000  vehicle  images  for  training  and  1000  vehicle  images  for  testing.  the  model  parameters  of  four  types  of  classifiers  in  this  paper  are  shown  in  tables  to  .  table  2:  table  3:  table  4:  table  5:  after  experiment  of  the  chosen  model  parameters,  we  find  that  the  recognition  accuracy  of  four  types  of  classifiers  comes  to  a  peak  value  when  the  value  of  is  around  10.  the  best  model  parameters  of  four
__label__situationalsurveillance types  of  classifiers  we  choose  are  shown  in  table  .  table  6:  although  only  the  license  plate  number  is  enough  to  identify  a  vehicle,  in  practice  the  vision  based  license  plate  number  recognition  can  provide  the  wrong  information  due  to  poor  image  quality  or  a  fake  plate.  the  recognition  of  vehicle  color  and  type  is  an  important  development  direction  in  the  field  of  intelligent  transportation.  it  enriches  the  feature  information  of  vehicle  recognition  and  has  great  significance  on  hitting  the  fakeplate  vehicles  and  other  criminal  behaviors.  in  this  section,  we  explain  how  we  extract  effective  features  and  design  suitable  classifiers
__label__situationalsurveillance for  the  recognition  of  vehicle  color  and  type.  long  time  ago,  many  color  space  models  were  put  forward  for  various  reasons.  each  color  space  model  has  its  separate  application  range  and  has  its  own  advantages  and  disadvantages.  in  this  paper,  we  divide  the  colors  of  vehicles  into  seven  types,  including  white,  silver,  black,  yellow,  green,  red,  and  blue.  through  the  indepth  study  of  color  representation,  we  propose  a  novel  method  that  combines  the  color  space  hsv  and  lab  and  uses  classifier  of  svm  to  overcome  the  erroneous  recognition  of  similar  color.  consider  that  vehicles  have  various  components  which  may  have
__label__situationalsurveillance different  colors;  we  are  only  interested  in  the  color  of  vehicles  body  rather  than  the  colors  of  other  parts  such  as  windows  or  wheels.  we  choose  the  part  of  engine  cover  as  the  recognition  area  which  can  represent  the  vehicles  dominant  color  and  recall  the  position  of  license  plate  known  previously.  so,  we  can  locate  the  area  of  color  recognition  by  the  position  of  license  plate.  some  location  results  of  the  color  recognition  areas  are  shown  in  figure  .  assume  that  the  width  and  height  of  the  license  plate,  respectively,  are  plate  and  plate  and  set  the  width  and  height
__label__situationalsurveillance of  the  color  recognition  area  to  be  2  plate  and  2  plate  .  the  areas  of  color  recognition  and  license  plate  are  vertical  symmetry,  and  the  distance  between  the  bottom  of  the  color  recognition  area  and  the  top  of  the  license  plate  is  3  plate  .  detailed  description  is  shown  in  figure  .  figure  12:  after  locating  the  roi  area  of  color  recognition,  we  transform  the  roi  area  from  rgb  color  space  to  hsv  and  lab  color  space.  previously,  an  experiment  was  conducted  which  made  a  count  on  the  average  range  of  the  seven  colors  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,
__label__situationalsurveillance and  channels  from  our  dataset  of  vehicles.  as  shown  in  table  each  parameter  has  been  normalized  from  0  to  255,  we  can  know  that,  in  hsv  color  space,  white,  silver,  and  black  are  more  different  in  and  but  more  similar  in  .  yellow,  green,  red,  and  blue  are  more  different  in  but  more  similar  in  and  .  so,  we  divide  the  seven  colors  into  two  classes  of  mixed  colors.  color  class  1  includes  white,  silver,  and  black  and  color  class  2  includes  yellow,  green,  red,  and  blue.  in  this  paper,  color  recognition  contains  two  stages.  we  train  a  linear  svm
__label__situationalsurveillance classifier  using  the  features  of  the  normalized  histogram  of  for  stage  1  and  train  seven  linear  svm  classifiers  using  the  features  of  the  normalized  histogram  of  for  stage  2.  assume  the  circumstance  that  classifier  1  responds  to  the  color  of  white  in  stage  1;  we  feed  the  features  to  classifier21  to  get  the  final  result  of  color  recognition  in  stage  2.  the  flow  of  all  the  circumstances  of  color  recognition  is  shown  in  figure  .  table  7:  figure  13:  to  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  our  method,  we  test  the  hsv  hist,  lab  hist,  and  our  method  with  our  dataset  of
__label__situationalsurveillance vehicles,  and  corresponding  results  are  listed  in  table  .  table  8:  vehicle  type  recognition  is  an  important  part  in  vehicle  recognition  system.  various  methods  have  been  proposed  to  recognize  vehicle  types.  before  recognizing  the  types  of  vehicles,  localizing  their  positions  in  videos  is  a  crucial  step.  several  classic  detection  methods  ,  can  provide  accurate  bounding  box  for  each  vehicle.  thus,  the  recognition  of  types  is  performed  in  the  detected  bounding  boxes  of  vehicles  in  this  paper.  we  divide  the  vehicles  into  two  types,  that  is,  small  car  and  large  car,  and  both  of  our  training  and  testing  images  are  collected
__label__situationalsurveillance by  a  vehicle  detector.  in  the  general  framework  of  vehicle  type  recognition,  the  features  of  vehicles  body  play  an  important  role.  image  features  are  generally  classified  into  two  categories,  that  is,  local  features  and  global  features.  since  global  features  matching  shows  less  accuracy  due  to  its  inefficiency  in  handling  rotation  and  scaling,  it  is  not  suitable  for  the  recognition  of  vehicle  types.  local  features  are  extracted  based  on  the  interest  points  in  the  image.  scale  invariant  feature  transform  sift  was  developed  by  lowe  for  image  feature  generation  in  object  recognition  application.  afterwards,  sift  was  improved  by  many  scholars;  one  of
__label__situationalsurveillance the  most  effective  improvements  was  speededup  robust  features  surf  proposed  by  bay  in  2008.  these  local  features  are  all  invariant  to  image  rotation,  scaling,  and  illumination  changes.  consequently,  in  this  paper,  we  combine  the  local  features  of  sift  and  surf  and  train  a  linear  svm  to  recognize  the  vehicle  types.  sift  uses  the  approach  of  detecting  maxima  and  minima  in  the  differenceofgaussian  pyramid  to  localize  key  points.  surf  uses  hessian  matrix  for  localizing  key  points.  when  detecting  the  key  points  by  sift  and  surf  on  an  image  of  vehicles  body,  there  would  be  two  types  of  key  points:  sift  key
__label__situationalsurveillance points  and  surf  key  points.  and  as  the  spatial  information  of  object  can  be  described  by  bagofword  bow  based  methods  ,  we  adopt  the  framework  of  bow  in  our  work.  the  realization  of  the  model  of  bowbased  local  features  contains  three  steps:  in  this  paper,  we  set  128  words  for  each  dictionary,  so  each  image  can  be  described  by  256d  vectors  including  128  dimensions  from  sift  words  and  128  dimensions  from  surf  words.  to  demonstrate  the  advantage  of  our  method,  we  compare  our  method  with  other  five  common  methods  with  our  dataset  of  vehicles.  the  features  of  sift,  surf,  and
__label__situationalsurveillance our  bowbased  combination  of  sift  and  surf  are  fed  to  the  linear  svm,  respectively,  and  corresponding  results  are  listed  in  table  .  table  9:  figure  14:  figure  15:  figure  16:  the  system  in  our  work  is  constructed  upon  the  intelligent  visual  internet  of  things  iviot.  each  node  contains  a  highresolution  camera  and  an  embedded  processor,  and  a  wireless  link  between  these  nodes  and  the  central  server  is  established.  the  central  server  can  receive  and  analyze  the  visual  tags  transmitted  by  all  the  nodes.  the  estimated  route  of  the  target  vehicle  can  be  chronologically  linked  with  the  properties  of  its  visual
__label__situationalsurveillance tag  e.g.,  passing  spot  and  passing  moment  which  can  be  associated  and  mined  from  the  central  database.  for  evaluations,  we  test  the  whole  system  in  changzhou  for  exactly  two  weeks.  the  nodes  designed  in  our  system  can  be  installed  not  only  on  the  urban  roads  for  providing  basic  information  but  also  on  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles  for  providing  mobility  support  and  improving  sensing  coverage.  to  test  the  robustness  of  the  whole  system,  different  weather  conditions  e.g.,  sunny,  cloudy,  foggy,  and  rainy,  different  periods  e.g.,  morning,  noon,  and  evening,  and  different  traffic  flows  e.g.,  light  traffic  and  heavy  traffic  are  all
__label__situationalsurveillance taken  into  account.  during  the  two  weeks  experiment,  there  are  totally  seven  sunny  days,  four  cloudy  days,  two  foggy  days,  and  one  rainy  day.  the  accuracies  tested  in  different  conditions  are  given  in  tables  and  .  the  accuracy  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  number  of  successful  realtime  tracking  vehicles  and  the  number  of  total  vehicles  involved.  table  10:  table  11:  table  gives  the  accuracies  tested  in  different  weather  conditions  and  different  periods.  it  can  be  observed  that  the  accuracy  in  adverse  weather  conditions  is  only  slightly  lower  than  that  in  good  weather  conditions,  which  is  due  to  the
__label__situationalsurveillance preprocessing  of  traffic  video  streaming  e.g.,  image  haze  removal  and  luminance  adjustment.  table  gives  the  accuracies  tested  in  different  weather  conditions  and  different  traffic  flows.  due  to  the  heavy  traffic  in  rush  hour,  vehicles  mutual  occlusions  easily  occur.  some  nodes  cannot  obtain  a  good  recognition  result  or  directly  abandon  the  result  according  to  the  returned  reliability  by  the  algorithm.  to  deal  with  this  problem,  we  adopt  large  numbers  of  true  samples  in  heavy  traffic  condition  to  train  the  classifier  so  that  it  can  improve  the  recognition  robustness.  among  all  the  traffic  videos  used  in  the  experiment,  totally  5825  vehicles  appeared
__label__situationalsurveillance in  the  surveillance  videos  under  human  inspection  and  4998  of  them  can  be  realtime  tracking  by  our  system,  so  the  system  achieves  an  average  realtime  tracking  accuracy  of  85.80  under  different  conditions.  to  verify  the  effectiveness  of  the  mobility  support,  we  also  conduct  the  experiment  without  using  the  information  collected  by  the  mobile  nodes  installed  on  the  sensing  vehicles.  consequently,  the  average  accuracy  is  only  82.21,  which  clearly  indicates  that  the  mobile  nodes  could  contribute  at  least  3  percent  accuracy  to  the  whole  system.  compared  with  the  similar  system  presented  in  ,  the  proposed  system  has  the  following  four  advantages:
__label__situationalsurveillance since  the  nodes  in  our  system  can  be  installed  on  the  urban  roads  and  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles,  a  lot  of  problems  may  appear.  here  we  mainly  discuss  the  most  important  problems  and  corresponding  solutions  as  follows:  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  road  vehicle  monitoring  system  based  on  iviot.  the  nodes  designed  in  our  system  can  be  installed  not  only  on  the  urban  roads  for  providing  basic  information  but  also  on  the  mobile  sensing  vehicles  for  providing  mobility  support  and  improving  sensing  coverage,  and  all  the  nodes  construct  a  large  scale  iviot.  the  system  can  extract  the  vehicle  visual
__label__situationalsurveillance tags  and  achieve  realtime  vehicle  detection  and  tracking.  vehicle  visual  tag  is  the  unique  identification  of  the  vehicle,  so  it  is  of  great  significance  in  hitting  the  fakeplate  vehicles  and  other  criminal  behaviors.  a  fundamental  algorithm  of  extracting  vehicle  visual  tags  is  also  proposed  in  this  paper.  we  can  calculate  the  estimated  route  of  the  target  vehicle  through  the  properties  of  its  visual  tag,  such  as  passing  spot  and  passing  moment.  the  system  is  of  great  importance  to  the  traffic  control  department  and  can  greatly  increase  the  public  security  of  our  society.  in  the  future,  we  will  propose  more  effective
__label__situationalsurveillance algorithms  of  extracting  vehicle  visual  tags  based  on  the  existing  algorithms  and  consider  more  ill  conditions.  besides,  more  mobility  supports  for  the  nodes  of  our  system  will  be  investigated  and  studied.  the  authors  declare  that  there  is  no  conflict  of  interests  regarding  the  publication  of  this  paper.  this  work  was  supported  by  the  nation  nature  science  foundation  of  china  no.  41306089,  the  science  and  technology  program  of  jiangsu  province  no.  be2013372  and  no.  by2014041,  and  the  science  and  technology  support  program  of  changzhou  no.  ce20135041.  ieee  transactions  on  intelligent  transportation  systems  ieee  transactions  on  vehicular  technology  proceedings  of  the  international

__label__situationalsurveillance the  idea  that  ,  or  iot,  heralds  a  new  era  for  people  and  technology  is  far  beyond  theory.  the  transformations  are  already  emerging  all  around  us,  but  those  who  look  only  to  the  corporate  world  may  miss  some  of  the  most  inspiring  examples.  smart  cities  hold  some  of  the  planets  most  aweworthy  demonstrations  of  the  iots  potential.  what  should  wouldbe  insiders  stay  focused  on?  fear  not  of  missing  out,  because  davra  has  with  the  most  impact.  as  far  as  worldshaking  innovations  are  concerned,  modern  urban  spaces  are  hotbeds  of  new  ideas.  the  same  holds  true  in  connected  tech,  yet  a
__label__situationalsurveillance handful  of  applications  stand  out  as  continual  trendsetters.  keeping  the  streets  bright  is  more  than  just  a  good  means  of  attracting  wellheeled  professionals  and  taxpaying  small  businesses  to  a  growing  city.  smart  lighting  contributes  to  improved  quality  of  life  in  ways  that  are  easy  to  see  and  appreciate.  daylight  harvesting  connected  lighting  helps  daylightharvesting  systems  do  better  at  their  job  of  reducing  the  need  for  electrical  power.  by  automating  processes  like  setting  brightness  levels  and  tracking  daily  use,  these  implementations  improve  a  cities  ability  to  stay  green  economically.  load  management  although  lighting  is  an  inevitable  municipal  outlay,  its  not  the

__label__situationalsurveillance is  already  one  of  the  most  iot  mature  segments  that  already  has  millions  of  connected  cars  using  telematics  applications  such  as  vehicle  diagnostics,  location  tracking  and  userbased  insurance.  these  applications  mostly  involve  the  transmission  of  small  volumes  of  non  realtime  data  collected  from  the  vehicles  and  today  they  are  mostly  deployed  over  traditional  cellular  2g/3g/4g  technologies,  that  in  general  provide  a  satisfactory  performance  to  handle  their  current  communication  needs.  however,  the  launch  of  5g  offers  the  possibility  to  collect  more  granular  data  in  realtime  about  the  health  and  performance  of  the  vehicle  and  the  drivers  behavior  and  enable  the  delivery
__label__situationalsurveillance of  more  sophisticated  services  e.g.,  automotive  oems  and  car  dealerships  and  new  pricing  plans  e.g.,  insurance  companies.  while  lte  will  likely  remain  the  leading  connectivity  technology  for  these  applications  in  the  near  future,  especially  with  the  planned  switch  off  of  2g  and  3g  networks  in  many  areas  of  the  world,  in  the  next  few  years  iot  analytics  expects  many  vehicle  telematics  implementations  to  support  both  4g  and  5g  connectivity,  to  futureproof  their  solution  and  take  advantage  of  5gs  enhanced  capabilities  where  available  while  operators  continue  their  progress  with  network  rollouts.  invehicle  infotainment  is  another  relatively  mature  at  application  that  is
__label__situationalsurveillance expected  to  benefit  a  lot  from  5g  connectivity.  this  use  case  involves  the  delivery  of  information  and  entertainment  services  to  drivers  and  passengers,  such  as  updates  on  the  current  traffic  situation  or  weather  forecasts,  but  also  more  dataintensive  video  and  music  streaming.  compared  to  its  major  alternatives  lte,  5g  connectivity  offers  the  ability  to  enhance  these  applications  and  enable  new  ones,  such  as  incar  retail  and  marketing  or  even  ar/vrbased  navigation  systems  and  entertainment  services.  while  for  the  next  couple  of  years  vehicle  infotainment  on  5g  is  expected  to  be  mostly  via  tethered  connections  e.g.,  using  a  5g  smartphone  for
__label__situationalsurveillance the  car  connectivity,  the  emergence  of  dual  mode  4g/5g  solutions  for  connected  cars  over  the  next  few  years,  as  highlighted  in  the  previous  paragraph,  will  pave  the  way  for  more  sophisticated  invehicle  infotainment  applications.  in  the  energy  utilities  sector,  5gs  enhanced  capabilities  make  the  technology  particularly  suited  to  the  realtime  management  and  automation  of  the  smart  electricity  grid.  these  solutions  are  aimed  at  optimizing  operations  and  maintenance  by  quickly  detecting  and  responding  to  faults  along  the  grid,  but  also  meeting  the  increasingly  stringent  demand  on  their  grid,  driven  by  trends  such  as  the  integration  of  distributed  energy  resources  der  like
__label__situationalsurveillance renewables  into  the  power  grid,  tighter  regulations  and  evolving  cybersecurity  threats.  in  particular,  the  integration  of  these  der  microgrids  to  the  electricity  network  is  quite  challenging  due  to  the  high  variability  of  their  energy  production,  and  requires  realtime  control  and  automation  of  the  feeder  line  systems  i.e.,  what  manages  the  feeding  of  the  generated  energy  into  the  grid  to  avoid  overload  and  ensure  system  reliability,  but  also  extensive  message  signaling  between  all  the  microgrids  elements.  all  of  these  translates  into  strict  requirements  in  terms  of  communication  latency  and  network  reliability,  that  today  can  be  fully  satisfied  only  via  wired  communication
__label__situationalsurveillance technologies.  as  a  matter  of  fact,  most  utilities  today  already  have  a  power  grid  monitoring  system  in  place,  typically  based  on  wired  communication  networks  over  power  lines  plc,  optical  fiber  or  copper,  while  wireless  communications  are  limited  to  the  less  missioncritical  applications.  however,  as  utility  operators  upgrade  their  grids  to  increasingly  automate  operations  with  new  sensors  and  control  system  and  integrate  renewable  energy  sources  and  electric  vehicle  charging  stations,  5g  is  expected  to  be  largely  adopted  due  to  its  higher  deployment  flexibility  and  lower  cost  compared  to  wired  alternatives,  while  offering  a  similar  level  of  performance.  in  the  industrial  sector,
__label__situationalsurveillance there  is  a  general  consensus  that  5g  is  most  relevant  for  connecting  industrial  robots  with  various  degrees  of  mobility,  from  static  collaborative  robots  to  fully  mobile  robots  such  as  autonomous  guided  vehicles  agvs.  these  robots  have  many  sensors  for  situational  awareness  while  technological  advances  are  making  them  increasingly  intelligent  and  able  to  autonomously  perform  various  tasks,  such  as  moving  goods  or  carrying  out  repairs.  as  a  result,  they  need  to  be  able  to  process  an  increasing  amount  of  data.  however,  accommodating  enough  processing  capabilities  into  these  robots  can  be  very  challenging  and  expensive,  especially  for  smaller  robots.  5g  can  help
__label__situationalsurveillance solve  these  issues  and  thanks  to  its  low  latency  and  high  reliability,  5g  will  make  it  easier  to  offload  part  if  not  all  of  this  processing  need  to  edge  or  cloudbased  servers  and  thus  minimize  the  hardware  complexity  and  cost  of  the  robots.  video  surveillance  and  analytics  is  another  application  that  is  expected  to  thrive  with  5g  connectivity.  due  to  the  increasing  threats  to  public  safety  in  recent  years,  many  governments  and  municipalities  around  the  world  are  investing  in  public  surveillance  and  security  systems,  and  the  trend  is  expected  to  accelerate  in  the  future.  today,  the  majority  of  public  video
__label__situationalsurveillance surveillance  systems  still  rely  on  wired  connectivity,  but  the  adoption  of  wireless  communications  such  as  wifi  or  cellular  is  gaining  popularity  due  to  an  easier  and  faster  setup  and  generally  lower  cost  compared  to  wired  networks.  while  wifi  is  the  preferred  method  in  static  cctv  systems,  cellular  connectivity,  in  particular  lte,  is  more  popular  for  temporary  static  installations  e.g.,  construction  sites,  public  events  such  as  concerts,  festivals,  election  rallies,  etc.  and  in  mobile  video  surveillance  e.g.,  cameras  installed  on  vehicles  such  as  police  cars,  public  transport,  and  surveillance  drones  or  bodyworn  by  law  officers.  while  lte  networks  offer  a  decent
__label__situationalsurveillance level  of  performance  for  remote  access  to  live  and  recorded  hd  video,  the  adoption  of  5g  will  provide  the  performance  boost  required  for  more  sophisticated  video  content  analytics  in  realtime  and  the  deployment  of  massive  numbers  of  cameras.  on  the  midlong  term,  the  largest  impact  that  5g  is  expected  to  have  in  the  at  sector  is  to  enable  the  sharing  of  realtime  information  about  traffic  and  road  conditions  among  cars  and  other  road  users.  these  new  cooperative  mobility  and  driver  assistance  services  are  for  both  for  private  and  public  transportation  represented  by  two  different  bubbles  in  exhibit  1,  respectively  by

__label__situationalsurveillance billion  by  2050more  than  60.  las  vegas  is  no  exception.  over  the  past  10  years,  the  city  has  experienced  a  40  increase  in  its  population  and  expects  50  growth  over  the  next  decade.  these  explosions  in  city  expansion  have  sprouted  new  challenges  and  exacerbate  existing  ones,  including  traffic  congestion,  environmental  problems  and  safety  issues.  growing  cities  need  new  ways  to  solve  ageold  infrastructure  problems.  to  address  its  issues,  las  vegas  turned  to  the  cisco  ,  which  aggregates  data  from  disparate  internet  of  things  iotconnected  sources:  sensors,  mobile  devices  and  video  cameras.  the  goal  is  to  promote  a  better  experience  for
__label__situationalsurveillance people  using  city  services  and  help  agencies  providing  those  services  with  better  data  at  the  ready.  munish  khetrapal  of  cisco  left  and  michael  sherwood,  cio  of  the  city  of  las  vegas  we  want  you  to  be  enriched  by  the  experience  you  have  in  our  city,  said  michael  sherwood,  chief  information  officer  for  the  city  of  las  vegas  at  a  session  on  smart  city  infrastructure  and  iot  technology  at  in  june.  the  cisco  digital  platform  works  with  applications  that  can  automate  street  and  traffic  lights,  optimize  trash  pickup  and  augment  surveillance  and  crime  prevention.  fifty  billion  iotconnected  devices  are  expected  by
__label__situationalsurveillance 2020;  of  those  20  billion  sensors  will  be  connected  in  cities  alone,  said  munish  khetrapal,  managing  director  of  solutions  at  cisco,  in  the  session.  analyzing  data  quickly  enables  the  city  to  identify  potentially  dangerous  situations  and  take  action.  that  means  you  dont  have  trashcans  that  are  overflowing  or  have  you  walk  into  the  street  and  get  hit  by  a  car,  sherwood  said.  now  we  can  create  a  better  experience  for  everybody.  las  vegas  is  using  iot  sensors  to  manage  its  traffic  congestion  and  environmental  issues.  for  instance,  if  a  driver  is  waiting  at  a  red  light  at  1:00  a.m.,  the
__label__situationalsurveillance sensors  can  gather  carbon  dioxide  levels  and  ambient  traffic  conditions  and  determine  whether  its  safe  to  turn  the  traffic  light  greenrather  than  let  a  car  sit  at  a  red  light  generating  exhaust.  this  is  how  we  can  use  the  infrastructure  smartly,  sherwood  said.  the  city  chose  cisco  for  its  smart  city  initiative  because  we  already  use  cisco  telephony  and  networks.  it  was  a  logical  choice  to  extend  our  foundation  and  thread  it  out,  sherwood  said.  las  vegas  also  wants  to  leverage  the  platforms  open  data  architecture  to  allow  thirdpartydeveloped  applications  to  draw  on  a  wide  variety  of  datacompliant  with  the
__label__situationalsurveillance citys  datause  policies.  the  cisco  platform  has  enabled  other  cities  to  bolster  safety  and  ensure  broader  access  to  health  care  information  and  services.khetrapal  recounted  that  in  jaipur,  india,  on  a  particular  section  of  city  roadway,  there  were  about  4,000  accidents  annually,  and  the  city  had  no  idea  why.  after  installing  iot  sensors  and  video  cameras,  city  officials  learned  that  more  than  70  of  accidents  were  attributable  to  drivers  going  the  wrong  way  down  the  road.  jaipur  police  used  the  information  to  significantly  reduce  the  number  of  accidents  on  the  road.  access  to  data  completely  changed  the  paradigm,  khetrapal  said.  sensors
__label__situationalsurveillance in  jaipur  also  provide  information  on  environmental  factors  like  pollution  as  well  as  on  available  parking  spots  and  tourist  information  at  kiosks.  smart  city  infrastructure  is  also  enabling  more  efficient  and  healthboosting  city  services.  trash  pickup  today  in  granada,  spain,  is  still  manual:  a  truck  stops  at  every  house  on  a  given  street  and  checks  bins.  but  granada  is  in  the  process  of  connecting  14,000  waste  bins  across  the  city  using  sensors  that  will  bring  data  into  the  cisco  platform.  data  about  which  bins  need  emptying  will  soon  make  garbage  truck  routes  more  efficientquite  an  improvement  considering  the  serpentine  system
__label__situationalsurveillance of  oneway  streets.  ultimately,  greater  automation  of  waste  management  could  save  the  city  millions  and  reduce  the  carbon  emitted  by  garbage  trucks  stopping  at  empty  bins.  amsterdam  in  the  netherlands  is  also  using  smart  city  infrastructure  and  connected  lighting  to  reduce  costs  and  boost  safety.  the  pilot  project,  in  concert  with  philips,  enabled  the  city  to  install  iotconnected  energyefficient  lightemitting  diodes  or  leds,  which  can  save  a  city  up  to  13  billion  a  year,  according  to  a  philips  estimate.  while  this  is  a  start,  cities  need  more  aggressive,  longterm  energy  savings.  for  more  connected  lighting  technologiesadaptive  to  and  interoperable  with
__label__situationalsurveillance other  systemsare  needed.  to  bring  smart  city  infrastructure  to  the  next  level,  the  internet  of  everything  ,  a  joint  effort  is  required  to  realize  the  vision  of  smart  connected  cities,  enabling  meaningful  innovation.  a  photo  of  a  mural  depicting  it  pros  as  superheroes  at  cisco  live  2017  while  many  cities  have  started  down  the  road  of  a  smart  city  initiative,  some  encounter  challenges  that  come  with  data  silos.  according  to  an  informationweek  report,  17,000  state  and  local  law  enforcement  agencies  in  the  u.s.  .  moreover,  according  to  mckinsey  co.,  if  unlocked,  data  silos  could  .  information  becomes  more  valuable  as

__label__situationalsurveillance privacy  advocates  voice  concern  about  the  implications  of  data  sharing.  data  privacy  is  already  an  issue  with  iot  devices,  particularly  after  recent  critical  breaches.  privacy  proponents  worry  that  third  parties  given  access  to  data  may  not  be  careful  stewards.  iot  devices  have  also  been  hacked  in  breaches  likethe  .  ciscos  khetrapal  concurred  that  data  security  is  a  critical  consideration,  particularly  regarding  data  ownership:  city  agencies  may  own  their  own  data  but  must  provide  access  to  others  to  reap  the  benefits.  policies  must  address  data  management  that  includes  significant  granularityagencies  can  share  data  by  user,  location  and  so  onand  complexity,  where
__label__situationalsurveillance data  access  can  be  licensed  on  the  basis  of  time,  compliance,  or  other  factors.  sherwood  said  he  expects  persuading  constituencies  to  share  data  will  be  an  ongoing  challenge.  a  lot  of  it  is  territorial.  but  its  about  me  educating  vendors.  he  has  to  demonstrate  the  roi  of  sharing  data  and  building  reciprocity  among  agencies  and  partners.  so,  for  example,  the  rtc  had  a  mobile  app  that  gets  little  usage  compared  with  the  .  sherwood  persuaded  rtc  to  share  data  with  the  city  of  las  vegas,  and  together  they  are  now  building  an  app  that  allows  riders  to  hold  a  smartphone
__label__situationalsurveillance up  at  a  bus  location  and  learn  when  the  next  bus  will  arrive.  ultimately,  this  will  tie  into  mobile  payments  on  smartphones  as  well.  for  cios  like  sherwood,  change  doesnt  come  easily,  and  implementing  iot  and  smart  city  technologies  can  be  less  challenging  than  orchestrating  the  organizational  change  that  comes  with  new  technologies  like  iot  and  smart  city  initiatives.  youre  changing  the  way  you  do  business  when  you  start  implementing  iot,  sherwood  said.  while  i  might  be  the  chief  information  officer,  im  a  really  business  processchange  person.  now  im  going  to  a  department  that  used  to  send  a  truck  up

__label__situationalsurveillance utilities,  transportation,  and  public  services.  cities  around  the  world  are  becoming  smarter.  they  are  implementing  initiatives  to  promote  greener  and  safer  urban  environments,  with  cleaner  air  and  water,  better  mobility  and  efficient  public  services.  these  initiatives  are  supported  by  smart  technologies,  such  as  the  internet  of  things  iot  and  information  and  communication  technology  ict  that  provide  the  technical  framework  to  implement  smart  city  projects.  iot  is  an  essential  technology  without  which  smart  city  initiatives  cannot  exist.  the  things  of  the  iotdevices,  sensors,  applicationscollect  the  data  that  enables  the  technology  solutions  to  be  effective.  for  example,  smart  water  meters  reporting  water
__label__situationalsurveillance quality  and  usage,  alerting  the  water  company  of  leaks,  or  potential  contamination.  that  said,  smart  city  initiatives  need  big  data  analytics  to  function.  the  iot  generates  huge  datasets  that  must  be  analyzed  and  processed  to  implement  smart  city  services.  big  data  platforms,  part  of  the  city  ict  infrastructure,  have  to  sort,  analyze  and  process  the  data  gathered  from  the  iot.  city  governance  integrates  ict  solutions  to  interconnect  public  services,  at  the  same  time  engaging  communities  in  local  governance,  thus  promoting  cooperation.  one  example  of  this  is  the  greater  london  authority  initiative,  where  city  hall  is  using  an  open,  common  platform
__label__situationalsurveillance to  share  data  with  local  communities.  examples  of  application  of  iot  in  smart  cities  include:  sensors  are  at  the  core  of  every  device  in  the  iot  system.  from  connected  cars  to  traffic  lights  and  smart  homes,  almost  every  device  today  has  sensors  that  gather  and  send  data  to  the  cloud.  this  interconnectivity  is  what  makes  possible  the  internet  of  things  system.  for  example,  proximity  sensors  make  possible  the  development  of  automated  vehicle  systems.  smart  cities  use  sensors  to  measure  a  myriad  of  values  from  traffic  congestion  to  pollution  levels,  water  quality,  and  energy  usage.  smart  city  technologies  require  connectivity  to

__label__situationalsurveillance power  usage  efficiently.  the  implementation  of  smart  grids  allows  city  officers  to  analyze  the  power  consumption  in  realtime.  using  data  analytics,  they  can  predict  periods  of  heavy  usage  and  plan  the  energy  distribution  accordingly.  solar  energy  plants  can  install  smart  sensors  to  check  the  panels  for  maintenance.  a  smart  transport  infrastructure  uses  big  data  and  iot  technologies  to  provide  residents  with  access  to  faster  and  safer  travel  across  the  city.  at  the  same  time,  it  gives  city  authorities  data  about  traffic  flow  allowing  them  to  manage  the  transit  efficiently.  usually,  a  smart  city  transportation  system  consists  of  an  intelligent  transportation
__label__situationalsurveillance network  itn.  the  network  usually  includes:  smart  cities  share  one  characteristic,  all  use  sensor  data  to  improve  city  management.  big  data  can  help  cities  to  monitor  and  manage  urban  issues  such  as  waste  disposal,  transportation,  and  saving  resources.  to  do  that,  the  city  needs  to  install  sensors  in  the  infrastructure,  retrofitting  or  replacing  outdated  infrastructure  when  necessary.  to  transform  a  city  infrastructure  in  smart,  the  city  manager  should  develop  three  layers  of  smartness  as  follows:  according  to  this  mckinsey  global  institute  ,  for  a  city  to  be  smart,  it  should  use  technology  and  data  with  the  purpose  of  delivering  a
__label__situationalsurveillance better  quality  of  life.  what  consists  of  quality  of  life?  while  this  is  a  subjective  matter,  most  city  residents  agree  that  a  good  quality  of  life  should  include  improvement  in  the  following  areas:  applications  using  realtime  crime  mapping,  for  example,  use  statistical  analysis  to  detect  crime  patterns  and  identify  problematic  zones,  predicting  the  incidence  of  crime.  this  allows  police  forces  to  reinforce  security  in  these  areas.  one  example  was  the  trial  of  ,  a  predictive  technology  solution  in  new  york  city  which  significantly  lowered  crime.  for  most  city  residents,  improving  the  daily  commuting  time  is  basic  for  a  good  quality
__label__situationalsurveillance of  life.  cities  that  have  smartmobility  applications  in  place  can  reduce  commuting  time  by  as  much  as  20  percent  on  average.  multimodal  mobility  solutions  allow  passengers  to  choose  between  all  available  transportation  options.  this  results  in  lower  car  usage  since  residents  can  opt  for  the  transportation  mode  that  better  suits  them  at  the  moment.  smart  cities  tend  to  attract  technology  companies  and  talent.  this,  in  turn,  attracts  venture  capital  to  the  cities.  cities  like  london  and  new  york  have  received  an  influx  of  investment  capital  thanks  to  their  smart  initiatives.  environmental  concerns  are  at  the  core  of  every  smart  city
__label__situationalsurveillance strategy.  smart  cities  aim  to  reduce  pollution  and  emissions,  through  smart  urban  planning  and  transportation  management.  when  people  walk  and  use  multimodal  mobility,  the  result  is  fewer  cars  on  the  streets,  reducing  emissions.  smart  cities  are  also  characterized  by  the  smart  management  of  their  resources.  smart  city  technologies  and  applications  help  cities  to  change  into  a  greener,  safer  and  effectively  planned  urban  environment.  it  is  no  surprise  then,  that  the  smart  city  model  is  proving  successful  with  over  50  smart  cities  around  the  world  using  smart  technologies  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  its  residents.  with  more  planned  smart

__label__situationalsurveillance new  and  advanced  services  based  on  5g  technology.  the  real  challenge  for  service  providers  is  how  to  identify  which  new  areas  to  prioritize,  as  the  global  digitalization  opportunity  grows.  the  service  provider  industry  opportunity  is  confirmed  to  be  significant  but  is  expected  later  and  to  be  somewhat  differently  distributed  across  industries.  healthcare  now  represents  the  largest  addressable  market,  followed  by  manufacturing,  energy  and  utilities,  and  automotive.  all  of  the  10  industries  considered  here  represent  significant  value  pools,  but  all  also  present  different  barriers  to  entry.  deciding  which  segment  to  target,  what  role  to  take  and  which  barriers  to  overcome  presents
__label__situationalsurveillance key  challenges  for  service  providers  preparing  to  address  enterprise  customers  across  industries.  this  study  aims  to  support  them  on  this  journey.  the  10  industries  examined  in  this  study  are:  manufacturing,  energy  and  utilities,  public  safety,  healthcare,  public  transport,  media  and  entertainment,  automotive,  financial  services,  retail,  and  agriculture.  investments  driven  by  the  value  5g  is  providing  across  these  industries  is  expected  to  be  around  usd  1.5  trillion  in  2030.  but  not  all  of  this  is  expected  to  be  addressable  by  service  providers,  as  the  ability  to  take  a  role  in  the  value  chain  will  differ  by  industry  and  be  subject  to
