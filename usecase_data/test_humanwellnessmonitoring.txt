__label__humanwellnessmonitoring the  lack  of  patient  adherence  to  their  prescribed  medical  regimen  in  the  united  states  is  an  overlooked  but  prevalent  problem,  and  iot  solutions  could  play  an  important  role  in  changing  this  reality.  a  growing  number  of  people  are  taking  pills  every  day  with  written  annually  in  the  united  states.  to  experience  the  full  benefits  of  a  medication,  its  necessary  to  take  the  specified  dose  at  the  recommended  time  and  frequency.  this  is  especially  pertinent  for  individuals  with  chronic  conditions  like  diabetes  and  high  blood  pressure.  research  done  by  the  centers  for  disease  control  and  prevention  in  2017  predicts  that  around
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring 50  percent  of  chronic  patients  are  not  medically  adherent.  this  lack  of  medication  adherence  can  lead  to  devastating  health  outcomes  and  costly  hospital  visits.  in  the  united  states,  its  estimated  that  medical  nonadherence  is  responsible  for  around  10  percent  of  all  hospitalizations,  causes  125,000  deaths  and  costs  the  healthcare  system  between  100  and  289  billion  each  year.  while  these  statistics  are  jarring,  recent  awareness  raised  around  this  issue  is  a  step  in  the  right  direction.  on  the  surface,  the  problem  of  medical  nonadherence  seems  straightforward,  yet  the  underlying  causes  are  various  and  nuanced,  particularly  for  patients  with  a  chronic  illness
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring that  have  complex  medication  regimens.  researchers  have  looked  into  the  causes  of  medical  nonadherence  and  have  arrived  at  a  number  of  conclusions.  in  many  cases,  nonadherence  is  unintentional  and  is  due  to  forgetfulness  or  a  misunderstanding  of  the  prescribed  dosage  and  schedule.  intentional  nonadherence  is  where  things  become  more  complicated.  a  persons  conscious  decision  to  skip  a  dose  can  stem  from  an  inability  to  pay,  experienced  side  effects,  beliefs  about  their  disease,  expectations  for  improvement  or  a  general  lack  of  a  support  system  that  holds  them  accountable.  studies  show  that  an  effective  way  to  counteract  both  these  intentional  and  unintentional
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring barriers  is  to  increase  user  engagement.  this  can  be  done  by  empowering  individuals  to  better  understand  the  benefits  of  their  treatment  regimen  and  by  establishing  a  connected  medical  support  network.  companies  have  turned  to  to  make  medication  routines  as  easy  and  convenient  as  possible.  is  a  simple  and  seamless  smart  pill  bottle  that  acts  as  a  safety  net  for  patients.  it  looks  and  is  used  like  a  normal  pill  bottle  and  requires  zero  setup.  each  time  an  individual  interacts  with  the  pill  bottle,  sensors  send  two  pieces  of  data  to  the  cloud:  a  timestamp  of  when  the  cap  was  opened

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring history,  and  answer  a  bunch  of  questions  before  we  can  get  down  to  the  business  of  healthcare  advice  or  treatment.  i,  for  one,  would  be  ok  with  wearing  smart  health  sensors  to  monitor  my  medication  intake.  i  also  would  be  ok  with  ai  reaching  out  to  me  if  it  detects  a  problem  with,  say,  my  blood  pressure  or  sugar  levels.  or  even  to  natter  at  me  when  ive  yet  again  neglected  to  take  my  meds.  providing  those  detailed  historical  health  records  to  a  medical  professional  of  my  choice  should  be  simple  and  easy,  as  should  moving  between  healthcare  providers.  they

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring their  own  or  in  combination  with  technologies  in  big  data,  ai,  and  .  here  are  some  interesting  examples  of  such  iot  devices.  many  medical  iot  visionaries  aspire  to  improve  cardiac  activity  tracking  for  research  and  clinical  purposes.  mc10  came  up  with  biostamp  npoint,  a  flexible  bodyworn  sensor  that  uses  a  3axis  accelerometer  and  a  gyroscope  to  track  movement  and  gather  ecg  and  emg  data.  the  sensor  can  be  placed  on  various  body  parts,  including  chest,  thigh,  forearm,  sacrum,  and  more.  with  no  wires,  cords  or  additional  electrodes,  this  device  doesnt  restrain  the  subjects  movements,  which  allows  gathering  objective  data.  moreover,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring the  subject  can  travel  from  lab  to  home  freely,  generating  data  during  rest  and  activity  periods  throughout  their  daily  lives.  the  irhythm  company,  in  turn,  dedicated  their  device  to  preventing  atrial  fibrillation  via  timely  arrhythmia  monitoring  and  diagnosis.  irhythms  zio  xt  is  a  longterm  continuous  cardiac  monitoring  patch.  it  is  designed  to  gather  a  patients  data  for  3  to  14  consecutive  days  while  using  machine  learning  to  understand  a  patients  overall  cardiac  health.  the  zio  xt  patch,  which  has  no  leads  or  electrodes,  gathers  representative  data  and  records  abnormal  heartbeats  while  allowing  patients  to  live  their  regular  lives.  additionally,  postmonitoring
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring data  is  generated  into  reports  that  can  be  integrated  with  the  patients  electronic  health  records,  which  is  a  major  incentive  for  providers  to  adopt  the  device.  the  key  to  a  stable  health  status  in  diabetic  patients  is  continuous  blood  glucose  monitoring.  whether  a  patient  has  type  1  or  type  2  diabetes,  monitoring  their  glucose  levels  is  a  part  of  their  daily  lives.  the  most  common  method  of  doing  this  has  been  finger  or  stomach  pricking,  but  advancements  in  iot  healthcare  are  changing  this.  eversense  cgm  system  offers  making  a  huge  leap  toward  a  better  quality  of  life  in  patients  with
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring diabetes.  instead  of  weekly  stomach  pricking  common  to  continuous  glucose  monitoring  cgm  systems,  eversense  is  implanted  in  the  upper  arm.  the  implant,  which  is  good  for  90  days,  is  complemented  with  a  datareceiving  smart  patch.  it  calculates  current  glucose  values  and  defines  whether  the  blood  glucose  levels  are  expected  to  exceed  preset  higher  and  lower  benchmarks.  the  patch  will  alert  patients  via  vibration  prior  to  hyper  or  hypoglycemia  occurring.  all  collected  data  is  automatically  sent  to  the  paired  mobile  app  every  5  minutes,  generating  highly  detailed  blood  glucose  trends.  the  dexcom  g6  is  a  wearable  and  interactive  cgm  system  that

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring further  apart  until  they  feel  they  have  successfully  overlapped  the  blocks.  the  device  compiles  the  results  and  provides  the  user  with  an  eyeglass  number.  the  eyeglass  number  is  not  a  prescription,  but  it  can  be  used  to  purchase  glasses  at  online  retailers.  eyeque  does  not  provide  prescriptions  because  it  is  not  meant  to  replace  annual  visits  to  the  eye  doctor.  instead,  it  is  meant  to  help  manage  and  keep  track  of  eye  health  and  provide  interim  results  between  visits.  additionally,  eyeque  does  not  test  for  everything  an  ophthalmologist  does,  such  as  degenerative  conditions,  colorblindness,  eye  strain,  and  more.  however,  eyeque
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring can  be  a  handy  device  for  people  who  do  not  have  easy  access  to  an  eye  doctor  or  for  those  whose  prescription  changes  frequently.  in  most  cases,  patients  would  rather  be  anywhere  else  instead  of  sitting  in  the  clinic  and  waiting  for  their  next  appointment.  taking  tests  is  even  more  frustrating,  especially  when  youre  not  sure  if  you  really  need  them.  but  what  if  you  could  take  tests  in  the  comfort  of  your  own  home,  prior  to  scheduling  an  appointment?  cue  puts  the  control  in  patients  hands  by  allowing  them  to  monitor  inflammation,  influenza,  vitamin  d  levels,  testosterone  levels,  and

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring human  bodyfriendly  elements.  the  pill  then  disintegrates  in  the  stomach,  leaving  the  sensor  intact.  it  gets  activated  by  gastric  fluids  and  starts  emitting  the  signal  to  the  patch  on  the  patients  body.  the  patch  recognizes  the  signal  and  validates  that  the  pill  was  taken,  visualizing  it  on  the  app.  the  other  role  of  the  patch  is  to  measure  the  patients  rest,  activity,  steps,  and  heart  rate  to  identify  patterns  and  correlations  and  create  a  picture  of  the  patients  health.  this  data  gets  shared  with  providers  via  a  dedicated  portal,  and  the  sensor  then  leaves  the  patients  body  in  a  natural
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring way.  while  there  are  hundreds  of  cycletracking  mobile  applications  that  claim  to  predict  ovulation  and  fertility  windows,  some  women  need  a  more  advanced  approach  to  family  planning.  this  is  where  earlysenses  percept  can  come  in  handy.  percept  is  a  sensor  that  is  put  under  a  mattress,  where  it  identifies  three  types  of  motions  while  the  user  sleeps:  general  body  motions,  breathing,  and  heartbeats.  the  original  algorithm  then  processes  this  data,  differentiating  signals,  and  defining  unique  ovulationrelated  patterns.  these  patterns  allow  percept  to  pinpoint  the  next  period  and  ovulation  dates  as  well  as  a  6day  fertility  window.  due  to  machine  learning,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring the  algorithm  gets  smarter  over  time  and  improves  prediction  accuracy  from  cycle  to  cycle.  despite  an  everwidening  adoption  of  iot  in  healthcare,  there  are  multiple  challenges  along  the  way.  while  there  is  an  array  of  possibilities  that  will  open  up  in  a  decade  or  two,  we  shouldnt  expect  a  quick  clinical  adoption  yet.  many  questions  will  inevitably  arise:  while  these  questions  shouldnt  hinder  innovations,  vendors  need  to  think  through  their  strategies  if  they  want  to  get  widespread  clinical  application.  with  providers  support,  the  industry  will  move  faster  to  embed  wearables,  patches,  implants,  and  ingestible  sensors.  hopefully,  it  can  get  to

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring paper,  we  propose  an  aiempowered  smart  pillbox  system  that  provides  contextaware  reminders.  context  information  is  acquired  by  multisensor  system  placed  in  a  smart  home  environment.  a  novel  argumentation  based  approach  is  adopted  for  solving  the  activity  recognition  problem  et  al.  and  reminder  planning  problem  et  al.  .  the  activity  recognition  module  is  able  to  produce  classification  results  comparable  to  pure  machine  learning  approaches  while  significantly  reducing  the  training  time.  knowing  the  users  current  activities,  e.g.  sleeping,  watching  tv  or  not  at  home,  the  reminder  planner  module  can  adaptively  plan  the  reminding  time  e.g.  delay  to  a  later  time  or  the
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring reminding  device  e.g.  display  reminder  on  tv.  moreover,  this  argumentationbased  approach  can  generate  argumentative  explanations  to  the  classification  results  and  reminding  decisions,  which  makes  the  reasoning  process  more  transparent  and  interpretable.  there  are  a  number  of  electronic  pill  dispensers  available  in  the  market.  for  example,  gms  medelert  automatic  pill  dispenser,  epill  automatic  pill  dispenser  and  philips  medication  dispensing  service.  these  commercial  electronic  pill  dispensers  mainly  focus  on  pill  organization  and  prevention  of  incorrect  dosage  with  locking  functions  and  rely  on  buildin  alarms  for  medication  time  notification.  other  designs  focus  on  tracking  longterm  medication  adherence  data  and  reporting  adherence  in  real
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring time  through  iot  and  ict  techniques.  for  example,  an  instrumented  pillbox  called  medtracker  et  al.  can  track  medication  consumption  data  continuously  by  attaching  sensors  to  the  lids  of  a  sevenday  plaid  pillbox  and  transmitting  sensor  triggering  information  using  bluetooth.  et  al.  pointed  out  that  the  transmitting  range  of  bluetooth  is  rather  limited  and  proposed  to  use  the  internet  to  send  medication  adherence  information  to  any  location  in  the  world.  proposed  to  use  pop  up  notifications  on  smart  phones  for  alarming  at  the  right  medication  time.  the  abovementioned  pillbox  systems  all  adopt  timebased  reminders  without  considering  the  contextual  information  of  the

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring parts:  activity  recognition,  reminder  planner  and  medication  intake  tracking.  the  sensor  data  collected  from  the  smart  home  environment  is  input  into  the  activity  recognition  module  to  generate  user  specific  context  information.  this  context  information,  together  with  the  medication  schedules  input  prior  by  the  user  or  caregivers,  are  input  to  the  reminder  planner  module  to  generate  appropriate  reminders.  medication  intake  tracking  is  used  to  track  medicine  consumption  and  used  for  adapting  the  reminders.  multiple  sensors,  including  two  grideye  infrared  array  sensors,  two  force  sensors,  one  noise  sensor  and  one  electric  current  detector,  are  continuously  collecting  data  from  the  smart  home  environment.

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring within  the  individual  arguments  so  that  high  level  reasoning  can  be  performed  using  wellestablished  argumentation  semantics.  the  advantage  of  the  caabased  activity  detection  approach  is  twofold.  first,  caa  is  able  to  incorporate  domain  expert  knowledge  into  problem  solving,  which  significantly  reduces  the  training  time  as  required  by  machinelearning  based  model  construction.  second,  explanations  for  the  classification  results  can  be  generated  based  on  the  argumentative  structure  of  caa.  based  on  the  medication  schedule  input  prior  and  the  identified  activities  that  the  user  is  currently  engaging  in,  the  reminder  planner  module  will  intelligently  decide  when,  where  and  how  to  issue  the  reminders.
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring the  goal  of  the  reminder  planner  is  to  issue  reminders  accurately  and  provide  pleasant  user  experiences.  before  each  reminder  is  issued,  the  reminder  planner  needs  to  make  the  following  three  decisions  based  on  context:  whether  to  delay  the  reminder:  delay  versus  nodelay;  where  to  display  the  reminder  if  it  is  not  delayed:  on  television  or  tablet  or  mobile  phone;  and  whether  to  increase  the  reminding  volume:  normal  or  increase.  we  adopt  an  argumentationbased  approach  et  al.  for  making  these  decisions.  a  graphical  representation,  named  decision  graph  with  context  dgc,  is  used  model  decision  problems  with  context.  the  problem  of  making
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring contextaware  decisions  in  dgcs  is  converted  into  argumentation  computation  in  wellstudied  argumentation  frameworks.  in  addition,  two  forms  of  explanation  can  be  generated  to  provide  general  and  contextspecific  reasons  for  decisions  made.  we  follow  this  approach  because  of  the  following  advantages  it  has  over  other  available  decisionmaking  approaches:  first,  dgc  is  able  to  capture  the  dynamic  relationships  among  decision  alternatives  and  goals,  making  it  more  expressive  and  flexible.  second,  the  explanations  help  to  make  decisionmaking  process  less  opaque  and  more  understandable  to  human  users.  we  illustrate  the  responses  of  the  reminder  planner  module  in  different  context  as  follows:  if  user  is
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring sleeping  and  medication  is  not  urgent,  delay  the  reminding  time  till  the  user  get  up.  if  user  is  eating  and  the  medication  should  be  taken  half  an  hour  later  after  food,  remind  medication  half  an  hour  after  food  consumption.  if  user  if  cooking  and  pillbox  reminding  device  is  in  the  living  room,  increase  the  reminding  volume.  if  user  is  watching  tv,  display  reminder  on  tv.  if  user  is  not  at  home,  display  reminder  on  mobile  devices.  an  illustration  of  the  implemented  reminder  display  is  given  in  and  .  the  medication  intake  tracking  is  done  through  a  tagandscan  fashion  implemented  by
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring radio  frequency  identification  rfid  tags  and  scanner.  rfid  tags  encoded  with  the  medication  information  e.g.  name,  description,  frequency  of  taking  are  attached  to  medicine  containers.  the  advantage  of  using  rfid  tags  for  identifying  medication  is  that  it  can  be  easily  attached  to  the  containers  of  all  kinds  of  medications,  including  pills,  liquids  and  powder.  to  log  medication  intake,  the  user  simply  needs  to  scan  the  rfid  tag  on  the  medicine  container,  which  is  similar  to  supermarket  checkout.  with  rfid  tags,  medication  intake  tracking  can  get  the  following  information:  whether  medication  is  taken;  the  medication  taken  is  right  or  wrong;  and
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring what  time  the  medication  is  taken,  etc.  an  illustration  of  the  rfid  scanning  is  given  in  .  similar  ideas  have  been  used  in  some  exiting  design  concepts.  for  example,  et  al.  adopted  rfid  in  smart  pillbox  system  for  medication  adherence.  the  difference  is  that  rfid  tags  are  not  attached  to  pillboxes  but  to  the  wristband  of  users.  hence,  rfid  is  for  detecting  users  when  nearby  rather  than  identifying  correct  pill  dosage.  et  al.  proposed  to  use  matrix  barcode  and  a  camera  for  checking  the  right  medication  before  intake,  which  is  similar  to  our  design  concept.  in  this  section,  we  describe
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring two  use  cases  based  on  our  proposed  contextaware  smart  pillbox  system.  this  case  is  illustrated  in  .  according  to  the  medication  schedule,  ticlopidine  hydrochloride  should  be  taken  at  13:00  in  the  noon.  after  processing  the  raw  sensory  data,  the  activity  recognition  module  has  constructed  the  following  arguments:  sofa  empty;  tv  off;  bed  occupied;  and  no  person  by  dining  table.  argument  1  and  2  rule  out  the  possibility  that  the  user  is  watching  tv  and  reading.  argument  4  rules  out  the  possibility  that  the  user  is  eating  or  having  a  friend  visit.  after  argumentative  computation,  the  output  of  the  activity  recognition
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring module  is  sleeping  and  some  explanations  generated  for  analysis  above  are:  it  is  not  watchtv  as  the  sofa  is  empty,  tv  is  off  and  bed  is  occupied  and  it  is  not  visit  as  the  bed  is  occupied  and  no  person  by  table  knowing  that  the  user  is  sleeping  and  ticlopidine  hydrochloride  can  be  taken  within  a  30  min  window,  the  reminder  planner  decides  to  delay  the  reminder  to  13:30  to  achieve  the  goal  of  offering  pleasant  user  experience.  the  delay  is  reflected  in  our  webbased  reminding  platform.  describes  this  case.  according  to  the  medication  schedule,  ticlopidine  hydrochloride  should  be  taken
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring at  18:00  in  the  evening.  the  activity  recognition  module  constructs  the  following  arguments  after  processing  the  sensory  data:  sofa  empty,  tv  off,  bed  empty  and  one  person  by  dining  table.  the  output  of  the  activity  recognition  module  is  eating  and  explanations  for  this  result  include:  it  is  not  sleep  as  bed  is  empty  and  one  person  by  table  and  it  is  not  read  as  sofa  is  empty  and  one  person  by  table  considering  that  the  user  is  eating  and  ticlopidine  hydrochloride  needs  to  be  consumed  after  food,  the  reminder  planner  delays  the  reminder  to  18:30,  as  is  reflected  in  our
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring webbased  reminding  platform.  the  explanation  for  making  such  decision  is:  reminding  without  delay  is  neither  pleasant  nor  accurate  in  current  context.  in  the  context  when  the  user  is  eating  and  the  medication  is  instructed  to  be  taken  after  food,  reminding  on  time  does  not  follow  the  instructions.  by  considering  users  context  information,  the  proposed  smart  pillbox  system  is  expected  to  produce  more  meaningful  reminders  that  occur  at  opportune  moments  and  on  appropriate  devices,  which  may  improve  medication  adherence  in  comparison  to  pure  timebased  reminders.  for  future  work,  we  are  planning  to  study  the  effectiveness  of  contextaware  reminders  for  medication  adherence.
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring with  the  current  setting,  we  are  able  to  track  longitudinal  medical  adherence  data,  e.g.  whether  medicines  are  taken,  whether  medicines  are  taken  on  time,  etc.  this  feature  allows  us  to  unobtrusively  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  contextaware  smart  pillbox  system  over  an  extended  period  of  time.  conceptual  framework  of  the  smart  pillbox  system  implementation  of  the  smart  pillbox  illustration  of  cases  this  research  is  supported  by  the  national  research  foundation,  prime  ministers  office,  singapore,  under  its  idm  futures  funding  initiative.  this  research  is  also  partially  supported  by  the  ntupku  joint  research  institute,  a  collaboration  between  nanyang  technological  university  and

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring recent  sums  up  that  effective  patient  engagement  has  major  impact  on  the  quality  of  care,  according  to  60  of  clinicians  and  health  system  leaders.  moreover,  around  40  of  respondents  believe  the  effort  in  this  field  may  cause  substantial  decrease  in  healthcare  cost.  however,  traditional  personnelheavy  approach  to  promoting  better  patient  engagement  regular  doctor  checkout,  hospital  readmission,  inperson  medication  adherence  monitoring,  etc.  proves  to  be  outdated  and  costly  itself.  therefore,  the  industry  increased  reliance  on  the  technology  in  this  area  and  expects  the  efforts  in  the  field  to  bring  up  .  today,  some  timeproven  already  rely  on  big  technology  including  ai,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring iot  and  virtual  assistants.  patient  portals,  patient  data  processing  systems  and  mobile  solutions  make  the  largest  part  among  the  promising  tools  in  this  regard.  though,  each  of  these  standardbearers  has  its  own  problem  that  hampers  patient  engagement  efforts.  patient  portals  are  endorsed  as  a  top  patient  engagement  tool  by  68  of  professional  clinicians  and  industry  leaders.  apart  from  and  promote  better  adoption  of  patient  portals  among  customers,  industry  leaders  strive  to  smoothly  incorporate  this  tool  into  existing  care  workflows  and  create  new  patientcentric  infrastructure  where  patient  portals  are  accessible  and  ubiquitous.  recent  ,  however,  brings  up  the  pressing  issue  of
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring outdated  security  and  privacy  requirements  that  dominate  in  healthcare  today.  apparently,  conservative  hipaa  regulations  with  more  than  20  yearold  history  limit  the  capabilities  of  modern  patient  portals.  in  turn,  patient  portals  backed  by  hipaaprotected  patient  data  privacy  terms  fail  to  meet  the  requirements  set  for  an  efficient  patient  engagement  solution  fast  access  to  patient  data,  instant  sharing  and  transfer  of  medical  information,  direct  personalized  communication.  as  a  result,  inflexible  privacy  regulations  hamper  the  potential  of  patient  portals  and  cut  off  their  benefits  as  a  patient  engagement  tool.  healthcare  leaders  already  realize  the  issue  and  understand  the  pressure  of  delay  and
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring consequence  of  inaction  in  terms  of  hipaa  modernization.  we  can  expect  reforms  and  introduction  of  more  elastic  legislation  in  this  field.  until  then,  the  industry  is  open  to  alternative  engaging  solutions  that  encourage  patients  to  monitor  and  update  their  health  data.  for  example,  platforms  like  ehr  for  patients  available  on  all  apple  devices  including  apple  watch.  or  inhouse  widely  used  within  kaiser  permanente  health  care  infrastructure.  healthcare  collects  massive  amount  of  raw  patient  data:  health  records,  hospital  admission  and  medication  intake  information,  medical  procedures  reports,  as  well  as  updating  health  conditions  data  collected  by  personal  wearables  and  mobile  devices.  meanwhile,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring it  is  patient  data  that  empowers  nextgen  patient  engagement  tools.  according  to  the  catalyst  research  mentioned  before,  patientgenerated  data  forms  56  of  potential  basis  for  patient  engagement  tools.  clinicians  and  healthcare  executives  believe  it  to  be  the  second  most  important  standardbearer  of  patient  engagement  efforts.  however,  the  industry  uses  only  a  small  part  of  this  data.  the  rest  stays  in  silos  and  never  turns  into  actionable  insights.  despite  the  evident  value,  great  part  of  patientgenerated  data  remains  locked  either  in  legacy  healthcare  operations  such  as  paperbased  health  records  or  strict  and  highly  regulated  data  policies  hint:  20yearold  hipaa.  some  of
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring this  data  is  greatly  overlooked,  hence,  rarely  collected.  for  example,  .  as  a  result,  the  lack  or  misuse  of  patient  data  hampers  the  improvement  of  modern  patient  engagement  technology  personalization  of  healthcare  tools,  treatment  monitoring  apps,  predictive  analytics  for  patient  management.  highend  technologies  such  as  iot  and  ai  rely  on  large  volume  of  constantly  updating  patient  data.  this  hunger  encourages  companies  to  harvest  more  data  and  extract  as  much  value  as  possible.  today,  emerging  sensor  and  trackingbased  iot  solutions  for  healthcare  such  as  connected  hospitals  or  social  care  infrastructures  focus  on  leveraging  patient  data  to  provide  smooth,  more  personalized  patient
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring journeys.  for  example,  zworkss  connected  hospital  allows  to  automate  patient  admission  and  discharge  thanks  to  smart  tracking  and  greatly  improves  patient  experience.  while  aienabled  virtual  therapist  woebot  collects  patient  data  via  chat,  gradually  customizes  dialogues  and  provides  highly  personalized  advice  based  on  patients  behavioural  specifics.  the  industry  doesnt  experience  the  shortage  of  digital  products  for  patient  engagement,  such  as  apps  for  appointment  scheduling,  medication  intake  monitoring,  symptom  tracking.  however,  the  majority  of  existing  mobile  and  web  systems  lack  personalization  and  fail  to  address  the  needs  and  requirements  of  different  categories  of  patients.  hardly  do  many  mobile  apps  with  simple  functionality,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring say  doctor  appointment  scheduling,  adjust  to  users  technical  skills  or  abilities.  instead,  designers  and  engineers  create  individual  mobile  tools  focused  on  a  certain  target  audience,  be  it  the  elderly,  children  or  people  with  special  needs.  this  approach  works,  but  seems  inefficient  in  the  era  or  progressing  technologies  and  connected  everything.  in  reality,  the  industry  needs  more  forwardlooking  solutions  able  to  equalily  address  the  needs  of  various  user  categories  and  provide  personalized  patient  experience  in  the  omnichannel  environment.  patient  engagement  tools  able  to  leverage  personalization  and  context  exist.  often,  they  are  based  on  such  .  for  example,  that  operates  on  various
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring mobile  devices  and  alexa  and  applies  complex  algorithms  to  adjust  its  interface  to  particular  users  needs  and  context.  though,  industryproven  tools  in  the  field  are  rare.  not  surprisingly,  the  biggest  challenge  in  the  design  and  development  of  such  tools  is  strongly  related  to  the  problems  already  familiar  to  the  reader  privacy  policy  restrictions  and  lack  of  actionable  patient  data.  for  example,  to  build  a  truly  efficient  chatbot  able  to  adjust  conversations  to  patients  age,  technical  skills,  health  conditions  and  maneuver  the  dialogue  using  previously  acquired  patient  information  means  to  integrate  strong  nlp  capabilities  into  the  system.  today,  improve  with  tremendous
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring pace.  to  improve,  they  need  user  data  patient  data  in  case  of  healthcare.  to  get  this  data,  they  need  authorised  access.  here  comes  the  vicious  circle.  therefore,  its  still  the  matter  of  time  when  digital  tools  for  patient  engagement,  for  example,  mobile  apps,  chatbots  on  messenger  or  alexa  skills,  will  be  able  to  operate  with  deep  understanding  of  the  context  and  fully  address  customer  needs.  as  you  see,  three  most  endorsed  and  relied  upon  patient  engagement  technologies  share  the  same  set  of  problems  restricted  access  to  patient  data,  outdated  regulations  and  policies  and  shortage  of  forwardlooking  design  concepts  and  capabilities.

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring pharma  is  reaching  out  from  its  traditional  medicinecentric  approach.  glaxo  recently  announced  that  it  is  investing  in  electroceuticals,  bioelectrical  drugs  that  work  by  microstimulation  of  nerves  .  jj  has  teamed  up  with  google  to  develop  robotic  surgery.  in  addition,  they  are  collaborating  with  philips  on  wearable  devices  such  as  blood  pressure  monitors  .  novartis  is  working  with  google  again  on  sensor  technologies,  such  as  the  smart  lens,  and  a  wearable  device  to  measure  blood  glucose  levels  .  sensors  can  provide  a  lot  of  information  to  support  pharma  development,  but  it  is  particularly  important  to  recruit  the  right  patients  for  the

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring when  it  comes  to  the  healthcare  industry,  providing  treatment  and  diagnosis  to  remote  locations  where  doctors  are  not  easily  available  or  accessible  is  difficult.  however,  with  the  help  of  iotenabled  embedded  medical  devices,  healthcare  specialists  can  easily  identify  diseases  and  provide  treatments  in  a  timely  manner  from  distant  locations.  in  this  blog,  we  shall  discuss  how  embedded  iot  medical  devices  work.  with  the  proliferation  of  the  internet  of  things  iot  devices,  there  has  been  a  huge  transformation  in  terms  of  smart  cities,  connected  manufacturing,  wireless  communication,  and  connected  healthcare.  if  we  talk  about  the  healthcare  industry,  there  has  been  a
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring significant  revolution  in  terms  of  delivering  healthcare  services  in  remote  locations,  where  doctors  are  not  easily  available.  many  healthcare  facilities  have  started  adopting  embedded  solutions  for  medical  devices  enabled  with  iot  to  address  the  lack  of  availability  of  doctors  in  remote  areas.  these  iotenabled  medical  devices  help  identify  diseases  in  patients  and  conduct  different  tests  to  provide  an  accurate  and  reliable  treatment  to  patients  in  remote  locations.  embedded  medical  devices  reduce  the  time  to  diagnose  and  treat  patients  effectively  since  these  systems  run  on  a  highspeed  processor  with  rich  operating  system  interface.  these  devices  store  data  of  each  patient  on
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring the  cloud  and  use  them  for  different  analysis  and  diagnosis  purpose  on  a  repetitive  basis,  decreasing  the  overall  treatment  turnaround.  iot  medical  devices  work  by  connecting  to  different  hardware  for  the  diseases  examination  purpose.  the  device  system  has  a  touchscreen  interface  for  users  to  input  data  for  analysis  and  processing.  as  a  user  inputs  data  related  to  the  diseases,  the  system  looks  for  symptoms  preloaded  into  the  file  and  tries  to  match  with  the  provided  input.  if  the  match  is  found  with  the  preloaded  symptoms,  the  system  responses  with  the  disease  name  and  generates  a  prescription  for  general  medicine.  in
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring case  of  a  partial  or  no  match,  the  system  notifies  to  undergo  a  different  test  based  on  the  input  given  by  the  user  and  preloaded  file  matching  to  identify  the  exact  disease  and  provide  prescription  accordingly.  prescriptions  and  other  important  details  are  stored  on  the  cloudbased  database  management  solution  which  can  be  used  for  future  analysis.  this  patient  information  stored  in  the  cloud  can  be  also  used  for  different  analysis.  for  the  number  of  patients  suffering  malaria  in  the  month  of  march  2018  in  new  york  area,  the  above  analysis  can  be  used  to  find  the  root  cause  of  that
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring particular  disease  in  that  area  in  the  march  months  time  frame.  the  next  time,  the  same  data  can  be  used  to  take  precautions  to  reduce  the  number  of  people  being  affected  by  the  same  disease.  if  proper  disease  information  cannot  be  found  by  the  given  input  and  other  tests  performed,  the  system  contacts  the  doctor  with  the  given  information.  the  doctor  will  then  diagnose  the  patient  and  update  the  symptom  and  disease  files  for  the  future  use.  it  is  important  to  note  here  that  every  embedded  medical  device  should  be  certified  by  fda  standards  before  it  goes  into  production.  let

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring february  24  26,  2020  rancho  bernardo  inn,  san  diego,  ca  the  internet  of  things  iot  refers  to  any  internet  enabled  device  which  is  not  used  to  directly  access  the  web  such  as  smartphones,  personal  computers  etc.  everything  from  refrigerators  and  coffee  makers  to  cars  and  can  be  iot  enabled,  but  smart  devices  are  more  ingrained  than  in  simple  gadgets.  while  the  focus  for  iot  implementation  has  thus  far  largely  been  on  home  and  leisure  equipment,  its  move  into  marks  a  shift  in  the  way  internetenabled  devices  are  viewed  not  simply  as  extra  functionality  for  gadgets,  but  as  integral  components  in
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring how  human  society  is  run.  smart  devices  can  now  tell  city  workers  which  skips  are  full  and  need  emptying,  or  whether  pressure  has  dropped  in  a  gas  main  indicating  a  leak  and  then  automatically  arrange  for  the  appropriate  service  agent  to  attend  the  issue.  image  source:  data  scientists  estimate  that  by  2020  there  will  be  over  20  billion  iot  devices  installed.  most  of  these  devices  will  clearly  be  applied  to  consumer  products,  but  a  significant  number  over  seven  million  will  be  used  commercially.  and,  while  not  all  will  have  field  service  applications,  many  will  and  nowhere  does  this  have  the
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring potential  to  be  more  disruptive  and  critical  than  in  the  medical  device  industry.  at  present,  medical  device  field  service  must  take  a  breakfix  approach  to  problems.  in  an  iot  free  world,  a  medical  practitioner  needs  to  notice  a  device  isnt  functioning  as  it  should  before  they  contact  the  appropriate  field  service  department  who  will  then  dispatch  an  engineer/technician  to  attend  to  it.  however,  with  medical  devices  fitted  with  iot  sensors,  field  service  agencies  can  receive  constant  and  realtime  status  reports  from  all  equipment  theyre  responsible  for.  alerts  can  then  be  set  for  when  devices  fall  outside  of  acceptable  parameters,  and
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring technicians  can  be  automatically  dispatched  to  address  the  issue  all  before  medical  practitioners  even  become  aware  of  a  problem.  image  source:  not  only  will  this  result  in  happier  clients,  but  it  also  means  that  small  problems  can  be  addressed  before  they  become  larger  issues.  this  will  save  time  and  money,  yes  but  also  lives,  as  iot  sensor  reporting  can  prevent  critical  medical  equipment  from  failing  completely.  software  can  be  updated,  and  issues  diagnosed  and  even  repaired  remotely  thanks  to  iot  potentially  avoiding  the  need  for  dispatching  a  technician  altogether.  with  many  field  service  industry  experts  predicting  a  major  role  for
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring wearable  technology  in  the  future,  combined  with  predictions  for  the  proliferation  of  iotenabled  devices,  the  potential  for  remote  diagnosis  and  repair  is  even  greater.  being  able  to  diagnose  and  potentially  repair  an  issue  from  a  smartwatch  or  phone  would  represent  a  true  paradigm  shift  for  the  field  service  industry.  without  iotenabled  medical  devices,  when  issues  are  reported,  an  engineer  needs  to  be  dispatched  to  diagnose  the  source  of  the  problem  before  any  repairs  could  be  attempted.  however,  as  medical  devices  are  installed  with  iot  technology  that  can  report  their  status  to  digital  networks  in  realtime,  this  aspect  of  the  technician
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring role  should  be  greatly  reduced.  technicians  adopting  a  procedural  approach  to  repairs,  as  opposed  to  diagnosing  ambiguous  malfunctions,  will  significantly  reduce  the  time  required  for  individual  repairs,  and  therefore  the  cost  and  interruption  to  clients.  image  source:  while  this  approach  will  likely  have  implications  on  the  level  of  skill  technicians  are  required  to  have  in  order  to  carry  out  their  jobs,  it  will  also  result  in  new  roles  being  created.  a  requirement  for  technicians  skilled  in  the  diagnosis  and  repair  of  issues  which  may  occur  with  the  sensors  and  other  hardware  which  makes  iot  connectivity  possible  will  emerge  creating  new
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring career  opportunities.  iotenabled  infrastructure  reporting  to  field  service  personnel  also  has  the  knockon  effect  of  increasing  revenue  for  all  sides  of  the  interaction.  not  only  in  seizing  the  opportunities  presented  by  emerging  technologies  such  as  the  maintenance  of  the  equipment  used  in  revolutionary  breakout  treatments  but  also  in  businesses  with  existing  clients.  practitioners  will  be  more  satisfied  with  the  service,  as  the  shift  to  being  able  to  predict  potential  issues  and  act  before  they  become  a  major  problem  will  result  in  less  downtime  meaning  less  interruption  to  their  ability  to  deliver  treatment.  patients  will  also  be  more  satisfied  as  their
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring treatment  will  be  delivered  more  consistently  with  fewer  complications  arising  from  malfunctioning  medical  devices.  satisfied  clients  will  have  a  greater  chance  of  being  retained,  and  be  more  likely  to  recommend  iotenabled  field  service  agencies  to  fellow  healthcare  organizations  leading  to  fresh  business  opportunities.  as  already  discussed,  the  optimization  of  diagnostic  processes  will  reduce  the  time  needed  by  technicians  on  each  job.  this  will  lead  to  more  callouts  being  completed  during  the  working  day  resulting  in  reduced  perjob  costs,  and  a  more  streamlined  and  efficient  business  model.  iot  technology  allows  connected  devices  to  automatically  report  issues  to  field  service  agencies.  however,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring iot  also  empowers  medical  devices  to  be  able  to  communicate  with  one  another.  image  source:  by  breaking  down  the  physical  barriers  between  the  components  of  a  system,  you  allow  individual  objects  to  coordinate  with  and  account  for  one  another  enhancing  their  collective  performance.  field  service  technicians  will  be  able  to  use  this  integration  to  create  a  complete  view  of  connected  devices  and  systems  allowing  for  holistic  analysis  and  the  optimization  of  networks.  with  so  many  medical  devices  needing  to  communicate  with  one  another  to  function,  this  integration  is  especially  critical  in  the  healthcare  industry.  iot  technology  is  ideally  placed  to
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring revolutionize  the  way  the  medical  device  field  service  industry  carries  out  business.  from  diagnosis  and  repair  to  new  revenue  opportunities,  iot  is  well  on  its  way  to  streamlining  and  optimizing  medical  device  field  service  work  on  every  level.  phone:  1  888.482.6012  1  646.200.7530  fax:  1  646  200.7535  processing  your  payment  may  take  a  moment.  please  click  submit  payment  only  once,  and  do  not  refresh  this  page.  doing  so  may  result  in  your  credit  card  being  charged  more  than  once.

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring passwords  based  on  something  they  know,  but  others  will  not,  and  record  only  the  prompt  where  its  accessible.  for  example,  the  prompt  fishing  trip  could  relate  to  the  password  bgh0rnmto92o16.  once  employees  have  created  their  lists  of  prompts  and  associated  passwords,  make  sure  they  lock  lists  containing  passwords  in  a  drawer  and  never,  ever,  discuss  them  either  at  or  outside  of  work.  of  course,  they  can  keep  their  prompt  lists  handy  for  efficiency.  regardless  of  how  thorough  an  it  department  is  at  creating  a  comprehensive  iot  security  strategy,  it  should  never  be  considered  complete.  instead,  the  most  secure  organizations  are

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring healthcare  sector,  said  a  recent  .  in  addition,  the  iot  allows  devices  to  be  interconnected  with  each  other  to  improve  patient  monitoring,  patient  outcomes,  decrease  in  errors  and  other  benefits,  which  is  likely  to  boost  the  market  growth,  report  authors  continued.  due  to  the  introduction  of  iot  in  healthcare,  the  efficiency,  effectiveness  and  quality  of  the  service  in  healthcare  has  improved.  while  the  introduction  of  iot  and  connected  medical  devices  has  improved  patient  care,  organizations  may  run  into  problems  when  onboarding  too  many  devices  for  the  network  to  handle.  not  only  do  providers  need  to  make  sure  their  wireless  network
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring is  robust  enough  to  handle  the  increased  traffic,  but  they  also  need  to  figure  out  how  to  make  connected  devices  available  everywhere  from  clinicians  moving  throughout  the  facility  and  patients  receiving  care  via  telehealth  programs.  many  organizations  dont  fully  understand  the  strain  they  put  their  wifi  under  or  what  kinds  of  challenges  arise  with  connecting  devices.  not  addressing  these  connectivity  issues  can  significantly  waste  time  and  money,  according  to  .  how  wireless  signals  will  be  able  to  penetrate  physical  barriers  is  one  of  the  biggest  signaling  challenges  healthcare  organizations  will  face.  older  facilities  made  of  concrete  or  buildings  that  were
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring not  originally  built  with  wireless  access  in  mind  are  especially  challenging  for  introducing  wireless  devices  into  the  health  it  infrastructure.  physical  signal  obstacles  are  often  not  considered  when  provider  locations  and  building  materials  are  selected.  urban  healthcare  organizations  that  are  looking  to  expand  their  medical  campus  will  often  purchase  older  buildings  or  buildings  that  were  originally  intended  for  a  different  purpose.  wifi  uses  such  a  high  frequency  and  the  higher  the  frequency,  the  smaller  the  electrical  sign  wave,  maurer  explained.  the  smaller  the  electrical  sign  wave,  the  more  resistant  it  is  to  penetrating  the  different  materials  of  construction  that  are
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring found  in  facilities.  this  can  cause  problems  when  clinicians  move  through  a  facility  made  of  different  building  material.  the  device  will  always  search  for  the  strongest  signal.  every  healthcare  facility  is  different,  and  this  can  make  it  difficult  to  plan  an  effective  wireless  network.  health  systems  that  spend  millions  of  dollars  upgrading  and  modernizing  their  network  will  still  dynamically  change  because  theyre  adding  new  things  to  the  building  and  theyre  bringing  in  new  equipment,  said  .  theres  no  onetime  view  of  the  network.  a  wireless  vendor  can  help  assess  the  healthcare  facility,  plan  where  access  points  need  to  be  placed,

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring innovations  for  healthcare  providers.  healthcare  iot  applications  utilizing  the  tracking  and  sensing  of  devices  have  increasingly  become  more  affordable  and  more  precise.  these  developments  bring  with  them  the  promise  of  a  next  level  of  quality  in  terms  of  patient  experience  and  operational  efficiency  provided  throughconnected  healthcare  facilities.  improved  patient  monitoring  will  allow  for  a  safer  and  less  intrusive  checkin  regimen  during  overnight  stays.  the  tracking  of  critical  assets  such  as  storing  medicines  in  individual  rooms  while  maintaining  a  security  audit  and  cold  chain  brings  both  increased  operational  efficiencies  and  quicker  care  to  patients.  implementing  databacked  approaches  to  employee  scheduling  presents
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring benefits  to  staff  and  improves  their  ability  to  provide  care  for  individual  patients.  of  course,  the  world  of  iot  also  comes  with  risks  that  rightfully  leave  those  in  it  departments  wary.  with  hipaa  requirements  in  place,  iot  in  healthcare  introducesseveralunique  security  and  confidentiality  components  that  must  be  takenseriouslyandplanned  for  well  in  advance.  to  introduce  an  iot  application  at  the  scale  of  a  hospital,  a  healthcare  campus,  or  entire  healthcare  system,  requires  flawless  execution  in  terms  of  secure  connectivity  and  edge  computing.  that  edge  component  is  critical.  it  provides  the  computing  power  to  effectively  process  data  near  the  source  and  allows
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring an  iot  task  to  execute  without  delay.  this  need  for  reliability  and  security  can  be  challenging  and  expensive  especiallyif  healthcare  providers  attempt  to  design,  develop  and  deploy  their  own  solutions.  healthcare  facilities  are  not  alone  in  facing  the  challenge  of  occupying  buildings  that  are  illequipped  for  inhouse  development  and  deployment  of  an  edgecapable  system.  it  is  thesefactors  the  complexity,  risk,  connectivity,  and  cost  that  have  historically  been  barriers  to  the  adoption  of  iot  in  the  healthcare  space.  however,  solutions  arenowavailable  thanks  toa  secureand  scalableedge  architecturemodel:the  utilization  of  edgecapable  wireless  gateways  that  bring  iot  applications  under  a  single  access  point,  provide
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring the  necessary  compute  power  for  iot,  and  connect  devices  to  cloud  providers  seamlessly  and  securely.  furthermore,  the  proliferation  of  bluetooth  low  energy  5  ble  has  made  the  connectivity  of  devices  far  more  cost  effective  both  in  terms  of  the  actual  devices  and  in  the  required  power  draw.  the  result  is  sensors,  asset  tags,  and  gateways  that  are  affordable  enough  and  managed  well  enough  to  be  deployed  at  scale.  here  are  a  few  examples  of  what  this  looks  like  in  practice,as  well  as  instances  where  the  industry  is  seeing  success,  momentum  and  innovation  with  iot  in  healthcare.  blebased  sensors  for  measurements
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring such  as  temperature  or  other  vital  signs  offer  real  advantages  in  patient  monitoring.  the  devices  are  sophisticated  enough  that  they  can  transmit  data  by  the  second,  allowing  for  more  visibility  into  a  patients  status  even  as  inperson  checkins  are  conducted  less  frequently.  wireless  capabilities  are  critical  as  well.  using  ble  means  a  longer  battery  life  and  a  more  effective  wireless  connection.  this  results  in  patients  who  can  be  more  mobile  and  monitored  outside  of  their  hospital  rooms.  in  turn,  this  results  in  a  more  comfortable  experience  for  the  patient,  as  it  eliminates  a  constant,  tethered  connection  to  wired  bedside  devices.
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring with  hipaa  as  an  additional  consideration,  confidentiality  components  must  be  designed  into  the  network.  for  example,  using  techniques  such  as  macaddress  rotation  allows  facilities  to  collect  employee  or  patientlevel  data  without  it  being  tied  to  an  individual.  this  means  that  even  in  the  event  of  a  security  breach,  the  information  cant  be  connected  to  a  single  person.  this  form  of  advanced,  confidential  and  realtime  patient  monitoring  is  one  of  the  most  indemand  iot  applications  in  healthcare  today.  healthcare  providers,  such  as  eldercare  facilities  and  inpatient  hospitals,  are  installing  gateways  in  every  patient  room  and  in  common  areas  to  provide  safer,
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring less  intrusive,  and  more  flexible  monitoring.  keeping  track  of  important  and  expensive  equipment,  such  as  oxygen  tanks  or  wheelchairs,  may  not  be  a  new  concept  in  healthcare,  but  the  reduction  in  the  cost  of  tracking  tags  and  monitoring  solutions  means  loss  prevention  is  being  extended  in  terms  of  what  can  be  inventoried  and  tracked.  utilizing  wireless  iot  gateways  allows  for  coverage  to  be  extended  all  the  way  to  the  perimeter  of  a  campus.  this  provides  for  realtime  location  of  an  asset  and  an  alarm  to  be  triggered  if  an  asset  enters  a  geographically  restricted  area.  key  assets,  such  as  medicines
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring or  medical  devices,  can  also  be  tracked  by  implementing  locks  with  a  credential  system  and  an  audit  trail.  coldchain  management  for  medicines  and  vaccines  can  also  bedeployed  at  scale.  the  costs  for  sensors  have  been  reduced  to  the  point  that  individual  containers  can  now  be  affordably  temperature  tracked  as  they  move  about  a  facility.  when  the  cost  and  effectiveness  of  perishable  treatments  is  at  stake,  this  becomes  a  critical  need  as  it  brings  additional  confidence  in  the  service  a  facility  provides.  there  are  some  key  considerations  for  this  type  of  iot  deployment,  such  as  what  level  of  accuracy  is  required
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring and  what  level  of  cost  and  performance  tradeoffs  must  be  balanced.  for  that  reason,  a  best  practice  is  to  implement  a  flexible  gateway  infrastructure  where  all  types  of  iot  applications  can  be  installed  and  configurations  can  more  easily  be  changed  as  necessary.  scheduling  has  long  been  a  hot  category  in  healthcare  as  providers  seek  optimization  of  staff  hours  with  patient  care.  however,  seeking  out  accurate  information  as  to  how  worker  skillsrelate  to  task  times  has  always  been  a  challenge.  selfreporting  of  how  time  is  used  can  often  be  estimated  in  a  way  that  results  in  halfbaked  assumptions  for  schedulers.  the
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring ability  to  costeffectively  gather  realtime  data  about  staff  location  significantly  alters  this  equation.  by  understanding  where  staff  are  located  during  a  day,  and  what  areas  require  certain  levels  of  attention,  iot  applications  can  offer  new  options  for  optimizing  staff  scheduling.  in  turn,  this  can  help  improve  both  staff  utilization  and  patient  care.  in  each  of  these  use  cases,  security  remains  paramount.  we  previously  looked  at  one  strategy  of  ensuring  confidentiality  for  patients  the  rotation  of  mac  addresses  but  key  considerations  must  go  into  each  level  of  network  design.  utilizing  providers  both  on  the  application  and  hardware  side  that  provide  constant
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring security  patches  and  support  is  a  must.  also  make  sure  they  have  developed  systems  and  safeguards  to  protect  both  from  digital  attacks  as  well  as  physical  ones.  an  individual  removing  a  gateway  from  a  wall,  or  a  sensor  from  a  device,  should  not  be  able  to  access  any  data  being  transferred  or  any  security  keys  being  stored.  to  effectively  implement  these  solutions,  healthcare  facilitiesshould  look  to  an  edge  infrastructurepartner  that  understands  the  desired  iot  applications  and  can  bring  them  together  onto  a  unified  and  secure  gateway.  the  flexibility  of  allowing  multiple  applications  to  run  through  a  single  access  point  is
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring critical  when  installing  and  managing  devices  at  scale.  it  also  ensures  the  system  exists  as  a  costeffective  modelthroughout  the  life  of  the  installation.  edge  solution  providersand  application  developers  must  also  approach  such  installations  as  a  partnership,  as  opposed  to  a  sale.  long  term  support,  potentially  through  a  subscription  model,  providing  constant  and  consistent  security  updates  is  critical.  these  asaservice  subscriptions  ensure  you  have  assistance  in  monitoring  the  system  and  replacing  the  devices  if  the  technology  becomes  obsolete  or  fails.  that  said,  make  sure  you  are  not  being  locked  into  a  closed  technology  or  an  infrastructure  tied  to  exclusive  partnerships.  open
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring platforms  are  important  to  ensuring  the  longterm  success  as  your  needs  shift  or  the  scale  of  your  deployment  changes.  these  partnerships  reduce  the  complexity  and  risk  associated  with  healthcare  iot.  they  empower  facilities  and  providers  to  make  the  promise  of  iot  a  reality.  the  result  is  healthier  patients,  more  effective  staff,  and  more  efficienthealthcare  operations.  justin  rigling  is  the  cofounder  cto  of  .  topic  area:  the  disruption  involving  from  50  to  75  people  started  when  someone  with  a  nonlethal  gunshot  wound  was  brought  to  the  hospital  12/5/2019  upgrades,  such  as  casual,  bistroinspired  settings  with  a  contemporary,  even  cool,  aesthetics  are

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring systems  now  depend  on  connected  devices  and  sensors  to  capture,  translate  and  store  critical  information.  iot  has  become  pervasive.  in  fact,  nearly  of  healthcare  organizations  have  now  introduced  some  sort  of  iot  device  or  connected  system  into  their  facilities.  with  nearly  everyone  carrying  a  mobile  device  and  the  number  of  internetconnected  things  skyrocketing  the  security  threats  surrounding  wireless  devices  have  become  a  top  concern.  in  addition  to  managing  risk,  healthcare  organizations  are  also  trying  to  capture,  and  intelligently  analyze,  the  large  amount  of  data  from  connected  devices.  over  the  next  decade,  hospitals  and  other  healthcare  organizations  will  continue  increasing  their
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring adoption  of  iot  devices,  and  see  more  coming  through  the  doors.  it  will  be  crucial  for  it  leaders  to  identify  technology  solutions  that  enable  scalable  technology  infrastructure,  risk  mitigation  and  management,  and  effective  ways  to  draw  insights  from  collected  data  in  order  to  help  inform  critical  business  decisions.  indoor  positioning  technology  is  one  example  of  a  technology  application  that  has  the  power  to  transform  healthcare  operations  and  help  the  industry  harness  the  potential  of  big  data  and  realtime  analytics.  through  its  capabilities  to  detect,  monitor  and  provide  rich  analytics  for  every  cellular,  wifi,  and  bluetoothenabled  device  and/or  asset,  healthcare  organizations
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring can  enhance  efficiency,  ameliorate  overall  workflow,  and  even  isolate  and  protect  against  potential  security  threats.  patients  and  their  family  members  regularly  bring  personal  devices  such  as  smartphones  and  tablets  in  and  out  of  hospital  buildings.  these  devices  often  go  unmonitored  as  most  hospitals  dont  have  adequate  resources  or  built  in  solutions  to  keep  a  running  inventory.  this  is  problematic  as  threat  actors  targeting  healthcare  systems  may  use  their  iot  devices  as  a  means  to  gain  access  to  a  hospitals  network  with  the  intention  of  stealing  confidential  data.  instilling  proper  security  systems  in  a  healthcare  setting  is  crucial  in  order  to
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring protect  patient  medical  records  and  patient  safety.  if  an  unauthorized  device  including  any  cellular  or  wifi  device  successfully  gains  access  to  a  hospitals  system  or  database,  the  consequences  could  be  severe.  medical  records  have  grown  in  value,  and  are  worth  just  as  much  or  even  more  than  financial  records  on  the  dark  web.  in  addition  to  medical  records,  patients  lives  are  also  at  stake.  a  compromised  network  could  lead  to  a  complete  overtake  of  a  hospitals  computer  systems  that  track  patient  medical  records,  and  monitor  and  manage  mediation,  surgical  procedure  recommendations,  blood  work  requests  and  more,  putting  patient  safety  at
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring great  risk.  indoor  positioning  technology  has  the  ability  to  passively  and  anonymously  monitor  all  on  premise  devices  and  differentiate  between  authorized  and  unauthorized  devices  alerting  hospital  it  staff  in  realtime  if  a  rogue  device  is  detected.  as  an  extra  layer,  healthcare  it  systems  should  install  security  software  that  continuously  monitors  their  network  and  has  automated  response  capabilities  so  that  if  an  attack  does  occur,  it  can  be  quickly  mitigated  to  prevent  further  network  infiltration.  through  proper  implementation  of  indoor  positioning  analytics  technology  and  locationbased  tools,  hospitals  can  integrate  big  data  with  other  iot  ecosystems  to  improve  security  measures  and  increase

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring will  have  experience  managing  large  unstructured  datasets  and  be  confident  in  using  nonconventional  data  management  tools.  the  primary  objective  of  this  professional  is  to  identify  patterns  and  trends  running  through  the  data  that,  when  compiled  in  a  database,  should  aid  with  the  diagnosis  of  patients.  when  selecting  a  data  scientist,  especially  for  a  role  in  healthcare,  knowledge  of  subject  matter  is  preferential.  the  use  of  electronic  health  records  is  becoming  more  prominent  and  is  changing  the  insight  offered  by  modern  medicine,  thus  leading  to  improved  treatments.  but  its  data  scientists  who  are  needed  to  decipher  the  information  in  order  for
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring that  to  occur.  for  the  implementation  of  iot  to  be  undertaken  successfully  in  the  healthcare  industry,  devices  need  to  be  structured  around  specific  network  architecture  to  ensure  that  every  piece  of  technology  is  introduced  and  maintained  to  a  high  standard,  which  should  theoretically  lead  to  zero  breakdowns  in  communication  between  the  network  and  devices.  the  first  aspect  of  the  architecture  to  be  introduced  regarding  iot  is  device  management.  normally  falling  under  the  remit  of  a  member  of  the  security  and  it  team,  it  is  the  role  of  this  individual  to  ensure  security  protocols  are  followed  during  the  introduction  process  of
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring new  devices  and  maintained  during  their  lifespan.  next  on  the  architectural  structure  list  is  infrastructure  management.  often  overlapping  with  device  management  processes,  the  speed  in  which  devices  are  connected  is  key  to  how  effectively  they  are  implemented.  owing  to  their  computational  limits  reducing  their  speed  and  memory,  numerous  iot  devices  are  modified,  with  a  boosted  connection  to  the  cloud  to  increase  their  productivity.  the  primary  aim  when  introducing  iot  devices  into  a  network  is  to  harness  the  power  of  data,  and  this  can  be  positively  achieved  by  incorporating  data  management  as  an  architectural  structure.  using  the  skills  of  a  data

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring actually  then  look  at  real  data  in  terms  of  how  we  implement  process  improvement  type  initiatives.  ganguly  explained  the  top  three  iot  use  cases  in  healthcare  that  hospitals  are  using  now,  orshould  be.  hospitals  are  not  using  iot  to  track  inventory  in  as  widespread  a  manner  as  would  be  desirable,  ganguly  said.  he  added  that  the  healthcare  sector  could  learn  a  few  lessons  from  retail.  hospitalsare  trying  to  in  how  to  deploy  those  tools  and  integrate  them  with  their  erp  solutions  on  the  back  end,  he  said.  for  hospitals,  the  big  advantage  they  can  glean  from  iotinventory  managementwill  be  in
__label__humanwellnessmonitoring areas  like  pharmacy  and  overall  inventory  control  in  warehouses.  i  think  were  going  to  see  that  increase  over  the  next  few  years  dramatically,  but  in  general,  hospitals  are  justscratching  the  surface  with  iot,  ganguly  said.  although  the  concept  of  has  been  out  there  for  5  to  10  years,  ganguly  said  adoption  of  this  technology  hasnt  taken  hold  as  rapidly  as  he  would  like.  i  think  the  price  point  of  the  devices  coming  down  dramatically  and  the  increasing  reliability  of  the  wireless  infrastructure  are  two  of  the  things  that  are  going  to  help  drive  this,  ganguly  said.  so  i  think  its

__label__humanwellnessmonitoring in  the  past.  ganguly  said  that  when  it  comes  to  iot  for  ,  the  focus  is  more  on  the  consumer  end.  people  are  looking  athow  to  integrate  things  like  the  fitbitsand  other  fitness  devices  to  bring  patient  provided  data  into  the  cycle  of  care  delivery,  ganguly  said.  ganguly  added  that  jfk  health  system  is  looking  into  glucometers,  blood  pressure  cuffs  and  other  devices  that  cancollect  data  and  statistics  on  vital  signsof  patients.  the  expectation  is,  ganguly  said,  that  this  will  allow  us  to  collect  that  data  in  a  more  automated  fashion  and  apply  some  decision  support  rules  to  that  to
