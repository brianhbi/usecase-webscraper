__label__interactivedisplays sector  communications  and  by  that  i  mean  hospitals,  government  offices,  local  councils,  prison  services,  jobcentres,  military  training  facilities  and  so  on,  the  opposite  is  true.  the  answer  is  digital  signage.  this  is  the  process  of  using  digital  screens  and  tv  monitors  to  deliver  timely,  relevant  and  interesting  content  to  those  in  high  footfall  waiting  areas  i.e.  hospital  waiting  rooms,  police  stations,  council  offices  and  so  on.  theres  huge  potential  to  take  what  works  for  the  public  in  one  sense  and  make  it  work  in  other  environments.  some  of  the  benefits  of  using  digital  signage  in  these  traditional  public  sector  spaces
__label__interactivedisplays include:  with  that  in  mind,  here  are  five  of  our  top  tips  to  consider  when  thinking  about  using  digital  signs  within  this  space.  when  you  land  at  london  heathrow  airport  now  and  queue  up  at  customs,  there  are  a  ton  of  digital  screens  that  play  the  same  video  on  loop.  this  videoexplains  about  the  electronic  passport  gates  and  how  to  use  them  correctly.  this  means  that  by  the  time  the  passenger  gets  to  the  front  of  the  queue  they  should,  in  theory,  know  exactly  the  right  way  to  place  their  passport,  where  to  look  and  how  to  step  through.  the
__label__interactivedisplays benefit?  passengers  know  how  to  use  the  machines,  can  get  through  more  quickly  and  dont  have  to  feel  stupid  by  getting  it  wrong  at  the  same  time,  the  electronic  gates  work  more  quickly,  saving  staff  time  and  allowing  the  queue  to  flow  more  easily.  this  is  just  one  use  case.  there  are  a  ton  of  others  to  show  how  you  can  use  digital  signs  to  assist,  provide  information  and  generally  help  your  visitors  have  a  better  experience.  in  2012,  when  hurricane  sandy  hit  new  york,  hotels  that  had  digital  signage  used  them  to  keep  guests  up  to  date  with  what
__label__interactivedisplays was  happening,  the  affected  areas  and  emergency  numbers.  this  may  have  been  fed  in  direct  from  the  news  or  other  live  streams  but  it  was  seriously  effective  and  made  sure  that  everyone  was  receiving  the  same  consistent  message.  the  trouble  with  many  communication  strategies  is  that  different  messages  are  fed  from  different  sources.  social  media,  word  of  mouth  and  live  broadcasts  all  feed  in  different  messages  and  the  output  can  be  confusing.  in  emergency  situations,  digital  signage  provides  the  public  sector  with  a  single  hub  through  which  one  consistent  message  can  be  fed.  the  great  thing  about  modern  digital  signage
__label__interactivedisplays systems  is  that  theyre  incredibly  scalable  at  any  level.  most  public  sector  areas  operate  in  networks.  creating  an  individual  setup,  strategy  and  cost  sheet  for  each  could  get  time  consuming.  but  with  a  system  like  screencloud,  you  can  add  as  many  digital  signage  screens  as  you  like  to  your  account  and  manage  them  all  from  one  central  interface.  this  means  you  could  create  one  standard  playlist  of  content  for  all  of  the  police  stations  in  a  specific  state  or  county,  but  then  add  in  individual  touches  for  each  by  simply  dropping  a  slide  in  for  that  specific  screen.  this  would
__label__interactivedisplays allow  you  to  add  regional  phone  numbers  or  updates  and  ensure  that  each  line  of  communication  is  personalized  for  each  area.  genious  public  sector  organizations  need  speed  and  the  ability  to  deliver  internal  information  quickly  and  easily.  unfortunately,  this  is  not  always  the  case.  how  many  times  have  you  sat  in  daylong  email  chains,  or  lengthy  phone  calls  where  half  of  the  information  is  irrelevant  to  you?  digital  signage  displays  are  incredibly  visible.  were  wired  to  look  at  screens  according  to  studies,  digital  media  in  public  venues  than  videos  on  the  internet  or  facebook.  thats  huge  old  fashioned  memos  and
__label__interactivedisplays emails  just  dont  reach  everyone  theyre  supposed  to.  sure  you  can  send  them  out  this  way  first,  but  why  not  remind  staff  about  the  training  meeting  or  fire  drill  time,  by  displaying  it  on  a  digital  sign  for  everyone  to  see?  digital  signage  improves  communication  in  the  public  sector  and  helps  deliver  messages  that  people  want  to  read.  if  you  ask  your  staff  whats  the  most  asked  question  at  reception  how  many  of  them  would  say;  where  are  the  toilets  or  similar?  people  who  enter  council  offices,  hospitals  and  so  on  can  often  find  it  difficult  to  navigate  to  where

__label__interactivedisplays moreover,  because  the  market  uptake  of  digital  signage  has  been  so  rapid,  the  workload  of  site  owners  and  operators  is  rising  due  to  factors  such  as  the  increasing  number  of  screens  to  be  managed  and  the  emergence  of  different  forms  of  digital  signage.  the  integrated  information  service  enables  more  efficient  operation  by  reducing  the  complexity  and  hassle  of  operating  digital  signage.  the  service  is  made  up  of  the  following  four  parts  see  figure  2.  hitachi  supplies  a  cms  that  is  equipped  with  workflow  functions  that  are  used  across  a  variety  of  different  operations  in  the  daytoday  running  of  digital  signage.
__label__interactivedisplays this  is  called  an  intelligent  cms.  it  is  possible,  for  example,  to  produce  display  plans  that  efficiently  match  content  to  the  people  who  will  view  it  by  first  grouping  signage  locations  based  on  the  attributes  of  the  people  found  there,  such  as  sites  where  large  numbers  of  commuters  pass  in  the  morning  and  evening,  or  locations  where  family  groups  tend  to  gather  during  the  lunch  hour.  the  central  distribution  platform  runs  on  the  cloud  and  serves  as  an  interface  for  linking  the  integrated  information  service  to  digital  signage  distribution  systems  with  different  specifications.  the  central  distribution  platform  can  broadcast  content

__label__interactivedisplays to  do  with  the  data  it  is  receiving,  know  how  and  where  to  display  it,  and  know  how  to  recover  if  the  internet  goes  down  for  a  short  period  of  time.  more,  there  will  be  over  2500  of  these  new  signs  installed  throughout  the  city  as  part  of  an  effort  by  the  mta  to  provide  their  riders  with  more  information  and  technology  in  the  stations.  this  article  will  focus  on  the  technical  solutions  that  acquia  has  implemented,  along  with  its  partner  civicactions,  and  how  we  have  approached  this  scenario  using  drupal  and  amazons  internet  of  things  iot  service  from  amazon
__label__interactivedisplays web  services  aws.  if  youre  interested  in  a  higherlevel  overview,  please  check  out  the  metropolitan  transit  authority  on  acquia.com.  at  a  high  level,  the  architecture  for  this  system  is  simple:  when  considering  data,  there  are  several  types:  train  arrivals,  weather,  time,  messages,  and  slideshows.  each  of  these  data  types  comes  from  one  or  more  sources,  and  each  has  different  data  formats,  granularity,  and  update  intervals.  the  first  iteration  of  this  architecture  was  a  functional,  yet  unscalable  pull  based  system.  in  the  initial  approach  each  sign  was  responsible  for  acquiring,  parsing,  and  displaying  its  own  data.  the  signs  were  constantly  polling
__label__interactivedisplays various  apis  for  arrivals  information,  messages,  weather  information,  etc.  while  functional  and  elegant,  this  approach  was  flawed.  having  the  signs  do  all  the  work  meant  lots  of  redundant  processing  and  api  rate  limiting.  also,  there  was  a  high  risk  that  the  signs  could  create  a  denial  of  service  dos  scenario  on  our  own  hardware.  the  proof  of  concept  was  released  into  a  handful  of  subway  stations  in  new  york  and  was  used  successfully  for  months.  while  this  approach  was  unscalable  to  cover  the  entire  city,  it  worked  sufficiently  for  the  few  dozen  signs  that  were  part  of  the  conceptual  phase.
__label__interactivedisplays as  we  moved  into  the  second  iteration  of  the  architecture,  we  had  to  accommodate  thousands  of  signs,  where  the  proof  of  concept  was  only  capable  of  supporting  a  few  dozen.  in  order  to  accommodate  such  a  large  number  of  devices,  we  had  to  abandon  the  pull  architecture  for  a  more  scalable  push  approach.  we  also  introduced  a  central  data  acquisition,  parsing,  and  sending  approach  that  drastically  simplifies  the  front  end  duties  and  exponentially  reduces  the  number  of  requests  against  the  provider  apis.  by  centralizing  the  data  tasks  into  a  single  location,  we  create  opportunities  both  for  streamlining  our  pipeline  and
__label__interactivedisplays bottlenecking  it.  it  is  critical  that  all  components  in  this  data  pipeline  run  as  quickly  and  optimally  as  possible.  in  order  for  raw  data  to  be  effectively  and  efficiently  parsed  and  sent  to  the  appropriate  signs,  our  parsers  must  understand  context.  unfortunately  for  us,  none  of  the  data  feeds  provide  context  this  is  not  uncommon.  data  feeds,  particularly  those  that  update  very  rapidly,  must  be  as  streamlined  as  possible  to  cut  down  on  size  and  processing  time  for  the  system  that  generates  it  in  the  first  place.  this  is  where  a  content  model  comes  in  place.  a  key  in  the
__label__interactivedisplays data  or  several  data  fields  somehow  map  into  the  model,  which  then  provides  context  for  how  the  data  should  be  consumed  and  handled  by  the  system.  for  the  mta,  this  content  model  needed  to  be  representative  of  the  assets  in  the  city  of  new  york.  this  model  should  create  a  digital  representation  of  the  various  routes  n,q,r,w,  etc.,  stations  grand  central,  penn  station,  etc.,  platforms  uptown,  downtown,  mezzanine,  etc.,  tracks,  and  signs  that  will  be  included  in  the  data.  a  key  component  of  the  mta  system  is  the  flexibility  of  our  content  model.  why?  were  using  drupal  to  manage  it.
__label__interactivedisplays each  of  the  above  assets  is  represented  by  a  content  type.  individual  items  in  the  content  model  are  created  as  nodes,  and  then  entity  reference  fields  are  used  to  provide  the  necessary  context  and  relationships  between  the  items.  user  experience  is  a  major  component  of  this  feature  as  drupals  involvement  allows  nontechnical  users  to  log  into  the  administration  site  with  the  appropriate  account  access  and  make  changes  to  the  content  model  on  the  fly.  the  content  model  also  has  the  added  benefit  of  being  available  for  any  content  that  is  created  inside  drupal.  as  messages  are  created  within  drupal,  they
__label__interactivedisplays can  be  targeted  at  various  granularities  e.g.  display  across  an  entire  route  or  only  on  a  single  platform.  we  knew  early  on  that  we  would  pay  a  price  for  including  drupal  in  the  content  model  in  performance.  executing  queries  against  the  drupal  database,  while  well  documented  and  easy  to  do,  is  not  a  particularly  fast  operation.  particularly  as  the  number  of  objects  in  the  database  scales  to  include  thousands  and  thousands  of  pieces  of  content.  particularly  when  data  must  be  parsed  and  sent  every  few  seconds.  to  ensure  we  have  the  necessary  speed,  we  must  operate  against  a  cache  instead
__label__interactivedisplays of  drupal  itself.  the  content  model  is  archived  into  an  inventory  file  that  the  data  pipeline  reads  every  few  seconds  to  provide  the  necessary  context  to  the  data.  any  time  the  content  model  is  changed  on  the  drupal  side,  it  is  recached  and  made  available  to  the  next  iteration  of  data.  this  effectively  gives  us  the  performance  of  a  static  content  model  very  fast  with  a  flexible  and  user  friendly  method  of  updating  it  drupal  with  none  of  the  drawbacks  of  either  solution.  as  mentioned  previously,  there  are  several  types  of  data  that  the  system  must  consume:  train  arrivals,  weather,
__label__interactivedisplays time,  messages,  and  slideshows.  each  type  of  data  has  its  own  unique  data  source,  that  is  updated  on  regular  if  different  intervals  over  an  encrypted  connection.  data  is  provided  in  either  an  xml  or  json  format.  in  order  to  gather  data  from  these  providers  on  regular  intervals,  we  need  regularly  running  jobs  on  a  web  server  that  can  execute  the  necessary  tasks.  in  our  case,  we  are  using  cron  jobs  that  execute  drush  scripts  which  then  kick  off  the  appropriate  data  pipelines  for  each  of  the  data  sources.  we  will  discuss  this  in  more  detail  later  in  the  article.  our
__label__interactivedisplays data  pipelines,  starting  with  a  data  provider,  are  a  perfect  example  of  our  approach  to  implementing  an  object  oriented  code  base  on  this  project.  an  abstract  provider  class  provides  key  methods  that  are  needed  for  any  provider  regardless  of  its  update  interval,  data  format,  etc..  we  can  then  extend  this  base  class  for  each  specific  provider  to  add  additional  clarity  to  the  methods  defined  in  the  abstract  class.  as  a  data  feed  updates  and  the  most  current  data  is  acquired  by  the  provider,  it  is  validated  against  a  model  that  defines  the  expected  structure,  data  format,  and  fields.  this  helps
__label__interactivedisplays ensure  that  invalid  or  altered  data  cannot  be  pulled  into  the  pipeline.  the  model  also  provides  a  structure  for  basic  transformations.  for  example,  our  train  data  arrives  in  a  milliseconds  format  and  is  displayed  in  a  minutes  format.  all  of  the  needed  functionality  for  a  provider,  model  and  other  key  features  for  the  data  pipelines  are  wrapped  in  drupal  modules  mostly  for  the  convenience  of  being  able  to  directly  interact  with  them  via  drush.  these  modules  share  many  common  features  and  functions  as  they  all  extend  the  same  base  classes  and  methods.  this  makes  maintaining  the  various  pipelines,  learning  the
__label__interactivedisplays system,  and  doing  any  refactoring  and  updates  significantly  easier.  the  next  step  in  the  pipeline  is  categorizing  the  data.  most  of  the  data  coming  through  our  system  is  only  relevant  given  context  weather  and  time  being  the  exception  to  this  rule,  as  these  are  currently  constant  throughout  all  signs.  however,  there  is  no  context  in  the  source  data.  this  is  where  the  content  model  comes  into  play  as  we  break  the  single,  large  data  sets  into  smaller  components.  lets  look  at  the  actual  transit  data,  as  an  example.  a  single  data  file  contains  enough  data  for  thousands  of  screens  and
__label__interactivedisplays is  accurate  for  a  few  seconds  until  the  next  data  file  is  generated.  the  only  context  that  arrives  in  the  data  file  is  a  marker  that  identifies  the  station.  the  combination  of  station  id,  direction,  and  tracks  can  be  used  to  extrapolate  exactly  where  the  data  must  go,  but  that  context  does  not  exist  in  the  data  file  itself.  once  the  data  is  acquired  by  the  provider  and  checked  against  the  model,  the  categorizer  takes  over.  using  the  content  model  as  a  map,  it  breaks  apart  the  large  data  set  and  bins  it  by  platform.  the  station  id  in  the
__label__interactivedisplays data  is  used  against  the  content  model  as  a  reference,  and  additional  information  in  the  data  file  related  to  specific  track  and  direction  are  all  used  to  properly  bin  the  data.  the  categorizer  also  reorders  the  data.  in  our  case,  we  sort  it  based  on  the  arrival  time,  but  there  could  be  other  transformations  performed  here  as  well.  since  each  of  the  data  feeds  has  slightly  different  requirements  in  terms  of  organization,  each  drupal  module  /  feed  has  the  potential  to  contain  a  custom  categorizer.  this  is  an  important  as  some  of  the  data  is  relevant  at  a  platform  level
__label__interactivedisplays train  data  and  some  of  the  data  is  relevant  at  a  screen  level  which  is  more  granular.  once  the  transformations  are  completed  by  the  categorizer,  its  time  to  send  the  data.  getting  data  to  the  signs  themselves  represent  a  significant  challenge.  with  a  normal  web  application  running  on  a  personal  device,  it  is  assumed  that  a  user  will  eventually  reload  a  page,  navigate  to  a  new  page,  etc.  with  a  sign,  there  will  never  be  a  user.  this  means  that  once  a  sign  comes  online,  it  has  to  maintain  a  connection  to  its  data  source  for  long  periods  of  time.
__label__interactivedisplays while  there  are  many  types  of  messaging  and  communication  protocols,  each  of  them  has  drawbacks  and  limitations.  we  ultimately  decided  that  a  websocket  is  an  ideal  solution  to  this  problem,  given  its  ability  to  stay  open  for  long  periods  of  time  and  the  relatively  low  overhead  of  the  connection  since  it  doesnt  have  to  make  a  request  to  get  data.  as  the  data  comes  out  of  the  categorizer,  we  use  our  sender  classes  to  transmit  the  data.  in  some  scenarios  we  want  that  data  to  actually  go  to  a  screen,  but  in  others,  for  testing  or  automated  build  purposes,  we
__label__interactivedisplays dont.  as  a  result  we  have  various  sender  classes  that  can  be  called  that  can  customize  the  behavior  of  the  pipeline.  regardless  of  the  datas  destination,  the  sender  class  wraps  the  categorized  data  in  a  message  object.  this  allows  the  various  data  that  comes  from  each  provider  to  still  be  unique  for  its  purpose,  but  ultimately  be  sent  in  a  consistent  format.  if  the  data  is  being  sent  through  the  websocket,  the  sender  packages  a  destination  for  the  data  in  the  object,  based  on  the  platform  or  screen  that  is  receiving  the  data,  and  a  credential  object  that  will  be
__label__interactivedisplays used  for  authenticating  the  data  as  it  is  sent.  our  primary  sender  class  is  designed  to  interact  with  the  aws  iot  service.  as  a  service,  we  dont  have  to  worry  about  scaling  up/down  as  message  traffic  changes  over  the  course  of  the  day.  aws  handles  all  of  the  autoscaling  as  needed.  the  iot  service  also  nicely  fits  our  use  case  as  it  provides  a  mqtt  protocol  for  websocket  traffic,  which  is  a  lightweight  protocol  specifically  designed  for  sending  messages  between  devices.  the  standard  approach  when  using  iot  is  to  define  various  topics  in  the  service.  topics  are  used  both  as
__label__interactivedisplays a  place  to  push  data  from  the  sender  class  and  as  a  place  to  subscribe  to  data  from  the  front  end.  as  soon  as  our  sender  class  pushes  data  into  a  topic,  any  devices  screens  that  are  connected  to  that  topic  receive  the  payload  in  a  matter  of  milliseconds.  this  is  powerful  as  it  allows  us  to  subscribe  multiple  devices  to  the  same  topic  and  push  data  to  more  than  one  sign  at  the  same  time  we  used  the  aws  php  sdk  to  create  our  own  aws  sender  class.  we  also  wrote  a  simple  drupal  module  that,  through  configuration,  manages
__label__interactivedisplays aws  credentials  key  based  and  endpoint.  this  allows  our  sender  to  dynamically  generate  credential  objects  without  relying  on  hard  coded  credentials.  it  also  allows  us  to  avoid  certificate  based  authentication  since  managing  certificates  on  thousands  of  devices  is  a  daunting  task.  by  using  mqtt  communication  vs.  http  requests  we  can  bypass  the  certificate  requirement  entirely,  and  send  credentials  over  an  encrypted  connection  as  part  of  the  sending  process.  we  can  also  update  and  change  these  credentials  as  needed  thanks  to  our  authentication  module  without  having  to  redeploy  the  code.  we  are  actively  working  to  open  source  this  module  so  others
__label__interactivedisplays can  benefit  from  it.  as  we  began  on  phase  2,  our  earliest  goal  was  to  get  basic  communication  up  and  running.  this  initial  architecture  used  the  most  basic  approach  to  iot:  authenticate,  send  data  to  topic,  push  data  to  devices.  all  energy  was  put  into  creating  a  proof  of  concept  in  the  php  and  react  code  that  would  allow  us  to  demonstrate  the  a  basic  data  pipeline:  get  data,  parse  data,  send  data,  see  it  on  a  screen.  this  early  version  of  the  code  didnt  handle  scale,  didnt  have  any  error  handling,  wouldnt  reconnect  if  the  connection  dropped,  etc.  but,
__label__interactivedisplays it  did  transmit  data.  it  was  a  good  first  step.  as  we  got  closer  and  closer  to  production  code,  we  realized  that  we  had  a  problem.  the  basic  topics  in  the  iot  have  no  history.  as  soon  as  data  is  pushed  to  the  topic,  its  gone.  this  isnt  necessarily  a  problem  as  long  as  all  of  the  devices  are  connected  when  the  data  is  pushed.  however,  if  a  device  disconnects  or  there  is  any  interruption  in  communication  once  it  reconnects  it  will  have  to  wait  for  the  next  payload  before  it  has  anything  to  show.  in  our  use  case,  we
__label__interactivedisplays send  train  data  multiple  times  a  minute,  so  this  isnt  a  huge  concern.  however,  other  types  of  data  are  sent  much  less  frequently.  if  there  is  no  history  on  the  topic,  we  now  have  a  dilemma:  do  we  send  data  more  frequently  than  we  need  to  so  we  can  cover  the  just  in  case  scenario  that  a  device  might  have  been  disconnected,  or  do  we  run  things  at  the  proper  intervals  and  have  signs  that  are  missing  data?  ultimately  we  discovered  the  device  shadows.  these  are  special  variants  on  the  typical  topics  that  do  store  history.  if  we  would  have
__label__interactivedisplays known  about  this  part  of  the  api,  we  would  have  started  here.  the  shadows  work  more  or  less  exactly  like  the  standard  topics,  they  just  use  slightly  different  portions  of  the  sdk  to  function,  and  the  naming  conventions  for  the  topics  are  different.  the  biggest  advantage  of  a  device  shadow  is  that  if  a  device  does  get  disconnected,  when  it  reconnects  it  automatically  receives  the  last  payload  that  was  sent  to  the  topic.  we  are  still  using  this  version  of  the  code  in  our  production  environment  today.  however,  we  did  run  into  one  final  roadblock  that  we  had  to  solve.
__label__interactivedisplays once  our  codebase  was  mature  enough  for  production,  we  ran  in  depth  simulations  of  the  entire  data  pipeline.  we  ran  several  times  the  expected  data  load  through  each  of  the  classes  to  see  how  they  would  perform  under  load,  and  we  discovered  a  problem.  we  could  acquire  and  parse  the  data  very  very  rapidly,  under  a  second  on  the  production  hardware.  but  at  times  it  would  take  anywhere  between  fifteen  seconds  and  two  minutes  to  fully  send  all  the  categorized  data  to  aws.  this  didnt  make  any  sense.  acquia  uses  aws  servers  for  our  cloud  environments.  we  could  see  the
__label__interactivedisplays data  being  parsed  very  quickly,  but  when  it  came  time  to  actually  send  it,  it  ground  to  a  halt.  eventually,  after  much  troubleshooting  and  debugging,  we  realized  that  the  sending  queue  was  taking  much  longer  to  execute  than  we  imagined.  each  time  we  pushed  a  payload  out  of  the  pipeline,  it  was  causing  a  log  jam  that  got  worse  and  worse.  we  were,  essentially,  parsing  data  faster  than  we  could  send  it.  the  thing  we  found  that  made  the  most  impact  on  this  was  implementing  the  command  pool.  with  the  command  pool,  we  can  parallelize  the  actual  transmission  of  data
__label__interactivedisplays to  aws.  this  cuts  down  on  the  number  of  authentications  we  have  to  make,  and  it  clears  the  log  jam  before  it  can  form.  once  we  implemented  the  command  pool  and  jacked  up  the  concurrency,  we  instantly  saw  our  communication  lag  fall  back  into  acceptable  levels.  most  iterations  of  the  arrivals  pipeline  which  is  by  far  the  most  data  at  any  time  breaks  down  as  acquire  and  parse  data  in  roughly  one  second  and  sending  data  in  three  to  four  seconds.  the  first  proof  of  concept  of  our  system  relied  heavily  on  a  backbone.js  frontend.  backbone  was  able  to  handle
__label__interactivedisplays all  of  the  procedural  logic  needed  to  acquire  data,  parse  it,  and  display  it.  as  we  moved  into  the  second  phase  and  the  new  architecture,  we  opted  to  move  to  a  more  traditional  headless  or  decoupled  drupal  implementation.  we  rebuilt  the  entire  front  end  from  the  ground  up  using  react  and  nested  it  inside  of  a  drupal  theme.  we  realize  that  usually  a  headless  drupal  has  a  stand  alone  front  end,  so  in  this  case  we  have  coined  the  term  nearly  headless  drupal.  draw  your  own  popculture  parallels  as  you  see  fit.  a  nearly  headless  drupal  in  this  case  was
__label__interactivedisplays critical,  as  the  front  end  needs  much  of  the  same  context  from  our  content  model  as  the  categorizer  and  sender  classes  do.  the  sign  cant  subscribe  to  the  correct  websocket  if  it  doesnt  know  which  websocket  to  subscribe  to.  it  cant  authenticate  against  our  services  if  it  doesnt  have  the  proper  credentials.  by  deploying  the  react  application  from  within  a  drupal  theme,  we  can  still  use  php  on  the  backend  to  send  information  directly  into  the  front  end  via  drupalsettings  and  other  objects.  could  we  have  done  this  in  a  completely  decoupled  fashion?  clearly.  but  in  this  case,  we  were
__label__interactivedisplays able  to  reduce  the  service  calls  between  the  front  end  and  drupal  itself  to  get  this  information.  remember,  with  thousands  of  signs,  we  are  actively  trying  to  move  away  from  anything  that  could  inadvertently  dos  ourselves.  requiring  the  signs  to  query  and  authenticate  into  drupal  to  get  credentials  and  other  key  information  so  that  they  could  then  authenticate  into  the  websocket  immediately  creates  an  additional  level  of  dependency  and  would  significantly  increase  traffic  to  the  web  server  itself.  once  subscribed  to  the  websocket,  the  front  end  no  longer  needs  the  web  server  or  drupal.  all  data  flows  to  the  sign
__label__interactivedisplays directly  from  the  iot.  the  signs  may  periodically  need  to  be  reloaded  to  receive  new  information  from  drupal,  or  if  anything  in  the  front  end  has  been  changed  e.g.  new  styles  or  javascript  logic.  other  than  that,  once  bootstrapped,  the  sign  is  largely  an  independent  vehicle  that  operates  entirely  within  the  react  application  running  in  its  browser.  react  was  an  ideal  choice  in  this  case,  as  so  much  of  what  the  front  end  must  do  is  wait  for  data  and  then  change  display  logic  based  on  the  payload.  is  there  arrivals  data?  great,  show  that  template.  does  one  of  the

__label__interactivedisplays and  controlled  for  both  the  vehicle  and  home  environments,  utilizing  a  homogeneous  speech  interface.  along  with  an  increasing  number  of  digital  appliances  in  the  smart  home  space,  complex  control  or  management,  including  numerous  data  storage  systems,  is  becoming  a  heavy  burden  on  the  smart  home  system  .  home  devices  connected  to  smart  home  server.  cloud  computing  represents  an  ondemand  service  model  for  delivering  resources  ranging  from  storage  and  data  access  via  computation  to  software  provisioning,  so  it  becomes  an  ideal  alternative.  thus,  we  consider  that  the  smart  home  can  merge  into  the  cloud  to  provide  more  services  and  obtain  more
__label__interactivedisplays information  provided  by  the  cloud.  zigbee  and  wifi  wireless  home  automation  technology  are  being  adopted  to  modify  existing  housing.  the  coexistence  of  wireless  technologies  in  iot  wifi,  zigbee,  bluetooth,  and  bluetooth  low  energy  is  considered  for  an  indoor  environment  ,  ,  ,  .  as  the  number  of  devices  increases,  the  possibility  of  interference  in  a  home  environment  also  increases.  interference  in  a  home  environment  is  a  result  of  devices  using  different  technologies  for  communication.  therefore,  different  types  of  gateways  are  used  to  connect  different  technologies  within  the  home  to  provide  access  from  the  home  to  external  services  and  vice  versa.
__label__interactivedisplays as  the  groupedcontrolled  iot  devices  for  this  study,  12  roll  shades  and  eight  smart  bulbs  are  used.  the  roll  shade  device  uses  the  zwave  communication  protocol  and  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  a  zwave  gateway  device  with  an  ethernet  interface.  the  smart  bulb  device  has  the  zigbee  communication  protocol  and  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  the  zigbee  gateway  device  with  a  wifi  interface.  we  have  applied  smart  bulb  devices  as  the  lighting  sources  for  a  living  room,  a  dining  room,  and  a  kitchen.  the  smart  thinq  sensor  is  used  to  detect  the  status  of  the  washer
__label__interactivedisplays and  dryer  using  another  zigbee  communication  device  .  the  device  detects  the  vibration  of  the  washer  and  dryer  and  can  distinguish  the  end  of  the  operation.  in  addition,  a  refrigerator,  an  air  conditioner,  a  robot  cleaner,  and  two  multiroom  speakers  are  used  as  wifi  communication  devices  .  a  motorized  garage  door  opener  and  an  ultrasonic  sensor,  which  can  detect  the  parking  distance  when  a  car  enters  the  parking  lot  and  drives  to  a  reserved  parking  space,  are  used  for  automated  parking  control.  for  the  parking  distance  detection  sensor,  two  ultrasonic  sensors  are  used.  if  a  vehicle  is  correctly  parked  in
__label__interactivedisplays the  parking  lot,  the  light  shows  a  green  color;  otherwise,  the  light  shows  a  red  color.  moreover,  the  status  of  the  sensor  is  transferred  to  a  cloud  platform  and  used  to  automatically  open  the  back  door  located  in  the  parking  lot.  the  proposed  concept  is  substantiated  through  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios,  which  are  described  in  ,  ,  and  :  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  it  is  suggested,  as  a  means  for  the  driver,  for  users  to  make  use  of  the  iot  in  their  daily  living.  we  use  both  the  lifestyle  research
__label__interactivedisplays method  and  the  real  vehicle  testing  method  to  prove  the  concept  and  to  ensure  that  our  study  is  as  realistic  as  possible.  we  assume  that  the  driver  is  a  commuter  and  periodically  visits  several  locations  since  it  is  quite  easy  to  find  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns,  both  before  starting  to  drive  and  after  driving.  the  possible  service  scenarios  of  a  driver  making  use  of  the  iot  in  their  daily  living  are  suggested  as  primary  and  are  designed  to  reduce  the  inconvenience  of  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency.  it  uses  the  vehicular  data  cloud  in  an  iot
__label__interactivedisplays environment  that  has  the  capability  to  integrate  numerous  devices  available  within  the  home  and  devices  in  the  vehicle.  therefore,  we  focus  on  how  cloud  services  could  be  effectively  utilized  for  the  real  lifestyle  when  an  end  user  rides  in  a  vehicle  with  devices  connected  through  the  iot.  scenario  for  an  individual  on  the  way  home.  scenario  for  arriving  at  home.  scenario  for  living  at  home.  scenario  for  leaving  home.  the  first  scenario  is  the  way  to  home.  in  this  scenario,  the  smartphone  is  placed  on  the  wireless  charger  and  the  welcome  message  is  automatically  shown  whenever  the  driver  gets  into
__label__interactivedisplays the  vehicle.  when  a  driver  is  near  his  or  her  vehicle,  the  door  unlocks  and  is  automatically  opened.  moreover,  the  status  information  will  be  sent  to  the  iot  cloud.  it  is  important  to  note  that  these  sensors  can  be  freely  placed  all  around  the  doors  and  doorjambs  since  they  are  relatively  inexpensive.  we  believe  that  they  will  be  triggered  by  an  input  from  the  pressure  or  force  sensors  or  other  types  of  sensors  around  the  doors  and  doorjambs.  a  hypothetical  scenario  could  be  the  enabling  and  integration  of  wireless  sensor  networks  and  the  iot  environment.  the  cloudbased  smart  home  platform
__label__interactivedisplays can  then  determine  the  time  to  transmit  every  control  command.  the  second  scenario  is  for  arriving  at  home.  as  a  driver  arrives  home,  the  vehicle  receives  the  gps  information  and  the  voice  message  is  given  to  the  driver  to  trigger  the  garage  door  opener  remotely.  when  the  driver  gives  the  voicebased  command,  while  in  the  vehicle,  the  garage  door  is  opened  remotely  and  automatically.  when  the  vehicle  is  detected  after  entering  into  the  garage,  the  garage  door  is  closed  automatically  by  the  command  from  the  smart  home  server.  this  action  is  triggered  by  the  parking  distance  detection  sensor.  the  use
__label__interactivedisplays of  parking  distance  sensing  with  two  ultrasonic  sensors  is  designed  to  detect  when  the  vehicle  enters  the  parking  lot  and  heads  to  the  correct  reserved  parking  space.  when  the  vehicle  is  parked  in  the  given  space,  the  smart  home  server  automatically  transmits  a  command  to  open  the  backdoor  lock  located  inside  the  garage.  the  third  scenario  is  for  living  at  home.  this  scenario  assumes  that  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns  are  conducted  automatically  to  minimize  routine  tasks.  sequential  commands  from  the  cloudbased  smart  home  server  are  given  to  turn  on  the  lights,  play  music  from  multiroom  speakers,  and  open  the  grouped  12
__label__interactivedisplays roll  shades.  the  scenario  assumes  that  the  roll  shades  are  initially  closed,  and  the  lights  are  dimmed  prior  to  detecting  any  illumination  changes.  all  types  of  iot  devices  are  controlled  when  voice  commands  are  received  from  the  habitant.  room  illumination  controllers  were  deployed  in  an  actual  house  using  smart  bulbs.  in  addition,  seamless  music  playing  was  conducted  by  multiroom  speakers.  the  refrigerator  and  air  conditioner  could  also  be  controlled  using  the  temperature  information  provided  by  the  nest  built  in  the  house.  the  last  scenario  is  for  leaving  home.  this  scenario  assumes  that  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns  are  conducted  when  the  driver
__label__interactivedisplays or  habitant  leaves  the  home  for  the  same  purpose  of  minimizing  routine  tasks.  the  light  bulbs  and  multiroom  speakers  are  turned  off  and  roll  shades  are  automatically  closed  by  the  opening  of  the  front  door  lock.  this  operation  is  done  after  the  status  of  all  iot  devices  is  checked.  when  the  front  door  lock  is  closed,  the  status  of  the  iot  devices  is  automatically  transferred  to  the  smartphone,  allowing  the  driver  to  verify  the  proper  operation.  in  our  research,  real  vehicle  testing  is  conducted  for  the  way  to  home  and  arriving  at  home  scenarios  and  virtual  home  life  experience  testing
__label__interactivedisplays is  accompanied  for  the  living  at  home  and  leaving  home  scenarios.  for  vehicle  testing,  a  5  km  driving  route  on  an  urban  road,  which  starts  from  the  office  and  ends  at  home,  is  used  to  validate  the  way  to  home  scenario  and  arriving  at  home  scenario.  the  route  guidance  is  given  from  the  google  navigation  and  the  participants  issue  voice  commands  and  check  the  status  according  to  each  command  while  driving.  for  safety,  participants  are  instructed  to  drive  under  a  speed  of  60  km/h.  a  lot  of  efforts  are  needed  to  enhance  the  performance  of  voice  activation  and  voice  recognition.
__label__interactivedisplays specially,  a  huge  acoustic  database  collection  is  necessary  and  an  elaborate  training  procedure  is  required  to  support  the  specific  keyword  recognition  by  anyone.  for  home  testing,  it  is  confirmed  that  each  iot  device  works  correctly  and  properly  according  to  the  voice  command  in  standalone.  as  the  next  step,  interoperability  testing  is  performed  through  various  other  wireless  routers.  the  unreliability  issue  of  voice  recognition  exists  according  to  the  distance  between  the  user  and  natural  language  interface  input  device.  it  is  discovered  that  the  recognition  accuracy  needs  to  be  improved.  in  addition,  system  operational  tasks  such  as  new  device  registration,  device  initialization,
__label__interactivedisplays and  failure  monitoring,  etc.,  need  to  be  tightened  up  to  stabilize  the  smart  home  server.  summarizes  the  evaluation  result  for  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  mentioned  in  .  according  to  the  study,  since  almost  all  of  the  tasks  of  the  first  scenario  to  do  things  like  lock/unlock  the  door,  turn  on  the  a/c,  and  receive  todays  schedule  are  very  routine,  not  so  essential,  and  preferable,  it  is  hard  to  expect  the  greatest  effectiveness  when  it  is  served  automatically  or  controlled  remotely.  above  all,  it  is  insufficient  to  give  simple  information  such  as  the  current  temperature  or  todays  schedule  for  users
__label__interactivedisplays to  feel  comfortable  and  useful.  more  customized  offerings  need  to  be  provided  to  meet  their  expectation  based  on  the  users  preferred  recommendations.  evaluation  summary.  the  experimental  result  of  the  second  scenario  indicates  that  a  special  benefit  can  be  derived  since  it  makes  repetitive  routine  tasks  one  task,  executed  by  a  command.  when  the  driver  approaches  home,  a  voice  command  for  opening  the  garage  door  is  given  and  it  is  used  as  a  triggering  event  for  the  other  sequential  tasks.  it  is  generated  by  detecting  the  location  of  the  house  and  the  remaining  tasks  of  the  scenario  are  executed  automatically  in
__label__interactivedisplays the  perfect  order.  the  driver  is  not  forced  to  get  out  of  the  car  and  he  can  open  and  close  the  garage  door  and  open  the  back  door  of  their  house  without  any  action.  it  can  substitute  routine  and  repetitive  works  for  a  human  being.  of  course,  it  needs  to  be  provided  at  an  appropriate  time  and  with  no  fault.  however,  there  is  the  possibility  that  the  current  voice  command  can  be  replaced  with  another  method  and  user  convenience  can  be  maximized  when  iot  devices  are  fully  connected  in  the  near  future.  in  relation  to  the  third  scenario,  we  realize
__label__interactivedisplays it  is  useful  to  utilize  the  control  command  by  analyzing  the  data  base  acquired  from  the  cloudbased  home  server.  since  it  collects  and  distributes  the  information  from  and  to  the  home  and  vehicles,  it  predicts  personalized  preferences  and  creates  useful  applications  in  various  ways.  in  this  research,  a  limited  number  of  devices  are  integrated  and  the  scenario  is  proposed  to  only  apply  essential  tasks  executed  automatically  without  any  request,  even  if  not  repetitive.  however,  some  scenarios  have  the  capability  to  integrate  numerous  devices,  as  much  as  possible.  for  this  purpose,  it  is  important  that  the  smart  home  platform  is  designed
__label__interactivedisplays to  allow  for  expansion  in  the  scope  and  service  to  offer  special  and  efficient  home  services  for  different  types  of  digital  appliances.  control  commands  should  be  applied  without  any  error,  at  the  right  time,  and  with  authorized  permission.  otherwise,  users  feel  significant  inconvenience  and  will  no  longer  use  these  services.  in  addition,  since  the  status  of  each  device  can  be  changed  at  any  time  by  anyone,  this  can  cause  a  serious  security  situation  or  issue.  for  example,  a  garage  door  can  be  opened  or  the  music  can  be  played  from  the  multiroom  speaker  in  the  middle  of  the  night.  regarding
__label__interactivedisplays the  natural  language  interface  for  home  scenarios,  we  also  find  it  is  very  important  to  maximize  the  accuracy  and  precision,  since  a  voice  signals  conversion  into  text  form  depends  on  the  recognition  distance.  the  fourth  scenario  test  results  show  that  it  is  important  to  sense  the  intention  of  habitants  departure  correctly  as  part  of  the  process  of  gaining  trust  for  their  delegating  work.  it  is  assumed  that  there  are  no  remaining  users  in  the  house  and  the  user  goes  out  for  the  purpose  of  being  away  for  a  long  time.  the  status  of  grouped  iot  devices  is  changed  by  the
__label__interactivedisplays status  transition  of  the  front  door  lock.  it  is  necessary  to  verify  when  control  commands  are  executed  and  the  changed  status  is  transferred  to  habitants.  the  ability  to  receive  the  status  of  iot  devices  remotely  makes  the  user  feel  secure,  even  if  they  do  not  check  the  status  of  the  home  in  advance  before  leaving.  this  is  adapted  in  reality  when  the  user  does  not  have  enough  time  to  check  the  status  or  forgets  to  check  it.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  the  concept  of  a  home  iot  connected  vehicle  with  a  voicebased  virtual  personal  assistant.  the  virtual  personal  assistant
__label__interactivedisplays stays  with  a  driver  to  consistently  assist  while  driving,  at  home,  at  the  office,  or  while  running  errands.  the  system  provides  a  communication  channel  between  the  user  and  the  virtual  personal  assistant  using  a  homogeneous  voicebased  natural  language  interface,  both  in  the  vehicle  and  at  home.  the  proposed  concept  was  evaluated  by  implementing  a  linked  smartphone  and  home  iot  devices  that  were  connected  to  a  vehicles  infotainment  system.  in  addition,  a  smartphonebased  natural  language  interface  input  device  and  cloudbased  home  iot  devices  for  the  home  were  utilized.  several  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  were  substantiated  with  the  aim  of  reducing  the
__label__interactivedisplays inconvenience  of  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency  in  an  iot  environment  by  performing  real  vehicle  testing  and  lifestyle  research.  the  scenarios  included  the  following:  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  this  study  shows  that  it  is  insufficient  to  provide  only  simple  information  such  as  the  current  temperature  or  todays  schedule.  a  remarkable  benefit  is  derived  by  combining  sequentially  repetitive  routine  tasks  into  one  task  or  by  executing  essential  tasks  automatically,  without  any  request.  however,  the  automatic  execution  of  tasks  should  be  used  with  authorized  permission,  applied  without  any
__label__interactivedisplays error  only  at  certain  fixed  times,  and  applied  under  limited  conditions  to  sense  habitants  status  correctly.  this  will  allow  the  habitants  to  gain  trust  regarding  the  remote  execution  of  tasks.  future  work  may  include  more  comprehensive  study  in  relation  to  driving  safety  and  vehicle  security.  the  connected  car  will  be  more  entertaining,  more  efficient  than  traditional  cars,  and  an  advanced  it  technology  such  as  iot  will  provide  new  functionalities,  including  the  hometovehicle  connected  services  proposed  in  this  research.  however,  it  will  inevitably  increase  the  drivers  invehicle  interactions  and  decrease  their  attention  whilst  driving,  potentially  causing  additional  driver  distraction  while  driving.
__label__interactivedisplays in  order  to  mitigate  driver  distraction  while  using  mobile  devices,  a  safer  interaction  design  should  be  considered  under  the  circumstance  of  driving  since  it  is  important  to  consider  safety  first  over  convenience  ,  .  the  connected  car  is  an  interim  step  on  the  way  to  the  truly  autonomous  vehicle,  which  will  free  up  drivers  to  conduct  other  activities  while  en  route  to  work  and  during  trips.  in  this  step,  finding  an  efficient  way  to  optimize  drivers  current  invehicle  use  is  meaningful  and  practical  in  terms  of  road  safety  and  we  believe  that  a  speech  interface  will  certainly  become  an  increasingly
__label__interactivedisplays vital  part  of  how  we  interact  with  our  cars  .  securing  the  connected  car  from  cyberattacks  is  no  easy  task.  additionally,  the  wealth  of  data  available  about  the  cars  and  its  occupantstheir  whereabouts,  driving  habits,  behavior,  preferences,  and  interestswill  need  to  be  carefully  managed,  to  keep  it  private  and  to  decide  who  gets  to  use  it  and  how  .  eventually,  a  cloud  will  benefit  from  iot  by  increasing  its  scope  to  deal  with  existent  world  things,  providing  a  significant  number  of  new  services  for  reallife  applications  such  as  smart  city  ,  smart  surveillance  ,  etc.  however,  a  very  reliable  security
__label__interactivedisplays infrastructure,  including  methods  for  users  to  authenticate,  use  a  twoway  mapping  process  between  users  and  devices,  access  policy  creation  and  enforcement,  logging  and  alerting  capability,  and  secure  communication  should  be  considered  above  all  things.  the  security  challenges  for  the  integration  of  iot  and  cloud  computing,  and  the  secure  integration  of  mobile  devices  into  the  vehicle  must  be  considered  for  the  direction  of  future  research  ,  ,  .  this  work  was  supported  by  the  vehicle  component  technology  center  of  lg  electronics  and  silicon  valley  lab.  of  honda  rd  americas,  inc.  we  would  like  to  thank  sangyong  lee  and  shinichi  akama  for

__label__interactivedisplays present  three  most  popular  options  with  their  advantages  and  disadvantages.  figure  2.  the  internet  of  things  application  using  the  tft  lcd  display  lcd  tft  technology  thanks  to  many  advantages  e.  g.  fast  response  time  is  used  mainly  in  customer  solutions.  efficient  display  of  dynamic,  colorful  content,  allows  you  to  use  it  in  applications,  where  multimedia  is  in  the  first  place.  the  downside  of  this  technology  is  the  high  energy  consumption.  due  to  its  construction,  tft  lcd  are  the  least  energyefficient  devices  among  possibilities  presented  in  the  article.  there  are  many  examples  of  consumer  use  of  lcd  dispalys.  some  of  them
__label__interactivedisplays are  household  appliances,  such  as  sart  washing  machines  or  refrigerators,  various  types  of  controllers,  e.g.  a  thermostat  built  into  the  wall  or  wearable  devices  like  smartwatches.  the  internet  of  things  in  connection  with  tft  lcd  can  be  used  wherever  we  have  access  to  permanent  power  supply  or  where  the  user  dont  mind  more  frequent  charging  of  the  device.  lcd  tft  displays  have  a  builtin  backlight,  so  they  can  be  used  in  places  where  ambient  light  is  dim  or  where  mounting  additional  lighting  is  not  possible.  on  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  tft  lcd  display  in  direct  sunlight  is  problematic
__label__interactivedisplays due  to  the  need  to  mount  a  stronger  backlight,  so  that  the  reflected  light  has  a  lower  value  than  the  light  emitted  by  the  tft  module.  this  solution  may  negatively  affect  the  thickness  of  the  display  and  increase  the  energy  consumption  of  the  device,  and  thus  the  cost  of  use.  figure  3.  iot  application  using  oled  display  due  to  the  lower  prices  in  relation  to  previous  years  and  many  constructional  advantages,  oled  displays  are  more  common  on  the  market  today.  additional  advantages,  in  comparison  to  mono  lcm  modules,  are:  higher  contrast,  faster  reaction  time,  full  viewing  angles  and  lower  energy
__label__interactivedisplays consumption.  increased  energy  efficiency  is  achieved  thanks  to  use  of  an  organic  substance  which  emits  light  itself,  so  oled  displays  do  not  require  an  additional  layer  of  the  backlight.  this  solution  not  only  improves  the  economics  of  use,  but  also  significantly  reduces  the  thickness  of  the  display,  and  thus  the  entire  end  device.  in  this  technology,  the  source  of  the  pixels  itself  are  the  source  of  the  emitted  light.  very  high  contrast  ratio  is  achieved  by  turning  off  the  appropriate  pixels  and  thus  obtaining  perfect  black.  another  advantage,  that  tft  displays  do  not  have,  is  possibility  to  apply  an  organic
__label__interactivedisplays substance  to  a  plastic  substrate.  this  is  the  way  of  creating  flexible  displays,  that  can  be  adapted  to  the  housing  of  the  end  device.  you  can  find  them  in  smartphones,  smartwatches,  or  smart  glasses.  unfortunately,  the  oled  technology  is  still  a  relatively  costly  solution  for  many  manufacturers.  the  price  of  oled  modules  is  still  higher  than  lcd  tft  displays,  while  energy  efficiency  depends  on  the  brightness  and  color  of  the  displayed  content.  the  most  optimal  are  images  with  a  black  background  and  bright  elements.  figure  4.  iot  application  with  epaper  display  figure  5.  iot  application  with  epaper  display  internet  of

__label__interactivedisplays can  think  about  this  effort  in  terms  of  how  the  information  creates  value  and  therefore  assess  dair  in  those  terms.  the  information  value  loop  describes  the  stages  through  which  information  must  pass  to  create  value,  the  technologies  required  to  push  information  around  the  loop,  and  the  characteristics  of  the  data  that  drive  value  see  inset  on  page  5.  by  connecting  the  vehicle  with  inroad  sensors,  dair  created  and  communicated  information,  analyzing  it  to  provide  an  augmented  response  action  in  the  form  of  navigation  and  traffic  information.  in  closed  test  environments,  the  value  was  visible  as  information  completed  the  trip  around
__label__interactivedisplays the  value  loop.  at  commercial  scale,  however,  the  cost  of  putting  the  expensive  sensor  technology  in  place  across  large  stretches  of  road  created  too  tight  a  bottleneck  for  dair  to  be  feasible.  it  did  not  help  that,  for  a  singlecompany  initiative,  there  was  no  larger  ecosystem  in  place  to  spread  the  costs  around.  even  for  the  gm  of  the  1960s,  dair  was  too  great  a  dare.  the  suite  of  technologies  that  enables  the  internet  of  things  promises  to  turn  most  any  object  into  a  source  of  information  about  that  object.  this  creates  both  a  new  way  to  differentiate  products  and
__label__interactivedisplays services  and  a  new  source  of  value  that  can  be  managed  in  its  own  right.  realizing  the  iots  full  potential  motivates  a  framework  that  captures  the  series  and  sequence  of  activities  by  which  organizations  create  value  from  information:  the  information  value  loop.  for  information  to  complete  the  loop  and  create  value,  it  passes  through  the  loops  stages  ,  each  enabled  by  specific  technologies  .  an  act  is  monitored  by  a  sensor  that  creates  information,  that  information  passes  through  a  network  so  that  it  can  be  communicated  ,  and  standards  be  they  technical,  legal,  regulatory,  or  socialallow  that  information  to  be
__label__interactivedisplays aggregated  across  time  and  space.  augmented  intelligence  is  a  generic  term  meant  to  capture  all  manner  of  analytical  support,  collectively  used  to  analyze  information.  the  loop  is  completed  via  augmented  behavior  technologies  that  either  enable  automated  autonomous  action  or  shape  human  decisions  in  a  manner  leading  to  improved  action.  getting  information  around  the  value  loop  allows  an  organization  to  create  value;  how  much  value  is  created  is  a  function  of  the  value  drivers  ,  which  capture  the  characteristics  of  the  information  that  makes  its  way  around  the  value  loop.  the  drivers  of  information  value  can  be  captured  and  sorted  into
__label__interactivedisplays the  three  categories:  magnitude,  risk,  and  time  .  when  gps  technologies  were  opened  up  to  civilian  use  in  1996,  gm  announced  onstar  in  collaboration  with  eds  and  hughes  electronics.  as  originally  introduced,  every  connected  car  would  have  a  digital  communication  module  dcm,  essentially  a  phone  embedded  in  the  vehicle,  responsible  for  communicating  information  wirelessly  to  a  telematics  service  provider  tsp  or  the  automaker  itself.  in  a  breakthrough  we  categorize  as  phase  1,  this  connected  the  car  to  information  and  services  from  the  outside  world  to  enable  a  safer  and  easier  driving  experience.  onstars  success  is  clear  in  terms  of  its
__label__interactivedisplays ability  to  effectively  push  the  right  kinds  of  information  around  the  value  loop.  for  example,  safety  services  leverage  sensors  embedded  in  the  vehicle  aggregating  information  that  the  car  creates  and  communicates  associated  with  safetyrelated  events  and  emergency  situations.  navigation  services  use  gps  technology  to  ascertain  the  autos  location.  analysis  of  the  information  enables  the  provider  to  use  augmentedbehavior  technologies  to  act  on  the  customers  behalffrom  dispatching  emergency  services  to  the  site  of  a  crashed  vehicle  to  providing  live  concierge  services  over  the  invehicle  phone.  the  timeliness,  reliability,  and  accuracy  of  information  are  the  most  critical  value  drivers,  due  to  the
__label__interactivedisplays importance  of  rapid  response  in  emergency  situations  and  the  legal  implications  of  safety  failures.  the  automotive  ecosystem  was  becoming  more  than  just  the  car  and  its  maker.  unlike  the  closed  dair  ecosystem,  onstars  ecosystem  brought  in  two  new  players:  the  hardware  providers  and  tier  2  chip  providers  that  supplied  the  dcm  devices  and  the  tsps  that  provided  the  core  services.  the  new  hardware  providers,  operating  similarly  to  existing  tier  1  providers,  fit  within  existing  power  structures.  the  tsps,  however,  represented  an  important  shift:  automakers  introduction  of  embedded  safety  services  expanded  their  business  models  beyond  product  manufacturing  and  retail  into  service

__label__interactivedisplays according  to  these  same  rules.  by  the  mid2000s,  the  nearubiquity  of  mobile  phones  and  the  rapid  rise  of  smartphones  prompted  the  introduction  of  infotainment  applications  within  the  vehicle.  these  applications  were  built  on  a  drivers  broughtin  phone  using  a  phones  cellular  connection  to  stream  data  to  the  vehicle  via  bluetooth  rather  than  embedded  hardware  as  with  dair  or  onstar.  the  connected  capabilities  within  the  car  aimed  to  duplicate  entertainment  and  features  a  driver  could  get  elsewhere  at  home  or  on  their  phone  rather  than  providing  a  wholly  new  stream  of  featuresand  new  kinds  of  value.  even  so,  this  signaled  a

__label__interactivedisplays a  small  bird  crosses  its  path.  that  is  not  say  we  are  about  to  become  obsolete.  for  the  foreseeable  future,  human  judgement  is  still  critical  and  were  not  at  the  stage  of  abandoning  complex  judgement  calls  to  algorithms.  while  we  are  in  the  process  of  handing  over  anything  that  can  be  automated  with  some  intelligence,  complex  human  judgement  is  still  needed.  as  times  goes  on,  artificial  ai  judgement  will  be  improved  but  the  balance  is  delicate  not  least  because  of  the  clear  and  obvious  concerns  over  safety.  staying  safe  on  the  road  is  understandably  one  of  the  biggest  focuses  when
__label__interactivedisplays it  comes  to  automated  means  of  transportation.  a  2017  study  by  deloitte  found  that  threequarters  of  americans  do  not  trust  autonomous  vehicles.  perhaps  this  is  unsurprising  as  trust  in  new  technology  takes  time  it  took  many  years  before  people  lost  fear  of  being  rocketed  through  the  stratosphere  at  500  mph  in  an  aeroplane.  there  can,  and  should,  be  no  limit  to  the  analytics  being  applied  to  every  aspect  of  autonomous  driving  from  the  manufacturers,  to  the  technology  companies,  understanding  each  granular  piece  of  information  is  critical.  but,  it  is  happening.  researchers  at  the  massachusetts  institute  of  technology  are  asking  people

__label__interactivedisplays the  outlines  of  a  datadriven  connected  car  market  are  emerging  with  the  rise  of  infrastructure  and  vehicletoeverything  communications  seen  as  key  drivers  of  growth,  a  new  analysis  concludes.  a  growing  list  of  established  networking  vendors  also  are  creating  an  emerging  use  case  for  the  internet  of  things,  observers  note.  by  2022,  market  watcher  juniper  research  forecasts  that  50  percent  of  all  passenger  cars  will  have  at  least  one  network  connection.  as  car  makers  and  network  operators  join  with  developers  of  socalled  v2x  services,  the  connected  car  market  is  expected  to  expand  at  roughly  a  21percent  annual  rate  over  the  next
__label__interactivedisplays five  years  to  an  estimated  49.2  billion,  the  researcher  said  in  a  report  released  monday  june  19.  among  the  emerging  applications  for  v2x  services  are  automated  payments  for  gas,  parking  and  tolls.  early  rollouts  of  infrastructure  could  take  up  to  five  years  to  implement,  allowing  stakeholders  time  to  cultivate  pertinent  use  cases  such  as  iot,  the  market  researcher  stressed.  meanwhile,  connected  car  infrastructure  and  services  will  require  buyin  not  only  from  automakers  but  also  from  other  stakeholders  who  will  need  to  forge  publicprivate  partnerships.  that  view  is  based  on  the  notion  that  cars  are  becoming  mobile  data  platforms  and,  according
__label__interactivedisplays to  juniper  analyst  sam  baker,  level  of  service  will  be  more  important  to  drivers  than  vehicle  performance  itself.  along  with  v2x  communications,  consumers  are  expected  to  opt  in  larger  numbers  for  ,  which  uses  wireless  devices  to  transmit  realtime  data  related  to  vehicle  use  and  maintenance  requirements.  juniper  forecasts  that  consumers  will  spend  more  than  100  billion  by  2022,  creating  major  incentives  to  invest  in  rolling  out  vehicletoinfrastructure  services.  those  services  will  include  emergency  response,  weather  and  road  condition  updates,  navigation  and  smart  city  integration,  the  researcher  predicted.  meanwhile,  network  operators  are  expected  to  be  among  the  key  telematics  service

__label__interactivedisplays to  plan  measures  to  help  their  drivers  be  both  more  efficient  and  also  safer  on  the  road.  in  addition  to  driver  monitoring,  companies  can  also  use  iot  sensors  to  monitor  fuel  levels  in  each  vehicle.  abnormal  fuel  usage  rates  may  indicate  leaks  or  efficiency  issues  in  the  vehicle,  alerting  managers  to  potential  maintenance  needs.  thus,  fuel  monitoring  is  a  powerful  tool.  in  addition,  a  sudden  drop  in  fuel  could  indicate  fuel  theft,  enabling  companies  to  better  protect  their  mobile  assets  and  recover  from  losses.  monitoring  systems  allow  fleet  managers  to  keep  a  close  eye  on  conditions  within  the  vehicle.  for
__label__interactivedisplays instance,  sensors  can  detect  when  doors  open  or  when  temperatures  change  in  climatecontrolled  vehicles.  this  alerts  fleet  managers  to  potential  product  loss  or  theft.  these  sensors  can  also  help  alert  fleet  managers  to  maintenance  needs.  for  example,  if  the  temperature  tends  to  rise  too  much  in  a  refrigerated  truck,  there  could  be  an  issue  with  the  refrigeration  system  that  needs  to  be  taken  care  of.  most  of  the  monitoring  systems  used  in  fleet  vehiclesincluding  the  aforementioned  fuel  monitoring,  driver  monitoring,  and  loss  prevention  systemscan  be  used  in  predictive  maintenance.  additional  sensors  used  to  monitor  the  engine,  tire  pressure,  and  other
__label__interactivedisplays components  of  the  vehicle  add  to  the  data  used  in  anticipating  upcoming  maintenance  needs.  for  example,  gps  data  indicating  slow  braking  by  the  driver  combined  with  other  sensor  readings  could  indicate  that  theres  an  issue  with  the  brake  system.  excessive  fuel  usage  combined  with  engine  readings  might  indicate  a  developing  problem  thats  impacting  fuel  efficiency.  by  analyzing  the  data,  its  possible  to  predict  when  is  needed  on  fleet  vehicles,  allowing  fleet  managers  to  cut  down  on  maintenance  costs.  ryan  chan  is  ceo  and  founder  at  upkeep  maintenance  management.  he  is  a  chemical  engineer  from  uc  berkeley  and  was  named  one
