__label__assetoperationsoptimization provide  best  performance  thanks  to  the  fact  that  the  chunk  size  is  dynamically  tuned  according  to  the  measured  update  percentage.  this  fact  can  be  appreciated  especially  for  high  update  percentages,  where  other  fixed  chunk  sizebased  algorithm  are  inefficient.  as  explained  in  ,  the  ac  rdiff  algorithm  considers  a  lower  bound  regarding  the  minimum  chunk  size,  while  ah  rdiff  has  no  constraints  since  if  the  chunk  dimension  is  lower  than  the  signature  sum  size,  the  system  simply  switches  from  the  signaturebased  to  the  signaturefree  approach.  for  this  reason,  is  better  performing  than  .  the  same  analysis  reported  in  has  been  performed

__label__assetoperationsoptimization time  and  the  amount  of  bytes  to  be  transmitted  to  the  cloud.  this  fact  is  confirmed  by  the  results  in  where  it  is  possible  to  observe  how  all  the  considered  algorithms  show  better  performance  with  respect  to  the  previous  case  of  .  however,  the  higher  efficiency  of  ac  rdiff  and  ah  rdiff  mechanisms  is  clearly  evident  even  in  this  scenario.  performance  of  the  considered  file  synchronization  algorithms  as  a  function  of  the  file  update  percentage.  burst  updates  distribution  within  the  file  is  assumed.  finally,  we  have  simulated  30  consecutive  file  synchronization  procedures,  reporting  in  the  average  traffic  percentage  generated  according

__label__assetoperationsoptimization we  observe  that  the  choice  of  file  dimension  equal  to  3  kb  does  not  limit  validity  of  the  results,  since  the  goal  of  the  proposed  analysis  is  to  evaluate  the  byte  trafficsaving  percentage  provided  by  the  considered  algorithms.  in  fact,  file  synchronization  protocols  can  handle  dimension  mismatching  between  the  diot  and  cloud  files.  in  general,  it  is  important  to  observe  that,  when  the  chunk  dimension  is  similar  to  the  entire  file  size,  static  chunkbased  algorithms  are  inefficient  since  it  is  hard  to  find  matching  chunks  if  a  significant  part  of  the  file  needs  to  be  updated.  on  the  other  hand,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization when  the  file  dimension  grows  with  respect  to  the  chunk,  the  performance  improves.  however,  thanks  to  the  adaptive  approach,  ac  rdiff  and  ah  rdiff  are  essentially  not  sensitive  to  the  file  size,  thus  providing  good  performance  in  any  scenario.  the  results  obtained  from  the  data  traffic  analysis  have  been  exploited  to  measure  the  diot  power  consumption.  the  reference  signatures  selfgeneration  approach  characterizing  the  diot  allows  the  energy  spent  for  data  reception  to  be  neglected,  so  we  have  simplified  the  measure  of  power  consumption  of  equation  by  only  referring  to  the  transmission  component.  by  doing  so,  we  can  evaluate  how  the

__label__assetoperationsoptimization volumes  in  the  order  of  kilobytes  as  considered  in  the  simulations  makes  use  of  sigfox  unfeasible  since  the  very  low  data  rate  characterizing  this  technology  unavoidably  leads  to  long  transmission  times  and,  therefore,  to  high  power  consumption.  on  the  other  hand,  lora/lorawan  and  nbiot  are  better  suited  to  the  considered  traffic  volume.  however,  the  presented  scenario  with  3  kb  files  daily  updating  is  quite  unusual  in  the  iot,  since  the  amount  of  exchanged  data  is  typically  much  lower.  we  have  intentionally  chosen  this  framework  to  stress  the  performance  provided  by  the  proposed  synchronization  algorithms.  moreover,  considering  more  realistic  circumstances  where
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  daily  traffic  volume  is  in  the  order  of  a  few  hundreds  of  bytes,  the  battery  lifetime  values  in  will  increase,  reaching  the  510  years  life  usually  claimed  for  iot  devices.  this  paper  dealt  with  data  synchronization  in  iot  lpwans.  in  this  context,  two  adaptive  algorithms,  namely  ac  rdiff  and  ah  rdiff  ,  have  been  presented  to  optimize  the  amount  of  data  to  be  exchanged  when  the  synchronization  between  a  diot  and  the  cloud  is  performed.  the  aim  is  to  reduce  the  amount  of  traffic  exchanged,  still  preserving  the  ideal  synchronization,  thus  saving  energy  and  increasing  the  diot  lifetime.  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization performance  analysis  here  reported  has  highlighted  a  significant  traffic  volume  saving  when  the  proposed  algorithms  are  used  with  respect  to  other  solutions  currently  adopted  in  remote  synchronization.  furthermore,  reducing  the  data  to  be  transmitted  leads  also  to  improve  the  diot  energy  saving,  representing  a  very  challenging  issue  in  the  iot,  and  therefore  extending  device  battery  lifetime.  future  works  will  consider  a  more  complex  scenario  where  multiple  diots  share  the  same  cloud  storage  resources.  in  that  case,  an  opportune  time  synchronization  protocol  among  parties  must  be  provided  to  let  both  the  cloud  and  diots  perform  file  updates  without  incurring  problems  of

__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  iot  landscape.  our  analysis  uncovered  three  major  findings.  one,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  the  internet  of  things:  todays  market  is  heavily  driven  by  specific  use  case  scenarios.  two,  while  in  the  aggregate,  companies  will  spend  an  incremental  250  billion  on  iot  in  2020  over  and  above  their  normal  technology  spending,  three  industries  will  account  for  approximately  50  of  that  spending.  and  three,  although  all  layers  of  the  iot  technology  stack  are  poised  to  grow  through  2020,  the  layers  are  not  equally  attractive.  from  2015  through  2020,  all  layers  of  the  technology  stack  are  expected  to  have  achieved
__label__assetoperationsoptimization a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  at  least  20,  but  certain  layers  have  much  higher  growth  potential  than  others.  see  exhibit  1.  iots  real  value,  from  the  customers  perspective,  is  in  the  top  two  layers  of  the  technology  stack;  that  is,  services  and  iot  analytics  and  applications.  we  expect  that  by  2020  these  two  layers  will  have  captured  60  of  the  growth  from  iot.  the  rest  of  the  technology  stackidentity  and  security,  iot  backbone  cloud  and  platform,  communications,  and  connected  thingsare  enabling  components  with  lower  growth  potential.  companies  will  likely  spend  some  250  billion  on  iot,  but  they  need  to
__label__assetoperationsoptimization know  which  iot  applications  have  the  potential  to  deliver  the  most  value.  determining  this  requires  recognizing  that  business  leaders  are  using  iot  to  solve  discrete  business  challenges.  theyre  asking,  how  can  iot  help  our  company  increase  customer  satisfaction,  improve  quality,  support  new  business  models  such  as  datadriven  services,  and  reduce  costs?  a  few  use  cases  are  driving  iot  adoption  and  growth  and  will  continue  to  do  so  through  2020  at  least.  to  gain  meaningful  market  share  over  the  near  term,  companies  need  to  focus  their  iot  product  offerings  on  the  right  use  cases.  with  this  in  mind,  we  identified  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization wide  range  of  use  cases  for  iot.  from  this  long  list,  we  pinpointed  ten  iot  use  cases  that  are  poised  to  mature  rapidly  and  experience  widespread  adoption  in  a  b2b  context  through  2020.  see  exhibit  2.  insight  into  where  customers  plan  to  invest  in  iot,  when  they  will  invest,  and  how  much  they  plan  to  spend  helps  clarify  which  use  cases  will  drive  iot  growth  through  2020.  ten  iot  use  cases  show  the  most  promise.  .  inevitably,  businesses  lose  valuable  time  and  money  when  equipment  malfunctions  or  breaks  down.  and  many  companies  also  lose  money  each  year  by  adhering  to
__label__assetoperationsoptimization fixed  maintenance  schedules  by  which  equipment  vendors  make  routine  callseven  when  no  maintenance  is  required.  iot  technologies  can  predict  or  detect  when  a  machine  requires  maintenance,  reducing  or  eliminating  unplanned  downtime,  extending  maintenance  cycles,  and  reducing  costs.  a  host  of  industriesincluding  discrete  manufacturing,  transportation  and  logistics,  energy,  and  health  carecan  benefit  from  predictive  maintenance.  of  course,  solutions  need  to  be  tailored  to  suit  specific  industry  needs  and  applications.  connected  factories  and  plants  can  use  iot  to  monitor  and  optimize  production  processes  in  real  time,  making  automated  adjustments  to  improve  quality,  enhance  efficiency,  and  reduce  waste.  this  use  case  is  ideal
__label__assetoperationsoptimization for  discrete  manufacturing  and  process  industries.  iot  can  provide  much  greater  insight  into  the  status  of  inventory  and  the  supply  chain,  allowing  companies  to  track  inventory  location  and  condition  including,  for  example,  temperature,  humidity,  and  damage.  the  ability  to  monitor  products  across  the  supply  chain  allows  companies  to  increase  processing  and  response  time,  reduce  stockouts  and  inventory  pileups,  and  improve  justintime  production  processes.  physicians  can  track  patient  health  remotely,  in  real  time,  to  improve  health  outcomes  and  reduce  health  care  costs.  by  tracking  patient  data  and  monitoring  compliance,  health  care  providers  can  help  patients  stay  healthier  and  recover  more  quickly.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sensors  can  be  used  to  monitor  utilitiesincluding  electricity,  gas,  and  water  consumptionin  real  time.  smart  meters  can  help  consumers  monitor  their  usage,  reduce  the  number  of  technicians  needed  to  read  meters,  provide  realtime  billing  data,  and  enable  more  dynamic  pricing.  iot  sensors  are  ideally  suited  for  increasing  systems  efficiency.  they  can,  for  example,  enhance  transparency  in  order  fulfillment  and  provide  information  that  can  help  reduce  workstation  transition  times.  the  sensors  can  be  used  in  the  assembly  area  to  identify  the  status  of  products  and  to  locate  tools,  components,  and  materials.  iot  can  be  used  to  automate  and  optimize  supply  and

__label__assetoperationsoptimization sensing  event  scheduling  algorithm  is  highly  desired.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  novel  modeling  methodology  and  optimization  algorithm  for  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications.  we  initially  extend  the  traditional  petri  nets  with  sensing  event  factor.  then,  the  formal  modeling  specification  is  investigated  and  the  existing  coordination  patterns,  including  event  unicasting  pattern,  event  broadcasting  pattern,  and  service  collaboration  pattern,  are  defined.  next,  we  propose  an  optimization  algorithm  based  on  dynamic  priority  first  response  dpfr  to  solve  the  problem  of  sensing  event  scheduling.  finally,  the  approach  presented  in  this  paper  has  been  validated  to  be  valid  and  implemented  through  an
__label__assetoperationsoptimization actual  development  system.  iot  brings  together  physical  sensors  which  have  never  been  connected  before.  these  sensors  are  the  fundamental  building  blocks  for  the  creation  of  smart  applications  and  communicate  via  devicetodevice  connections  ,  .  as  we  know,  the  iotaware  business  process  applications  are  eventdriven  by  nature  .  therefore,  the  business  processes  hosted  on  the  widespread  geographical  distribution  sensors  should  respond  to  different  sensing  events  gathered  in  the  dynamic  iot  environment  as  fast  as  they  could.  the  realtime  event  handling  not  only  makes  the  cooperation  among  crosssensor  business  processes  more  efficient,  but  also  makes  it  possible  to  invoke  corrective  processes  before
__label__assetoperationsoptimization emergencies  snowball  into  disasters  e.g.,  traffic  congestion,  fire  hazard,  power  emergency,  etc  .  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  a  typical  crosssensor  business  process  application,  especially  in  largescale  application  scenarios,  is  usually  dispersed  in  different  monitoring  areas.  due  to  the  discrete  distribution  of  sensors  and  the  complexity  of  execution  environment,  they  need  to  collaborate  to  accomplish  specific  tasks  .  therefore,  different  kinds  of  coordination  patterns  exist  in  the  heterogeneous  smart  sensor  networks,  which  make  modeling  more  difficult.  in  general,  the  common  coordination  patterns  in  the  iot  environment  include  event  unicasting  pattern,  event  broadcasting  pattern,  and  service  collaboration  pattern.  in  order  to
__label__assetoperationsoptimization comprehensively  respond  to  external  sensing  events,  massive  data  gathered  by  the  smart  sensors  are  routed,  forwarded,  and  processed  among  iotaware  business  process  applications  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks.  however,  the  available  resource,  especially  the  computing  resource,  is  often  limited  in  a  particular  scene  .  for  example,  in  the  modern  forestprotection,  numerous  smart  sensors  are  discretely  deployed  in  multiple  monitoring  areas.  these  sensors  communicate  via  sensing  events  and  share  the  same  remote  computing  resource.  these  sensing  events  not  only  have  a  huge  number,  but  also  have  complex  data  formats,  including  text,  image,  and  video.  furthermore,  different  kinds  of  sensing  events  are
__label__assetoperationsoptimization assigned  different  priorities.  but,  all  of  them  tend  to  get  response  from  the  iotsystem  as  fast  as  possible.  thus,  it  is  particularly  important  to  reasonably  schedule  all  kinds  of  sensing  events  based  on  certain  principles  with  limited  computing  resource.  as  a  tool  to  model  discrete  event  systems,  petri  nets  have  been  widely  used  to  model  the  business  process  applications,  which  have  shown  great  power  in  dealing  with  concurrences  and  conflicts.  therefore,  in  this  paper,  the  modeling  methodology  for  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications  is  investigated  on  the  basis  of  petri  nets.  although  petri  nets  could  provide  theoretical  supports  for
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  modeling  and  analysis,  challenges  still  remain  to  be  solved.  first  of  all,  the  business  processes  towards  iot  applications  are  eventdriven  by  nature.  but  petri  nets  only  concern  about  the  control  structures,  including  sequence  structure,  andsplit/join  structure,  xorsplit/join  structure,  and  loop  structure,  without  taking  into  account  the  sensing  event  factor  involved  in  the  process  interactions.  thus,  we  need  to  extend  petri  nets  with  this  factor.  furthermore,  due  to  the  discrete  distribution  and  complex  sensing  environment,  multiple  coordination  patterns  exist  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks.  however,  to  our  best  knowledge,  most  of  the  current  work  pays  little  attention  to  the  systematic
__label__assetoperationsoptimization description  and  formal  definition  for  coordination  patterns  in  the  business  process  modeling  phase.  finally,  massive  sensing  events  need  to  be  routed,  forwarded,  and  processed  in  the  resourceconstrained  iot  environment.  all  of  them  tend  to  be  scheduled  as  fast  as  possible.  most  of  the  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms  ,  ,  ,  only  focus  on  the  technical  implementation  details,  lacking  a  qualitative  and  quantitative  analysis  that  combines  the  specific  iot  application  scenario.  the  main  contributions  of  our  work  contain  the  following:  the  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  we  discuss  the  related  work  in  section  .  section  describes  a  scenario

__label__assetoperationsoptimization recurring  realtime  tasks.  they  focused  on  the  nonpreemptive  uniprocessor  case  and  obtained  scheduletheoretic  results  for  this  case.  the  abovementioned  approaches  are  generally  still  in  their  infancies.  the  work  and  only  focus  the  discrete  business  processes  without  considering  coordination  patterns  among  different  process  tasks.  our  approach  takes  full  account  of  the  complexity  of  iot  sensing  environment.  we  give  the  formal  modeling  specification  of  sensor  tasks  and  define  different  coordination  patterns.  the  work  also  extends  petri  nets  with  message  and  resource  factors.  but  the  premise  of  this  extension  is  not  to  consider  resource  conflicts.  however,  the  available  computing  resource  is  often  limited
__label__assetoperationsoptimization in  a  particular  scene.  therefore,  we  propose  the  corresponding  algorithm  to  optimize  sensing  event  scheduling.  although  the  studies  ,  ,  have  presented  some  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms,  most  of  their  approaches  are  based  on  software  simulation,  which  lacks  theory  basic  that  combines  the  specific  iot  application  scenario.  different  to  them,  we  initially  verify  the  feasibility  and  effectiveness  of  our  proposed  optimization  algorithm  at  the  theoretical  level.  then,  we  consider  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects  for  the  performance  evaluation  of  the  algorithm.  a  large  area  of  forest  is  widely  distributed  in  north  china.  the  work  of  forestprotection  used  to  be  done
__label__assetoperationsoptimization by  the  way  of  human  mountaineering  in  the  past.  however,  this  way  not  only  costs  a  lot  of  resources,  but  also  could  not  deal  with  emergencies  in  realtime.  using  our  proposed  approach,  numerous  smart  sensors  are  discretely  deployed  in  multiple  monitoring  areas.  these  sensors  are  in  charge  of  collecting  their  surrounding  information  and  sending  the  corresponding  sensing  events  to  gateways  regularly.  owing  to  inconsistency  of  the  raw  data,  event  manager  will  initially  do  some  basic  filtering  or  aggregation  operations.  then,  encapsulated  events  are  routed,  forwarded,  and  computed  among  business  process  applications  hosted  on  the  distributed  servers.  finally,  valuable  information  would
__label__assetoperationsoptimization be  submitted  to  officers  for  further  processing  and  analyzing.  in  general,  a  typical  scenario  of  modern  forestprotection  usually  involves  the  following  sensors:  smoke  sensor,  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor,  tracking  camera  sensor,  light  sensor,  and  sound  sensor.  furthermore,  the  common  physical  resources  include  the  firefighters,  fireengines,  and  fireairplanes.  officers  would  allocate  these  resources  according  to  the  need.  figure  illustrates  the  whole  business  process  application  of  this  case.  figure  1:  in  general,  this  scenario  includes  the  following  steps:  the  interaction  interface  between  the  discrete  business  processes  is  eventbased  loosely  coupled.  when  emergencies  occur,  the  appropriate  business  processes  could  be  invoked  to  handle
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  corresponding  events  timely.  according  to  this  specific  description,  we  could  summarize  the  following  characteristics  of  these  business  processes.  table  1:  to  better  analyze  and  optimize  the  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications,  we  should  first  have  a  complete  modeling  method.  in  this  section,  we  initially  introduce  the  formal  modeling  specification  for  singlesensing  sensor  node.  then,  different  kinds  of  coordination  patterns  are  investigated  and  formally  defined.  finally,  we  model  the  abovementioned  forestprotection  business  process  application  based  on  our  proposed  approach.  in  the  traditional  petri  netsbased  business  process  modeling,  a  task  is  usually  composed  of  task  name  and  task  attribute.  considering
__label__assetoperationsoptimization that  the  business  processes  usually  involve  all  kinds  of  sensing  events  in  the  dynamic  iot  environment,  we  extend  the  traditional  petri  nets  with  this  factor.  a  petri  net  is  a  model  that  could  be  represented  by  a  graph.  definition  1:  is  a  net  if  and  only  definition  2:  let  denote  any  element  of  a  net  n  .  given  is  called  the  input  set  or  preset  of  x  ,  and  is  the  output  set  or  postset  of  x  .  is  called  a  pure  net  if  it  satisfies  definition  3:  a  4tuple  is  a  petri  net  if  and  only  if  m  m
__label__assetoperationsoptimization m  t  m  m  in  the  traditional  petri  netsbased  modeling,  the  transition  t  is  used  to  represent  the  tasks.  considering  that  the  iotaware  business  processes  usually  involve  sensing  events,  we  extend  the  traditional  petri  nets  with  this  factor.  definition  4:  a  5tuple  is  an  extended  petri  net  if  the  following  conditions  hold.  i  o  t  compared  with  the  traditional  petri  nets,  the  main  differences  defined  in  definition  4  are  as  follows:  i  as  mentioned  above,  a  sensor  task  is  usually  composed  of  sensor  name,  task  item,  subscribed  event,  and  published  event.  thus,  the  specification  of  a  single  sensor  node  is
__label__assetoperationsoptimization formally  defined  as  follows.  definition  5:  a  sensor  task  is  a  fourtuple  then,  each  item  of  the  sensor  task  is  interpreted  as  follows.  using  our  extended  petri  nets  model,  a  sensor  task  is  described  by  a  transition  which  has  one  input  place  and  one  output  place,  representing  the  start  and  end  of  the  sensor  task,  respectively.  due  to  the  importance  of  sensing  events,  their  corresponding  places  are  added  in  this  model.  thus,  a  formal  model  for  single  sensor  node  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  is  the  start  place  and  is  the  end  place.  is  the  sensing  event  place  which  represents
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  subscribed  sensing  event  when  a  sensor  task  starts.  similarly,  is  the  sensing  event  place  which  represents  the  published  sensing  event  when  a  task  of  the  smart  sensor  has  been  finished.  it  is  worth  to  note  that  each  sensing  event  has  its  own  priority,  which  is  defined  as  a  constant  in  the  sensing  event  place  and  could  be  modified  by  the  event  manager.  to  distinguish  the  common  place  and  sensing  event  place,  they  are  drawn  as  normal  circle  and  double  circle  with  dashed  border.  moreover,  directed  arc  drawn  with  full  border  represents  the  control  flow  and  while  directed  arc  drawn
__label__assetoperationsoptimization with  dashed  border  represents  the  data  flow.  taking  the  scenario  we  mentioned  above  as  an  instance,  the  tracking  camera  sensor  is  denoted  as  its  corresponding  model  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  figure  2:  figure  3:  due  to  the  discrete  distribution  of  sensors  and  the  complexity  of  iot  sensing  environment,  they  need  to  collaborate  to  accomplish  specific  tasks.  therefore,  different  kinds  of  coordination  patterns  exist  among  business  processes,  including  event  unicasting  pattern,  event  broadcasting  pattern,  and  service  collaboration  pattern.  in  this  section,  we  define  these  coordination  patterns  based  on  extended  petri  nets.  if  two  tasks  affiliate  to  the  different  smart  sensors,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization one  sensor  publishes  an  event,  and  the  other  one  just  needs  to  subscribe  this  event  during  execution  phase.  then,  we  say  that  event  unicasting  pattern  exists  between  them.  definition  6  describes  this  coordination  pattern.  definition  6:  let  and  be  two  different  smart  sensor  nodes.  then  and  are  two  different  fourtuples.  event  unicasting  pattern  exists  between  these  two  smart  sensors  if  the  following  conditions  hold.  we  take  abovementioned  scenario  of  collaborative  business  processes  in  forestprotection  as  an  example.  task  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor  is  denoted  as  and  the  task  smoke  sensor  is  formalized  as  ,  obviously,  these  two  business  processes  belong
__label__assetoperationsoptimization to  different  kinds  of  sensors;  therefore,  conditions  1  and  2  in  definition  6  are  satisfied.  in  addition,  the  smoke  event  published  by  smoke  senor  is  subscribed  by  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor;  therefore,  condition  3  in  definition  6  is  also  satisfied.  in  this  way,  according  to  definition  6,  event  unicasting  pattern  exists  between  them.  figure  illustrates  this  coordination  pattern.  figure  4:  if  tasks  affiliate  to  the  different  sensors,  one  sensor  task  publishes  a  sensing  event,  which  needs  to  be  subscribed  by  two  or  more  sensor  tasks.  then,  we  claim  that  event  broadcasting  pattern  exists  between  them.  definition  7  describes  this  coordination
__label__assetoperationsoptimization pattern.  definition  7:  let  ,  and  be  different  smart  sensor  nodes.  then  and  are  different  fourtuples.  event  broadcasting  pattern  exists  between  these  smart  sensors  if  the  following  conditions  hold.  we  take  abovementioned  scenario  of  collaborative  business  processes  in  forestprotection  as  an  example.  task  tracking  camera  sensor  is  denoted  as  task  light  sensor  is  formalized  and  task  sound  sensor  is  formalized  obviously,  these  three  sensors  belong  to  different  monitoring  areas;  therefore,  conditions  1  and  2  in  definition  7  are  satisfied.  in  addition,  the  light  sensor  and  sound  sensor  both  subscribe  the  alarm  event  published  by  tracking  camera  sensor;  therefore,  condition  3
__label__assetoperationsoptimization in  definition  7  is  also  satisfied.  in  this  way,  according  to  definition  7,  event  broadcasting  pattern  exists  among  them.  figure  illustrates  this  coordination  pattern.  figure  5:  if  one  specific  task  requires  multiple  sensor  tasks  to  collaborate  with  each  other,  then  we  claim  that  service  collaboration  pattern  exists  between  them.  definition  8  describes  this  coordination  pattern.  definition  8:  let  and  be  two  different  smart  sensor  nodes.  then  and  are  two  different  fourtuples.  service  collaboration  pattern  exists  between  these  two  smart  sensors  if  the  following  conditions  hold.  we  take  abovementioned  scenario  of  collaborative  business  processes  in  forestprotection  as  an  example.  task  light
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sensor  is  formalized  as  and  the  task  sound  sensor  is  formalized  as  obviously,  the  task  item,  subscribed  event,  and  published  event  are  same,  but  the  task  of  alarm  target  is  executed  by  light  sensor  and  sound  sensor  together.  therefore,  according  to  definition  8,  service  collaboration  pattern  exists  between  them.  the  collaboration  service  is  drawn  as  a  rectangle  with  dashed  borders.  figure  illustrates  this  coordination  pattern.  figure  6:  in  general,  the  modeling  for  collaborative  business  processes  towards  iot  applications  in  the  forestprotection  scenario  includes  the  following  steps:  figure  7:  so  far,  the  complete  modeling  approach  of  this  collaborative  business  process  towards
__label__assetoperationsoptimization iot  applications  in  the  forestprotection  scenario  has  been  obtained  and  depicted  in  figure  .  based  on  this  model,  we  could  further  analyze  and  optimize  this  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  application.  figure  8:  in  the  previous  section,  we  have  introduced  the  formal  modeling  method  for  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications  in  the  forestprotection  scenario  using  extended  petri  nets.  based  on  this  extended  petri  nets  model,  its  corresponding  sequence  diagram  could  be  easily  obtained,  which  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  as  we  see,  the  response  sequence  for  tracking  camera  senor,  light  sensor,  and  sound  sensor  is  uncertain.  furthermore,  besides  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization firerelated  sensors,  other  sensors  e.g.,  temperature  sensor,  humidity  sensor,  carbon  dioxide  sensor,  etc  are  also  deployed  in  the  forest  and  send  sensing  events  to  the  event  manager.  all  these  sensing  events  tend  to  get  response  from  the  iot  system  as  fast  as  possible.  figure  9:  however,  the  available  computing  resources,  usually  memory  and  cpu,  are  often  limited  in  this  particular  scene.  it  is  particularly  important  to  reasonably  schedule  computing  resources  in  a  resourceconstrained  iot  execution  environment.  the  performance  e.g.,  response  time,  throughout,  event  loss  ratio,  etc  of  the  entire  system  is  directly  determined  by  the  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithm  of
__label__assetoperationsoptimization choice.  thus,  we  propose  a  dpfrbased  optimization  algorithm  to  solve  the  problem  of  sensing  event  scheduling.  furthermore,  we  consider  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  aspects  for  the  evaluation  of  our  proposed  optimization  algorithm.  multiple  types  of  smart  sensors  are  widely  deployed  in  the  forest,  which  are  in  charge  of  collecting  the  environmental  information  regularly.  the  gathered  raw  data  not  only  has  a  huge  number,  but  also  has  complex  data  formats.  we  take  this  forestprotection  application  as  an  instance,  the  smoke  sensor  collects  data  in  text  format,  the  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor  collects  data  in  image  format,  and  the  tracking  camera  sensor
__label__assetoperationsoptimization collects  data  in  video  format.  in  addition,  different  sensing  events  require  different  response  time.  for  example,  the  smoke  and  fire  events  tend  to  get  a  quicker  response  than  the  temperature  or  humidity  events.  thus,  sensing  events  need  to  be  assigned  corresponding  priorities  according  to  certain  rules.  the  sensing  events  with  higher  priorities  could  be  first  responded  and  allocated  the  computing  resources.  to  better  schedule  sensing  events,  we  encapsulate  them  before  they  are  submitted  to  the  event  manager.  the  formal  format  of  encapsulated  sensing  event  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  then,  each  item  is  interpreted  as  follows:  topic  datatype  content  priority
__label__assetoperationsoptimization timeout  figure  10:  the  first  purpose  of  event  manager  is  to  act  as  the  communication  substrate  supporting  eventbased  interaction  among  the  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications.  this  kind  of  interaction  is  commonly  referred  to  as  publishsubscribe  messaging  networks  .  the  publishsubscribe  messaging  networks  are  frameworks  where  publishers  publish  structured  messages  events  to  an  event  service  agent  event  manager  and  subscribers  express  interest  in  different  events  to  the  event  service  agent  through  lightweight  directory  access  protocol  ldap  topic  tree  which  is  responsible  for  managing  the  event  topics.  e.g.,  the  business  process  in  tracking  camera  sensor  could  subscribe  a  detected  event
__label__assetoperationsoptimization from  the  event  manager,  which  is  published  by  the  business  process  in  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor.  a  main  property  of  the  publishsubscribe  messaging  networks  is  that  they  are  spacedecoupled,  meaning  that  the  publisher  does  not  need  to  know  the  identity  of  the  subscribers.  this  allows  highly  flexible  and  dynamic  architecture.  besides  being  the  basis  of  communication,  event  manager  is  also  the  core  of  event  scheduling.  due  to  the  huge  number  of  sensing  events  and  limited  computing  resources,  usually  cpu  and  memory,  there  is  no  guarantee  that  each  sensing  event  could  be  responded  immediately.  thus,  we  design  a  scheduling  mechanism  based
__label__assetoperationsoptimization on  memory  and  secondary  storage.  when  a  new  event  arrives,  it  first  enters  the  buffer  queue  of  the  secondary  storage.  then,  event  manager  schedules  sensing  events  between  memory  and  secondary  storage  based  on  certain  scheduling  algorithms.  only  the  sensing  events  that  are  in  the  ready  queue  of  the  memory  could  get  the  computing  resource  and  be  responded  immediately.  however,  once  the  waiting  time  exceeds  the  threshold,  the  sensing  event  will  be  abandoned  and  its  corresponding  storage  resources  will  be  released  immediately.  figure  illustrates  the  role  of  event  manager  in  the  event  scheduling.  figure  11:  the  limited  computing  resource  is  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization most  important  resource  in  the  modern  iot  system.  sensing  event  scheduling  is  mainly  to  allocate  computing  resource  to  each  sensing  event  based  on  some  scheduling  algorithms.  the  throughput  and  response  time  of  the  iot  system  are  directly  affected  by  the  selected  scheduling  algorithm.  the  goal  for  sensing  event  scheduling  is  the  final  result  that  needs  to  be  achieved.  in  general,  the  common  goals  are  represented  as  follows:  fairness  low  response  time  high  throughput  there  are  a  variety  of  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms  that  could  be  chosen  in  the  phase  of  design.  in  order  to  allow  users  to  select  the  appropriate
__label__assetoperationsoptimization algorithm  based  on  demand,  we  should  clearly  give  some  evaluation  standards.  turnaround  time  response  time  throughput  loss  tolerance  the  approaches  mentioned  in  the  work  could  be  summarized  as  a  first  come  first  response  fcfr  algorithm  that  schedules  sensing  events  based  on  the  sequence.  the  sensing  event  entering  the  buffer  queue  in  the  secondary  storage  earlier  will  be  first  responded.  the  data  structure  in  the  secondary  storage  is  queue  by  nature.  this  data  structure  has  the  natural  characteristics  of  first  in  first  out.  thus,  fcfr  algorithm  could  be  realized  easily.  however,  this  algorithm  is  conducive  to  the  long  sensing  events,  but
__label__assetoperationsoptimization not  conducive  to  the  short  ones.  the  short  sensing  events  behind  the  long  sensing  events  have  to  wait  a  long  time  for  scheduling,  resulting  in  poor  performances  in  turnaround  time  and  throughput.  furthermore,  fcfr  algorithm  does  not  consider  the  priority  of  the  sensing  event,  which  is  an  important  factor  in  the  iot  environment.  then,  we  consider  an  example  to  quantitatively  analyze  the  performance  of  fcfr  algorithm.  we  suppose  that  there  are  five  different  kinds  of  sensing  events  in  the  buffer  queue  of  the  secondary  storage.  these  sensing  events  have  different  arrival  time,  execution  time,  and  priorities.  the  detailed  information  is
__label__assetoperationsoptimization illustrated  in  table  .  table  2:  we  could  obtain  the  corresponding  sequence  diagram  of  these  sensing  events  based  on  fcfr  algorithm,  which  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  the  final  turnaround  time  and  weighted  turnaround  time  are  depicted  in  table  .  figure  12:  table  3:  the  approaches  mentioned  in  the  work  ,  ,  could  be  summarized  as  a  static  priority  first  response  spfr  algorithm  that  schedules  sensing  events  based  on  the  static  priority.  the  sensing  event  with  higher  priority  will  be  first  responded.  each  sensing  event  is  assigned  an  integer  when  it  enters  the  buffer  queue  in  the  secondary  storage.  this
__label__assetoperationsoptimization integer  could  not  be  changed  during  the  execution  period.  as  mentioned  above,  there  are  a  variety  of  sensing  events  that  tend  to  get  response  from  the  iot  system  as  fast  as  possible.  we  initially  assign  static  priority  according  to  the  urgency  of  the  sensing  event.  we  take  this  collaborative  iotaware  business  process  application  in  the  forestprotection  scene  as  an  instance,  the  firerelated  sensing  events  should  have  higher  priorities  than  the  temperature  or  humidity  sensing  events.  spfr  algorithm  could  ensure  that  the  sensing  event  with  higher  priority  could  be  first  responded.  as  we  know,  prioritybased  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithm  is  often
__label__assetoperationsoptimization nonpreemptive,  meaning  that  even  if  the  lowpriority  sensing  event  enters  the  buffer  queue  earlier  than  the  highpriority  sensing  event,  it  has  to  wait  a  long  time  for  the  execution  of  the  latter  one.  however,  spfr  algorithm  is  conducive  to  the  sensing  event  that  could  be  assigned  a  high  priority  at  the  beginning  of  the  iot  system,  but  not  conducive  to  the  sensing  event  that  is  assigned  a  low  priority.  this  is  not  only  contrary  to  the  principle  of  fairness  but  also  results  in  poor  performances  in  turnaround  time  and  throughput.  then,  we  also  consider  the  example  in  fcfr  algorithm  to
__label__assetoperationsoptimization quantitatively  analyze  the  performance  of  spfr  algorithm.  the  corresponding  sequence  diagram  of  these  sensing  events  based  on  spfr  algorithm  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  the  final  turnaround  time  and  weighted  turnaround  time  for  each  sensing  event  are  depicted  in  table  .  figure  13:  table  4:  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  dynamic  priority  first  response  dpfr  algorithm  that  schedules  sensing  events  based  on  the  dynamic  priority.  the  sensing  event  with  higher  priority  will  be  first  responded.  different  to  spfr  algorithm,  the  priority  could  be  modified  by  the  event  manager  according  to  certain  rules  during  the  execution  period  of  iot  system.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization in  order  to  maximize  fairness  on  the  basis  of  priority,  we  propose  this  dynamic  prioritybased  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithm.  the  core  of  dpfr  algorithm  is  the  principle  to  be  followed  for  priority  modification.  we  should  ensure  that  every  sensing  event  could  obtain  a  reasonable  computing  resource  from  the  iot  system.  thus,  the  concept  of  response  ratio  is  proposed  and  defined  as  follows:  as  we  know,  the  response  time  equals  the  sum  of  waiting  time  and  execution  time.  thus,  equation  could  be  presented  in  the  following  format:  based  on  dpfr  algorithm,  the  event  manager  regularly  calculates  and  modifies  the  values  of
__label__assetoperationsoptimization all  the  sensing  event  priorities.  the  sensing  event  whose  rr  is  largest  will  be  first  responded.  we  could  draw  the  following  conclusions  through  analyzing  equation  .  then,  we  consider  the  example  discussed  earlier  to  quantitatively  analyze  the  performance  of  dpfr  algorithm.  we  assume  that  none  of  the  sensing  events  have  timed  out.  with  algorithm  ,  we  could  get  the  priority  sequence  for  each  scheduling  unit.  at  the  time  3.0,  the  sensing  event  has  been  responded  and  the  sensing  event  has  not  entered  the  buffer  queue.  according  to  dpfr  algorithm,  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  131/61.33,  the  rr  of  sensing
__label__assetoperationsoptimization event  is  132/12,  and  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  1.  thus,  the  sensing  event  should  be  responded.  we  could  calculate  the  rrs  of  the  remaining  sensing  events  at  the  time  4.0  using  the  same  method.  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  141/61.5,  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  143/41.25,  and  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  1.  thus,  the  sensing  event  should  be  responded.  at  the  time  10.0,  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  1103/42.75,  and  the  rr  of  sensing  event  is  1104/24.  thus,  the  sensing  event  should  be  responded.  the  corresponding  sequence  diagram  of  these  sensing  events  based
__label__assetoperationsoptimization on  dpfr  algorithm  is  illustrated  in  figure  .  the  final  turnaround  time  and  weighted  turnaround  time  for  each  sensing  event  are  depicted  in  table  .  algorithm  1:  figure  14:  table  5:  by  comparing  the  results  of  turnaround  time  and  weight  turnaround  time  among  these  three  algorithms,  we  could  find  that  dpfr  algorithm  has  the  better  performance.  to  further  evaluate  our  proposed  optimization  algorithm,  we  conduct  simulation  experiments  on  the  basis  of  larger  data  sets.  the  simulation  experiments  were  conducted  on  a  pc,  which  had  6g  of  ram,  3.07ghz  of  cpus,  and  500g  of  disk  space.  we  allocated  1g  of  ram
__label__assetoperationsoptimization and  2g  of  disk  space  for  the  following  experiments.  to  simulate  the  sensors  to  collect  data  in  the  iot  environment,  we  sent  ten  data  packets  to  the  buffer  queue  in  the  secondary  storage  every  1  millisecond.  in  addition,  we  randomly  specified  the  data  size  and  initial  priority  of  the  data  packet.  the  data  size  ranged  from  1k  to  100k,  and  the  initial  priority  ranged  from  1  to  5.  we  repeatedly  conducted  the  experiments  in  the  condition  that  the  values  of  timeout  were  set  to  5  milliseconds  and  10  milliseconds,  respectively.  the  sampling  time  was  1000  milliseconds,  and  the  final  results
__label__assetoperationsoptimization were  illustrated  as  follows:  throughput  is  the  total  numbers  of  sensing  events  that  have  been  responded  by  the  iot  system  within  a  unit  time.  the  value  of  throughout  is  directly  affected  by  the  average  response  time.  due  to  the  different  scheduling  principles,  the  response  time  of  sensing  events  in  dpfr  algorithm  was  the  shortest.  thus,  it  could  respond  to  more  sensing  events  than  fcfr  and  spfr  algorithms  within  a  unit  time.  figure  illustrated  the  results  of  throughput  based  on  three  different  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms.  in  fcfr  algorithm,  the  sensing  events  at  the  end  of  the  buffer  queue  had  to
__label__assetoperationsoptimization wait  a  long  time  for  scheduling  the  sensing  events  before  them.  similar  to  fcfr  algorithm,  the  sensing  events  with  lowinitial  priority  had  to  wait  a  long  time  for  scheduling  the  highpriority  sensing  events  in  spfr  algorithm.  however,  both  algorithms  considered  only  a  single  factor  and  were  not  conducive  to  the  certain  parts  of  the  sensing  events  in  the  buffer  queue.  thus,  the  waiting  time  and  execution  time  of  these  sensing  events  were  significantly  increased.  different  to  them,  in  our  proposed  dpfr  algorithm,  sensing  events  were  scheduled  based  on  their  rr  values.  according  to  the  definition  of  rr,  we  could  know
__label__assetoperationsoptimization that  the  priority  was  determined  by  the  waiting  time  and  execution  time  together.  if  the  waiting  time  was  the  same,  the  shorter  of  the  execution  time,  the  larger  of  the  rr  value.  if  the  execution  time  was  the  same,  the  longer  of  the  waiting  time,  the  larger  of  the  rr  value.  this  algorithm  took  into  account  both  factors  of  the  sensing  events,  which  ensured  that  each  sensing  event  could  be  responded  as  soon  as  possible.  thus,  the  average  response  time  of  sensing  events  in  dpfr  algorithm  was  shortest  and  the  value  of  throughput  in  dpfr  was  largest.  figure  showed  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization average  response  time  based  on  three  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms.  figure  15:  figure  16:  in  order  to  improve  the  system  utilization,  we  should  try  our  best  to  keep  the  cpu  busy  and  reduce  the  waiting  time.  figure  illustrated  cpu  utilization  of  the  system  with  different  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms.  the  results  showed  that  dpfr  algorithm  performed  better  than  fcfr  and  spfr  algorithms  at  lower  traffic  intensity.  as  cpu  was  considered  to  be  a  limited  resource,  dpfr  algorithm  could  better  adapt  to  the  resourceconstricted  iot  environment.  figure  17:  as  mentioned  above,  timeout  was  set  to  ensure  the  buffer  queue  in  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization secondary  storage  to  be  fully  utilized.  as  the  sampling  time  increased,  the  waiting  time  of  sensing  events,  especially  the  later  arrival  and  lower  initial  priority  sensing  events,  was  significantly  increased,  resulting  in  the  increase  of  abandoned  sensing  events.  figures  and  illustrated  the  amount  of  abandoned  sensing  events  when  the  timeout  was  set  to  10  milliseconds  and  5  milliseconds.  we  could  see  that  the  abandoned  sensing  events  in  dpfr  algorithm  were  less  than  in  fcfr  and  spfr  algorithms.  moreover,  the  curve  increased  more  gently  for  dpfr  algorithm  than  the  other  algorithms  with  increasing  sampling  time.  furthermore,  the  shorter  of  the  timeout
__label__assetoperationsoptimization threshold,  the  more  obvious  of  the  difference  among  these  three  different  algorithms.  figure  18:  figure  19:  fairness  was  used  to  evaluate  whether  the  iot  system  could  reasonably  allocate  limited  resources.  we  should  try  our  best  to  ensure  that  all  kinds  of  sensing  events  could  get  response  form  the  iot  system.  in  order  to  further  compare  the  performances  of  three  sensing  event  scheduling  algorithms,  we  defined  that  the  sensing  events,  whose  data  size  were  larger  than  50k,  as  long  events  and  the  rest  as  short  events.  in  addition,  we  defined  that  the  sensing  events,  whose  initial  priority  were  larger  than  2,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization as  highpriority  events  and  the  rest  as  lowpriority  events.  figure  illustrated  the  number  of  iot  system  responses  to  various  sensing  events  based  on  different  scheduling  algorithms.  we  could  see  that  the  number  of  responded  long  events  was  much  larger  than  short  events  in  the  fcfr  algorithm.  similarly,  the  number  of  responded  highinitial  priority  events  was  much  larger  than  lowinitial  priority  events  in  the  spfr  algorithm.  on  the  contrary,  the  number  of  all  kinds  of  sensing  events  that  get  response  from  the  iot  system  was  approximately  the  same  in  our  proposed  dpfr  algorithm,  ensuring  that  all  sensing  events  could  obtain  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization reasonable  computing  resources.  thus,  dpfr  algorithm  could  better  reflect  the  fairness  of  iot  system.  figure  20:  in  order  to  automate  the  approach  presented  in  this  paper,  we  developed  an  actual  development  system  for  developers  to  manage  the  full  lifecycle  of  the  collaborative  iotaware  business  process  applications.  figure  illustrates  the  comprehensive  gui  of  the  system.  it  consists  of  5  major  parts  and  provides  all  essential  tools  for  developers.  each  part  is  responsible  for  a  different  function.  part  1  is  a  basic  graphic  element  library,  which  provides  developers  draggable  process  elements.  part  2  is  a  workspace  panel  where  developers  could  model  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization specific  business  processes,  create  the  corresponding  petri  net  models,  and  bind  the  sensing  events  to  send  or  receive  tasks.  part  3  is  a  configuration  panel  where  developers  configure  the  properties  of  process  elements,  including  sensing  event  topic,  timeout  value,  and  the  types  of  interfaces  by  which  they  would  like  to  access  the  raw  data.  part  4  is  a  menu  bar  where  developers  could  decouple  the  business  processes  into  finegrained  process  fragments,  package  the  iot  application  into  a  war  file,  and  deploy  process  fragments  to  distributed  servers  with  custom  buttons.  part  5  is  a  package  explorer  where  developers  could  open  or
__label__assetoperationsoptimization browse  the  element  hierarchy  of  the  collaborative  iotaware  business  process  applications.  more  information  about  our  work  could  be  found  at  this  youtube  video.  figure  21:  figure  illustrates  the  screenshots  of  our  proposed  system  to  manage  and  monitor  the  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications.  figure  shows  the  collaborative  business  processes,  where  developers  could  graphically  add  or  remove  process  elements,  dynamically  define  the  process  interaction  interfaces,  and  logically  validate  the  logic  errors  of  process  model  a  demonstrative  video  could  be  found  at  this  video.  figure  shows  the  way  to  package  a  designed  iotaware  business  process  application.  developers  could  package  the  application
__label__assetoperationsoptimization into  a  war  file  through  this  step.  similarly,  figure  shows  the  way  to  deploy  a  packaged  war  file  to  distributed  servers.  it  is  worth  noting  that  unavailable  servers  have  been  automatically  filtered  off  by  the  system.  namely,  developers  only  need  to  choose  the  war  file  which  they  want  to  deploy.  figure  shows  the  way  to  monitor  the  information  of  a  deployed  iot  application,  including  the  name,  created  time,  and  execution  status.  figure  22:  in  this  paper,  we  have  presented  a  novel  modeling  and  optimization  approach  for  the  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications,  making  it  fit  in  the  dynamic  iot
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sensing  environment.  in  order  to  reach  this  goal,  we  initial  extend  the  traditional  petri  nets  with  sensing  event  factor.  based  on  a  real  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  application  in  the  forestprotection  scenario,  the  formal  modeling  specification  of  senor  nodes  is  investigated  and  their  coordination  patterns  are  formally  defined.  then  we  could  easily  deduce  its  corresponding  sequence  diagram  from  the  extended  petri  net  model.  next,  we  propose  a  dpfrbased  optimization  algorithm  to  solve  the  problem  of  sensing  event  scheduling.  moreover,  we  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  analyze  each  algorithm  and  conduct  a  series  simulation  experiment  to  compare  different  algorithms.  finally,  the  approach
__label__assetoperationsoptimization presented  in  this  paper  has  been  validated  to  be  valid  and  implemented  through  an  actual  system.  however,  our  work  is  still  in  its  infancy  and  requires  more  actual  applications  to  prove  its  applicability.  thus,  we  plan  to  leverage  our  proposed  approach  to  implement  advanced  collaborative  business  process  towards  iot  applications  in  a  larger  and  more  complicated  iot  sensing  environment.  the  authors  declare  that  they  have  no  conflicts  of  interest.  this  work  has  been  supported  by  national  natural  science  foundation  of  china  grant  nos.  61501048,  u1536111,  and  u1536112,  beijing  natural  science  foundation  grant  no.  4182042,  and  fundamental  research  funds  for  the

__label__assetoperationsoptimization of  things  iot  is  an  important  part  of  the  next  generation  of  information.  wireless  sensor  networks  are  composed  of  independent  distributed  smart  sensor  nodes  and  gateways.  these  discrete  sensors  constantly  gather  external  physical  information,  such  as  temperature,  sound,  and  vibration.  owing  to  the  diversity  of  sensor  devices  and  the  complexity  of  the  sensor  sensing  environment,  the  direct  modeling  of  an  iotaware  business  process  application  is  particularly  difficult.  in  addition,  how  to  effectively  deploy  those  designed  applications  to  discrete  servers  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks  is  also  a  pressing  problem.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  a  resourceoriented  modeling  approach  and  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization dynamic  consistent  hashing  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  to  solve  the  above  problems.  initially,  we  extended  the  graphic  and  machinereadable  model  of  business  process  model  notation  bpmn  2.0  specification,  making  it  able  to  support  the  direct  modeling  of  an  iotaware  business  process  application.  furthermore,  we  proposed  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  to  solve  the  problem  of  dynamic  load  balancing  and  access  efficiency  in  the  distributed  execution  environment.  finally,  we  designed  an  actual  extended  bpmn  plugin  in  eclipse.  the  approach  presented  in  this  paper  has  been  validated  to  be  effective.  the  internet  of  things  iot  connects  everything  to  the  internet  through  numerous  information  sensing
__label__assetoperationsoptimization devices  to  realize  intelligent  identification  and  management.  various  smart  sensors  are  the  fundamental  building  blocks  for  the  creation  of  an  iotaware  business  process  application  ,  .  a  business  process  management  bpm  system  not  only  helps  to  improve  the  efficiency  of  collaboration  among  crosssensor  business  processes,  but  also  helps  to  invoke  appropriate  treatment  measures  before  emergencies  snowball  into  disasters  e.g.,  fire  hazard,  traffic  jam,  network  failure,  etc.  ,  .  because  of  the  diversity  of  sensors  and  differences  in  their  functions,  the  direct  modeling  of  an  iotaware  business  process  application  is  particularly  difficult  .  developers  might  need  to  spend  a  lot  of
__label__assetoperationsoptimization energy  on  coding,  resulting  in  ignoring  the  orchestration  of  business  logic  .  as  we  know,  the  basis  of  an  iot  application  before  any  business  process  automation  is  the  creation  of  a  business  process  model  .  a  model  is  composed  of  all  kinds  of  business  process  tasks,  which  correspond  to  special  function  units  implemented  by  services.  a  bpm  system  would  benefit  from  directing  modeling  if  typical  sensor  devices  could  take  over  responsibility  as  sensor  resources  for  individual  business  process  tasks  ,  .  furthermore,  for  a  largescale  modern  iot  application,  numerous  smart  sensors  are  discretely  deployed  in  multiple  monitoring  areas  in  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization distributed  sensor  networks  .  these  smart  sensors  not  only  generate  massive  sensing  data,  but  also  hope  to  get  a  response  from  the  servers  as  soon  as  possible.  thus,  the  distributed  storage  is  considered  reasonable  as  a  result  of  measuring  the  efficiency,  security,  and  robustness.  then,  how  to  deploy  the  designed  iotaware  business  process  applications  to  distributed  servers  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks  is  a  pressing  issue.  in  order  to  build  our  work  on  a  scientific  foundation,  we  have  investigated  most  of  the  existing  business  process  approaches  business  process  model  notation  bpmn  1.0,  business  process  execution  language  bpel,  and  jboss  process
__label__assetoperationsoptimization definition  language  jpdl.  however,  none  of  the  existing  modeling  languages  could  meet  our  needs  to  directly  model  a  sensoraware  business  process  application.  compared  with  other  modeling  languages,  the  biggest  advantage  of  bpmn  2.0  is  that  it  could  define  the  execution  semantics  and  format  of  the  specification  and  use  the  standard  primitives  to  describe  the  business  process,  ensuring  that  the  same  process  gets  the  same  execution  results  in  different  process  engines.  besides,  our  development  work  is  based  on  an  open  source  project  java  business  process  management  jbpm  6.1.0,  which  provides  various  capabilities  that  simplify  and  externalize  business  logic  into  reusable  process
__label__assetoperationsoptimization resources  and  follows  the  bpmn  2.0  specification.  thus,  bpmn  2.0  serves  as  the  basis  for  the  mapping  work  of  business  process  resources  from  an  iot  domain  to  a  standard  process  task  in  this  paper.  although  it  could  provide  theoretical  support  for  the  modeling  and  some  strategies  are  proposed  to  solve  the  problem  of  efficient  deploying,  challenges  still  remain  to  be  solved  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  .  first  of  all,  the  role  of  sensor  devices  as  a  resource  type  of  the  business  process  could  not  be  directly  represented  in  bpmn  2.0  specification,  which  means
__label__assetoperationsoptimization that  sensor  devices  could  not  be  considered  as  potential  executive  parties  in  the  automatic  resolution  phase.  furthermore,  because  of  the  discrete  distribution  and  complex  sensing  environment,  an  efficient  deploying  algorithm  considering  both  load  balancing  and  access  efficiency  is  urgently  needed.  however,  to  our  best  knowledge,  most  of  the  current  work  pays  little  attention  to  this  problem.  finally,  the  development  process  for  developers  is  still  a  complicated  and  timeconsuming  issue.  they  need  not  only  to  focus  on  the  mapping  of  entity  resources  and  the  orchestration  of  business  logic  of  an  iotaware  business  process  application,  but  also  to  have  an  excellent  programming
__label__assetoperationsoptimization skill.  the  main  contributions  of  our  work  in  this  paper  include  the  following:  we  extend  the  graphic  model  and  machinereadable  model  consisting  of  the  xml  schema  definition  xsd  specification  of  bpmn  2.0,  which  could  formally  describe  the  elements  in  an  extended  xml  document,  making  it  able  to  support  the  direct  modeling  of  a  sensor  device.  we  propose  a  novel  deploying  algorithm  based  on  dynamic  consistent  hashing  dch  to  solve  the  problem  of  dynamic  load  balancing  and  access  efficiency  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks.  on  this  basis,  the  overall  performance  has  been  significantly  improved.  we  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  analyze  the  proposed
__label__assetoperationsoptimization approach.  in  addition,  the  work  presented  in  this  paper  has  been  implemented  through  an  actual  development  system.  the  rest  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  we  discuss  the  related  works  and  clearly  point  out  the  similarities  and  differences  in  .  in  ,  the  formal  modeling  specifications  of  a  smart  sensor  device,  including  both  graphic  and  machinereadable  models,  are  investigated.  we  propose  a  novel  deploying  algorithm  to  solve  the  problem  of  load  balancing  and  access  efficiency  in  .  in  ,  we  discuss  the  feasibility  of  our  proposed  approach  and  evaluate  it  through  a  series  of  simulation  experiments.  on  the  basis

__label__assetoperationsoptimization speaking,  the  proposed  algorithm  divides  mobile  devices  into  a  number  of  device  clusters  according  to  the  geographical  location  of  mobile  devices  and  then  deploys  service  instances  onto  the  edge  cloud  servers  nearest  to  the  centers  of  device  clusters.  hwang  et  al.  developed  a  performance  model,  which  defines  manufacturing  processes  and  performance  indicator  formulas.  the  abovementioned  approaches  are  generally  still  in  their  infancies.  the  integrating  model  in  the  work  of  is  humanoriented  and  the  modeling  is  complicated  because  of  the  lack  of  theoretical  support  for  direct  mapping  from  physical  sensor  entities  to  standard  business  process  resource  tasks.  the  merging  operator  in
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  work  of  relies  on  a  mapping  between  the  changeless  nodes  of  input  models,  which  could  not  adapt  to  the  dynamic  iot  execution  environment.  although  the  work  of  proposed  an  approach  to  cooperate  with  end  users,  it  lacks  of  a  clear  understanding  of  what  distinguishes  these  techniques,  and  how  they  address  real  world  use  cases  has  not  yet  been  established.  the  work  of  should  take  into  account  more  business  and  application  driven  research  questions  and  analyze  the  applicability  of  elastic  processes  in  different  application  domains.  although  the  work  of  also  extended  bpmn  2.0  standard  at  the  level  of  a  metamodel,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization this  extension  was  based  on  the  lane.  in  contrast  to  these  works,  we  extended  the  standard  at  the  level  of  activity,  which  could  directly  inherit  the  associations  of  resourcerole.  besides,  we  decoupled  the  internal  connection  between  sensor  devices  through  a  special  class,  which  supports  the  dynamic  assignment  of  entity  resources.  the  work  of  requires  more  complex  indirect  mappings  that  are  needed  when  sensorassociated  elements  are  used.  the  work  of  ignores  the  load  balancing  of  distributed  servers  and  the  access  efficiency  of  deployed  iotaware  business  process  applications.  however,  the  computation  complexity  of  heal  in  the  work  of  is  ov  ;  they
__label__assetoperationsoptimization should  reduce  the  time  complexity  and  investigate  the  interaction  between  heal  and  the  network  layer.  the  hierarchical  strategy  in  the  work  of  is  used  to  adjust  the  distance  between  the  parent  node  and  the  child  node  to  reduce  node  movement.  however,  the  energy  consumption  of  ctda  is  less  than  that  of  connected  dominating  set  cda,  particularly  in  a  distributed  environment.  similar  to  the  work  of  ,  we  also  built  our  work  on  the  basis  of  a  hashing  algorithm.  however,  the  number  to  conduct  the  hash  operation  in  this  approach  relies  on  servers,  which  could  not  adapt  to  the  dynamic  execution
__label__assetoperationsoptimization environment.  the  work  of  focused  only  on  network  latency  for  reducing  the  response  time.  a  service  consists  of  computation,  communication,  and  i/o.  thus,  they  should  take  these  factors  into  account  for  designing  an  advanced  service  deployment.  the  automation  in  the  work  of  is  limited.  in  order  to  develop  and  manage  an  iot  application,  users  have  to  do  large  amounts  of  coding  work,  including  the  configuring  of  parameters,  compiling  of  xml  files,  and  validating  of  the  model.  this  not  only  takes  lots  of  time  and  energy,  but  also  easily  leads  to  ignoring  the  orchestration  of  business  logic.  besides  the  theoretical  methods,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization in  order  to  automate  the  approach  presented  in  this  paper,  we  have  developed  an  actual  system  for  developers  to  manage  the  full  lifecycle  of  the  iotaware  business  process  applications.  our  work  is  based  on  an  open  source  project  jbpm  6.1.0  ,  which  is  an  eclipsebased  editor  to  support  the  graphical  creation  of  business  processes.  however,  the  existing  functions  could  not  meet  our  needs  to  directly  model  and  efficiently  deploy  business  process  applications.  therefore,  we  extended  them  and  developed  a  series  of  custom  buttons.  in  this  section,  we  will  propose  a  new  resourceoriented  modeling  specification  as  an  extension  to  bpmn  2.0
__label__assetoperationsoptimization specification.  when  integrating  the  paradigm  of  a  sensor  device  on  the  business  process  layer,  we  faced  two  main  challenges.  first,  the  role  of  sensor  devices  as  a  business  process  resource  could  not  be  directly  represented  in  the  basic  element  library.  second,  it  could  not  directly  parse  the  sensor  associated  service  in  the  process  execution  engine,  which  is  not  known  in  xml  format  to  the  bpm  environment.  however,  the  existing  bpmn  2.0  specification  could  not  fully  consider  these  two  above  issues  on  different  levels  concurrently  in  the  same  business  process  model.  thus,  we  extended  both  the  graphic  model  and  the  machinereadable
__label__assetoperationsoptimization model.  we  briefly  introduced  this  part  of  work  and  published  it  at  the  20th  international  conference  on  model  driven  engineering  languages  and  systems  models  .  however,  because  of  the  limitation  of  paper  length  and  work  schedule,  we  only  analyzed  the  feasibility  in  theory,  lacking  implementation  details.  to  make  it  easier  for  readers  to  understand  the  advancements  of  our  work,  we  have  clearly  refined  them,  including  the  popular  interface  technologies  to  access  the  iot  service,  the  common  data  format  to  encapsulate  heterogeneous  sensor  data,  and  the  operation  to  specify  the  operation  control  flow  or  message  flow  that  will  be  invoked  by
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  sensor  task.  in  addition,  we  integrated  two  classes  into  one  class  handler  to  optimize  code  structure  and  improve  execution  efficiency.  in  order  to  directly  model  a  sensor  as  a  business  process  resource  in  the  basic  element  library,  we  need  to  consider  the  following  three  aspects:  sensor  device  ,  sensor  service  ,  and  handler  .  sensor  device  determines  the  entity  type  of  a  sensor.  for  example,  it  is  either  a  temperature  sensor,  a  light  sensor,  or  a  pressure  sensor.  in  general,  the  essential  function  of  a  sensor  is  to  perceive  its  surrounding  environment  and  send  data  to  the  information  center.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sensor  service  defines  the  function  that  could  be  provided  by  a  specific  sensor.  however,  the  service  is  not  directly  visible  as  a  part  of  the  business  process  model,  but  is  included  in  the  implementation  and  operations,  which  could  be  implemented  in  handler  .  implementation  specifies  the  technology  that  is  used  to  access  the  service.  valid  values  are  undefined  for  leaving  implementation  technology  open,  restful  for  the  restful  technology,  or  an  uniform  resource  identifier  url  identification.  restful  is  the  default  technology.  operation  specifies  the  operation  that  will  be  invoked  by  the  sensor.  in  bpmn  2.0  specification,  activity  is  work  that  is
__label__assetoperationsoptimization performed  within  a  business  process  and  could  directly  inherit  the  associations  of  resourcerole  ,  which  inherits  the  attributes  of  baseelement  .  an  activity  class  is  an  abstract  element,  which  represents  the  point  in  a  process  flow  where  work  could  be  performed.  in  order  to  explicitly  distinguish  sensor  devices  from  the  traditional  business  process  performers  and  bind  sensor  services  to  the  graphical  element  through  an  interface  component,  we  design  a  characteristic  icon,  called  sensor  task  ,  at  the  level  of  activity  .  the  designed  task  sensor  task  shares  the  same  shape  as  the  common  task,  which  is  a  rectangle  that  has
__label__assetoperationsoptimization rounded  corners.  however,  there  is  a  graphical  sensor  in  the  upper  left  corner  of  the  shape  that  indicates  that  the  task  is  a  sensor  task  .  we  provide  the  interfaces  implementation  and  operation  in  attributes  for  developers  to  bind  services  and  define  the  parameters  of  a  specific  sensor.  in  order  to  illustrate  the  use  of  the  graphical  model,  illustrates  a  business  process  model  of  the  temperature  perception  associated  application.  the  left  of  shows  the  basic  element  library,  where  developers  create  this  business  process  model  through  dragging  and  dropping  the  corresponding  process  tasks.  the  middle  of  shows  the  designed  business  process
__label__assetoperationsoptimization model,  which  contains  a  regular  line  and  an  iotaware  sensor  line,  namely  sensor  device  ,  that  could  expose  its  service  through  a  restful  interface.  the  right  of  illustrates  the  configuration  of  relevant  parameters,  including  sensor  name,  version,  input/output  data  type,  access  priority,  and  storage  path.  a  business  process  model  of  the  temperature  perception  associated  application.  based  on  the  extension  of  the  graphic  model,  we  could  directly  create  a  sensoraware  business  process  through  dragging  and  dropping  the  corresponding  icons  from  the  element  library.  however,  there  is  another  problem  to  be  solved.  that  is,  although  bpmn  2.0  specification  already  supports  the  allocation
__label__assetoperationsoptimization of  resources  at  the  activity  level  ,  ,  it  could  not  directly  parse  the  sensor  associated  service  in  the  business  process  execution  engine,  which  is  not  known  in  xml  format  in  the  bpm  environment.  thus,  we  also  extend  the  machinereadable  model.  to  address  the  above  issue,  we  initially  introduced  a  subclass  to  the  activity  class  and  directly  brought  the  resource  allocation  of  entity  devices  to  the  activity  level.  this  class  is  sensor  device  and  inherits  the  model  associations  and  attributes  of  the  activity  class.  by  configuring  the  relevant  parameters,  the  sensor  information  will  be  passed  to  the  process  execution  phase
__label__assetoperationsoptimization in  a  generated  xml  document.  in  this  case,  an  available  iot  device  class  could  be  found  by  the  process  execution  engine  at  runtime.  however,  the  definition  of  a  sensor  device  class  is  abstract,  because  it  could  only  define  the  types  of  resources,  without  detailing  how  to  reference  the  entity  resource.  thus,  we  design  an  interface  class  to  implement  the  abstract  class  sensor  device  .  the  interface  class  inherits  the  model  association  and  attributes  of  baseelement  and  leaves  interfaces  for  the  sensor  service  class,  which  will  be  introduced  next.  all  process  elements  contain  ids  within  the  bpmn  xml  schema  definition  xsd
__label__assetoperationsoptimization and  references  to  elements  are  expressed  via  these  ids.  the  xsd  type  is  the  traditional  mechanism  for  referencing  by  ids,  however  it  can  only  reference  an  element  within  the  same  file.  the  bpmn  xsd  supports  referencing  by  id  and  utilizing  qnames.  a  qname  consists  of  two  parts:  an  optional  namespace  prefix  and  a  local  part.  when  used  to  reference  a  bpmn  element,  the  local  part  is  expected  to  be  the  id  of  the  process  element.  presents  the  additional  attributes  and  model  associations  of  the  interface  class  and  the  corresponding  xml  schema  definition  xsd  specification  is  described  in  .  interface  attributes
__label__assetoperationsoptimization and  model  associations.  interface  xml  schema  definition  xsd  specification.  as  we  know,  the  essential  function  of  a  sensor  is  to  perceive  its  surrounding  environment  and  send  data  to  the  information  center.  however,  every  sensor  has  its  specific  function  and  data  format.  for  example,  the  temperature  sensor  gathers  textformat  data,  the  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor  gathers  imageformat  data,  and  the  monitor  sensor  gathers  videoformat  data.  in  order  to  better  parse  them  in  the  process  engine,  we  encapsulate  the  raw  data  in  a  unified  message  format,  which  has  been  introduced  in  our  other  work  .  besides  the  data  format,  how  to  directly
__label__assetoperationsoptimization access  these  sensor  services  in  the  machinereadable  model  is  another  problem.  to  address  this  issue,  we  designed  a  handler  class  consisting  of  implementations  and  operations.  implementation  specifies  the  technology  that  is  used  to  locate  a  sensor  service.  valid  values  are  unspecified  for  leaving  the  implementation  technology  open,  restful  for  the  restful  technology,  or  a  url  identification.  because  of  the  widespread  application  of  restful  technology  in  sensor  networks,  restful  is  the  default  technology.  operation  specifies  the  operation  that  will  be  invoked  by  the  sensor  task.  there  are  two  common  situations:  the  first  situation  is  directly  invoking  a  new  task  in  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization control  flow  and  the  second  one  is  indirectly  invoking  a  new  task  by  sendtask  in  the  message  flow.  consequently,  a  sensor  resource  could  be  defined  and  mapped  from  an  entity  domain  to  a  machinereadable  model,  without  being  known  previously  to  the  bpm  environment.  illustrates  the  extension  of  the  xsd  specification  in  a  machinereadable  model.  the  elements  in  white  areas  are  existing  roles  in  bpmn  2.0  specification.  the  elements  in  gray  areas  sensor  device,  sensor  service,  and  handler  are  new  roles  to  extend  the  functions  of  process  engine.  sensoraware  specific  class  extension  of  the  xml  schema  definition  xsd  specification  of  business
__label__assetoperationsoptimization process  model  notation  bpmn  2.0.  in  the  previous  section,  we  introduced  the  formal  modeling  method  for  the  iotaware  business  process  application  in  heterogeneous  sensor  networks.  as  we  know,  a  complete  lifecycle  of  a  sensoraware  business  process  application  usually  includes  the  following  parts:  modeling,  deploying,  and  running.  from  the  perspective  of  application  execution,  modeling  is  the  design  phase,  where  the  developer  could  create  the  business  processes.  because  of  the  complexity  of  the  execution  environment,  the  business  processes  are  usually  crosssensor  collaborative  processes.  in  order  to  get  the  goal  of  distributed  execution,  we  should  decouple  them  into  finegrained  process  fragments  after  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization design  phase.  however,  these  decoupled  process  fragments  are  the  basis  for  further  deployment.  we  discuss  the  deploying  algorithms  based  on  the  results  during  the  modeling  phase.  for  example,  the  number  of  process  lanes  determines  the  process  fragments  to  be  deployed;  the  process  name  and  designing  time  would  be  used  to  conduct  the  hash  operation;  and  the  access  efficiency  is  directly  affected  by  the  prioritybased  storage  structure,  which  is  just  designed  during  the  modeling  phase.  thus,  modeling  and  deploying  are  two  closely  related  parts  and  are  discussed  together  in  this  paper.  in  a  largescale  modern  iot  scenario,  numerous  servers  are  discretely
__label__assetoperationsoptimization placed  to  store  the  massive  sensor  data  and  applications  developed  by  different  developers  to  balance  the  system  load,  which  is  illustrated  in  .  thus,  besides  the  phase  of  modeling,  how  to  deploy  those  designed  iot  applications  to  discrete  servers  to  ensure  load  balancing  and  access  efficiency,  especially  in  heterogeneous  sensor  networks,  is  another  problem  to  be  solved.  a  distributed  execution  environment.  there  are  two  common  deploying  approaches  to  address  this  issue  ,  ,  ,  .  the  first  one  is  sequencebased  storage.  we  assume  that  there  are  n  available  servers  and  m  designed  applications  in  an  iot  scenario,  where  n  m.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization all  servers  are  assigned  constants  from  1  to  n  at  initialization  time.  when  deploying  applications  to  these  servers,  developers  deploy  them  based  on  a  loop  of  the  assigned  constants  of  the  servers  from  1  to  n.  a  pointer  is  set  to  mark  the  next  available  server.  the  advantage  of  this  sequencebased  approach  is  that  the  logic  and  implementation  operation  are  simple.  however,  the  shortcoming  of  it  is  a  lack  of  flexibility.  if  we  need  to  access  or  modify  a  deployed  application,  we  have  to  go  through  every  application  of  all  the  servers.  the  second  approach  is  hashbased  storage.  similar  to
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  first  sequencebased  one,  all  servers  are  assigned  constants  from  1  to  n  at  initialization  time.  in  contrast,  however,  a  custom  function  hash  is  designed  to  map  the  values  of  the  applications  to  constants.  to  distinguish  these  applications,  we  define  them  by  name  and  timestamp.  because  the  timestamp  is  not  repeated,  the  constants  are  different  after  the  operation  of  hash  name  timestamp  .  we  defined  the  symbol  as  the  operation  to  obtain  a  remainder  in  this  paper.  when  deploying  applications  to  the  servers,  we  initially  calculated  the  remainder  i  of  the  function  hash  name  timestampn  ,  where  i  varies  from
__label__assetoperationsoptimization 0  to  n  1.  then,  we  deployed  the  corresponding  application  to  the  server  whose  remainder  is  i.  through  this  approach,  we  can  immediately  get  the  number  of  the  server  that  stores  the  required  application  when  we  need  to  access  or  modify  a  deployed  application.  illustrates  this  approach.  although  this  approach  is  more  flexible  than  the  first  one,  it  still  has  two  problems  that  cannot  be  ignored:  1  if  a  server  becomes  unavailable,  the  function  must  be  turned  to  hash  name  timestampn  1  ,  which  means  that  a  massive  cache  becomes  invalid  or  numerous  applications  need  to  be  transferred  when  we
__label__assetoperationsoptimization need  to  access  or  modify  a  deployed  application.  similarly,  if  we  add  a  server  into  the  sensor  networks,  the  function  is  turned  to  hash  name  timestampn  1  and  we  are  faced  with  the  same  problem.  2  in  general,  separate  chaining  is  used  to  address  the  hash  collision.  applications  are  stored  on  the  same  server  in  the  form  of  a  linked  list  if  their  remainders  are  the  same  value  after  the  hash  operation.  however,  this  linking  is  based  on  the  sequence.  if  we  need  to  access  or  modify  an  application,  we  have  to  go  through  every  application  on  this  server.  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sequencebased  deploying  approach.  to  address  the  above  problems,  we  proposed  the  dynamic  consistent  hashing  dchbased  deploying  algorithm.  similar  to  the  traditional  hashbased  approach,  we  also  need  a  number  to  conduct  the  hash  operation.  in  contrast,  however,  this  number  is  a  constant  2  instead  of  the  number  of  server.  the  reasons  for  us  choosing  2  as  the  constant  to  conduct  the  hash  circle  are  as  follows:  1  because  it  is  a  world  of  0s  and  1s  in  the  computer,  it  is  easy  to  distribute  and  balance  the  data  with  2  m  is  a  constant  when  partitioning.  2  the  ip  address  of
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  server  is  32  bits  and  we  use  it  to  conduct  the  operation  hash2  ,  thus  we  set  the  value  of  m  to  32.  we  consider  that  there  is  a  virtual  circle  consisting  of  2  nodes,  which  are  assigned  identifiers  from  the  number  0  to  2  1.  we  name  and  illustrate  this  virtual  circle  hash  circle  in  .  the  designed  hash  circle.  as  we  know,  every  server  has  a  unique  ip  address.  thus,  we  initially  conducted  the  operations  hash  the  ip  address  of  servers2  and  mapped  them  to  the  hash  circle  according  to  the  remainders.  in  order  to  better  describe
__label__assetoperationsoptimization this  algorithm,  we  assumed  that  there  were  three  servers  in  total  in  the  heterogeneous  sensor  networks,  and  that  their  remainders  were  0,  8,  and  15  after  the  hash  operation.  illustrates  the  mapping  of  servers  from  ip  address  to  the  hash  circle.  next,  we  conducted  the  same  operations  hash  name  timestamp2  for  seven  discrete  applications  and  mapped  them  to  the  hash  circle  according  to  the  remainders.  then,  we  could  get  the  remainders  as  a  sequence,  12,  9,  4,  10,  7,  5,  17,  after  the  hash  operation.  in  this  way,  we  could  get  the  final  mapping  results  of  servers  and  applications,  which
__label__assetoperationsoptimization are  illustrated  in  .  finally,  we  deployed  every  application  into  the  sever  that  was  first  encountered  in  clockwise  direction  in  the  hash  circle.  according  to  ,  we  could  see  that  node  17  would  be  deployed  to  server  a;  nodes  4,  5,  and  7  would  be  deployed  to  server  b;  and  nodes  9,  10,  and  12  would  be  deployed  to  server  c.  then,  we  could  get  the  final  deploying  location  of  the  12,  9,  4,  10,  7,  5,  17  sequence  as  c,  c,  b,  c,  b,  b,  a.  depicts  the  deploying  result  of  applications  using  our  proposed  dch  algorithm.  besides  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization load  balancing,  access  efficiency  was  another  issue  we  needed  to  consider.  in  the  traditional  hashbased  approach,  separate  chaining  is  used  to  address  the  hash  collision.  applications  are  stored  on  the  same  server  in  the  form  of  a  linked  list  if  their  remainders  are  the  same  value  after  the  hash  operation.  however,  this  linking  is  based  on  the  sequence.  if  we  need  to  access  or  modify  a  target  application,  we  have  to  go  through  every  application  on  this  server.  as  we  know,  iot  applications  that  require  being  responses  in  time  include  some  emergencies,  such  as  traffic  congestion,  power  emergencies,  or  fire
__label__assetoperationsoptimization hazards.  thus,  we  designed  the  prioritybased  storage  to  address  this  issue.  applications  are  linked  based  on  the  value  of  priority.  developers  only  need  to  access  those  applications  whose  priorities  match  the  target  value,  instead  of  going  through  every  application  on  this  linked  list.  generally,  our  proposed  dchbased  algorithm  is  a  kind  of  hashbased  algorithm.  the  values  of  the  ip  address  for  every  server,  as  well  as  the  name  and  timestamps  for  every  application,  are  both  random.  thus,  the  storage  for  resources  in  the  hash  circle  is  balanced  using  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm.  this  storage  structure  significantly  improves  the  access  efficiency
__label__assetoperationsoptimization and  is  illustrated  in  .  in  order  to  access  a  target  resource,  the  following  three  steps  are  necessary:  1  calculate  the  index  based  on  the  key.  2  get  the  corresponding  keyvalue  pair  list  according  to  the  index.  3  find  the  target  resource  by  traversing  the  list  according  to  priority.  thus,  the  theoretical  value  of  time  complexity  is  o  1.  the  mapping  of  servers  to  the  hash  circle.  the  final  mapping  of  servers  and  applications  to  the  hash  circle.  the  deploying  result  of  applications  using  the  dynamic  consistent  hashing  dch  algorithm.  the  prioritybased  storage  structure  in  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm.  as
__label__assetoperationsoptimization mentioned  above,  we  usually  need  to  add  or  remove  a  server  in  an  actual  iot  environment.  generally,  servers  are  discretely  placed  and  located  in  different  local  area  networks  lans.  therefore,  their  ip  addresses  are  usually  discontinuous  and  their  deployed  locations  are  not  adjacent  in  the  hash  circle.  now,  we  analyzed  the  performance  of  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  when  facing  the  changing  of  server  numbers.  we  assumed  that  server  a  becomes  unavailable  for  some  reason.  according  to  our  proposed  algorithm,  the  mappings  of  server  b,  server  c,  and  other  applications  are  unchanged.  thus,  only  one  nodes  deploying  location  of  application  17
__label__assetoperationsoptimization is  changed  from  server  a  to  server  b  and  the  remaining  nodes  deploying  locations  of  applications  12,  9,  4,  10,  7,  5  are  unchanged.  thus,  the  final  deploying  location  sequences  are  c,  c,  b,  c,  b,  b,  b.  illustrates  the  changing  of  deploying  locations  of  applications,  where  the  green  directed  line  points  to  its  new  deploying  location.  because  the  sequencebased  algorithm  is  based  on  a  loop  of  the  assigned  constants  of  the  servers  from  1  to  n,  almost  all  applications  need  to  be  transferred  when  the  number  of  available  servers  changes.  thus,  we  focus  on  comparing  the  latter  two  deploying
__label__assetoperationsoptimization algorithms.  if  we  choose  the  traditional  hashbased  approach,  the  initial  mapping  node  sequences  need  to  be  changed.  we  take  application  17  as  an  example.  according  to  the  operation  rule,  its  remainder  i  173  2,  therefore,  its  initial  deploying  location  is  server  c.  similarly,  we  could  get  the  final  deploying  location  sequence  as  a,  a,  b,  b,  b,  c,  c.  if  server  a  becomes  unavailable,  the  remainder  i  172  1  and  the  deploying  location  is  server  c.  thus,  final  deploying  location  sequence  is  b,  c,  b,  b,  c,  c,  c.  depicts  the  changing  of  deploying  locations  of  applications  using  the  hashbased
__label__assetoperationsoptimization algorithm,  in  which  the  green  directed  lines  point  to  their  new  deploying  locations.  by  comparison,  we  found  that  only  one  applications  deploying  location  was  changed  using  our  proposed  dchbased  algorithm.  however,  almost  half  of  the  applications  deploying  locations  were  changed  using  the  hashbased  algorithm,  which  means  that  a  massive  cache  becomes  invalid  and  numerous  applications  need  to  be  transferred  when  we  need  to  access  or  modify  a  deployed  application  in  an  actual  iot  system  in  the  sensor  networks,  which  is  a  resourceintensive  operation  in  the  iot  sensing  environment.  the  changing  of  deploying  locations  of  applications  using  the  dchbased  algorithm.  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization changing  of  deploying  locations  of  applications  using  the  hashbased  algorithm.  servers  are  usually  discretely  placed  and  located  in  different  lans,  which  means  that  their  ip  addresses  are  usually  discontinuous  and  their  deployed  locations  are  not  adjacent  in  the  hash  circle.  however,  from  the  perspective  of  algorithm  integrity,  we  should  take  into  account  the  special  situation  in  which  the  ip  addresses  of  servers  are  adjacent.  in  this  case,  some  servers  will  be  frequently  visited,  meanwhile  other  servers  are  idle.  to  address  this  issue,  we  designed  virtual  nodes.  a  virtual  node  is  a  replica  of  the  actual  node  in  the  hash  circle.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization we  would  set  two  virtual  nodes  for  an  actual  node  in  our  proposed  dchbased  deploying  algorithm.  the  calculation  of  virtual  node  could  adopt  the  ip  address  of  the  corresponding  node  plus  digital  suffix.  for  example,  we  assumed  that  the  ip  address  of  server  x  was  192.168.1.10.  without  the  virtual  nodes,  the  way  to  calculate  the  hash  value  is  hash192.168.1.10  .  using  the  virtual  nodes,  the  way  to  calculate  the  hash  values  of  x.a  and  x.b  is  hash192.168.1.101  and  hash192.168.1.102  ,  respectively.  algorithm  1  describes  our  proposed  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  in  heterogeneous  sensor  networks.  we  take  the  abovementioned  case  as  an
__label__assetoperationsoptimization instance,  if  the  servers  are  placed  at  the  nodes  15,  16,  and  17,  all  applications  would  be  deployed  to  server  a  based  on  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm.  illustrates  the  final  deploying  results  of  applications.  we  could  see  that  node  15  would  get  the  most  requests  because  of  the  circular  placement  method.  by  introducing  the  virtual  nodes,  the  physical  node  x  would  be  turned  to  two  virtual  nodes  x.a  and  x.b  to  ensure  balance.  the  application  assigned  to  x.a  or  x.b  would  eventually  be  both  deployed  to  node  x.  in  this  way,  the  final  server  nodes  placed  in  the  hash  circle
__label__assetoperationsoptimization are  15.a,  15.b,  16.a,  16.b,  17.a,  and  17.b.  as  we  see  from  the  figure,  the  application  distribution  would  be  more  decentralized.  illustrates  the  deploying  results  of  applications.  the  servers  are  deployed  in  the  adjacent  locations  in  the  hash  circle.  the  deploying  results  of  applications.  hash  ip232  hash  ip1232  hash  ip2232  hash  nametimestamp232  we  have  qualitatively  and  quantitatively  analyzed  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  with  another  two  algorithms  based  on  a  limited  data  set  in  the  above  section.  the  logic  and  operation  of  the  sequencebased  algorithm  is  the  simplest.  all  servers  are  assigned  constants  from  1  to  n  at  the  initialization  time.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization users  deploy  applications  based  on  a  loop  of  the  assigned  constants.  however,  its  shortcoming  is  lack  of  flexibility.  if  we  need  to  access  or  modify  a  deployed  application,  we  have  to  go  through  all  applications  on  the  servers.  ideally,  we  could  query  the  target  applications  at  once  without  any  comparison.  then,  it  is  necessary  to  establish  a  definite  correspondence  f  between  the  storage  location  of  the  application  and  its  keywords.  when  searching,  the  target  value  fkeywords  could  be  found  only  according  to  the  correspondence  relationship.  the  traditional  hashbased  algorithm  is  just  an  algorithm  based  on  this  method.  therefore,  we  would
__label__assetoperationsoptimization choose  these  two  algorithms  for  performance  comparison  in  this  section.  to  further  evaluate  these  algorithms,  we  conducted  a  series  of  simulation  experiments  on  the  basis  of  larger  data  sets.  the  simulation  experiments  were  conducted  on  four  of  the  same  pcs,  which  had  6  gb  of  ram,  3.07  ghz  cpu,  and  500  gb  of  disk  space.  one  pc  we  named  it  a  was  simulated  to  deploy  the  designed  applications  or  access  the  deployed  applications  and  the  other  three  pcs  we  named  them  b,  c,  and  d  were  simulated  as  servers  to  store  these  applications.  we  allocated  1  gb  of  ram  and
__label__assetoperationsoptimization 2  gb  of  disk  space  of  every  pc  for  the  following  experiments.  in  order  to  simulate  the  raw  data  gathered  by  sensors  and  applications  developed  by  users  in  the  iot  execution  environment,  pc  a  sent  ten  data  packets  to  the  unified  message  space  every  1  millisecond.  in  addition,  we  randomly  specified  the  data  size  and  the  corresponding  priority  of  the  data  packet.  the  data  size  ranged  from  10  k  to  500  k  and  the  initial  priority  ranged  from  1  to  5.  to  get  closer  to  reality,  we  designed  a  threshold  timeout.  all  applications  whose  response  time  exceeded  the  threshold  would
__label__assetoperationsoptimization be  abandoned.  we  repeatedly  conducted  the  experiments  under  the  condition  that  the  values  of  timeout  were  set  to  10  ms  and  20  ms.  the  sampling  time  was  1000  ms  and  the  total  number  of  deployed  applications  was  10  thousand.  the  final  results  were  illustrated  as  follows:  response  time  was  the  total  amount  of  time  taken  by  the  iot  system  to  respond  to  a  request  for  execution.  ignoring  transmission  time  for  a  moment,  the  response  time  was  the  sum  of  waiting  time  and  execution  time.  shows  the  average  response  time  based  on  different  deploying  algorithms.  the  average  response  times  of  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sequencebased  algorithm,  the  dchbased  algorithm,  and  the  traditional  hashbased  algorithm  were  12.876  ms,  6.925  ms,  and  10.028  ms,  respectively.  the  response  time  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  46  percent  and  31  percent  less  than  the  other  two  algorithms,  respectively.  in  the  sequencebased  algorithm,  all  applications  were  evenly  deployed  to  three  servers.  when  we  required  access  to  a  deployed  application,  we  had  to  go  through  all  the  deployed  applications  of  the  three  servers.  the  time  complexity  of  this  algorithm  was  o  n  .  in  the  traditional  hashbased  algorithm,  we  could  get  the  determined  server  address  that  stored  the  target  application  according
__label__assetoperationsoptimization to  hash  operation  rule.  however,  we  still  had  to  go  through  all  the  deployed  applications  on  this  server.  in  our  proposed  dchbased  algorithm,  the  priority  was  used  as  the  secondary  index  to  query  the  target  application.  the  datasets  that  needed  to  be  processed  in  this  algorithm  were  only  a  subset  of  the  traditional  hashbased  algorithm.  thus,  the  average  response  time  of  querying  a  deployed  application  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  the  shortest.  throughput  was  the  total  number  of  applications  that  had  been  responded  to  by  the  iot  system  within  a  unit  of  time.  shows  the  final  results  of  throughput  based
__label__assetoperationsoptimization on  different  deploying  algorithms  in  the  heterogeneous  execution  environment.  the  average  throughput  of  the  sequencebased  algorithm,  the  dchbased  algorithm,  and  the  traditional  hashbased  algorithm  was  6976,  9728,  and  8012,  respectively.  the  throughput  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  39  percent  and  21  percent  more  than  the  other  two  algorithms,  respectively.  the  value  of  throughput  was  directly  affected  by  the  average  response  time.  as  mentioned  above,  the  average  response  time  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  the  shortest.  thus,  it  could  respond  to  more  applications  than  the  sequencebased  and  traditional  hashbased  algorithms.  the  average  response  time  based  on  different  deploying  algorithms.  the  throughput
__label__assetoperationsoptimization based  on  different  deploying  algorithms.  to  simulate  the  scene  in  which  a  server  became  unavailable  when  the  status  of  the  iot  system  was  running,  we  shut  down  one  pc  after  it  had  run  for  500  ms.  we  repeatedly  deployed  those  allocated  applications  to  the  remaining  two  servers  according  to  three  different  deploying  algorithms.  by  comparing  the  results  of  the  two  experiments,  we  found  that  the  number  of  applications  transferred  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  the  least.  in  this  case,  only  those  applications  stored  on  the  server  that  was  shut  down  needed  to  be  transferred.  however,  almost  all  applications  stored  on

__label__assetoperationsoptimization busy  and  reduce  the  time  consumption  of  the  i/o  operation.  shows  the  cpu  utilization  of  the  iot  system  with  different  application  deploying  algorithms.  we  intercepted  the  results  of  the  period  from  500  ms  to  540  ms.  the  results  showed  that  the  thrashing  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  the  slightest  compared  with  the  sequencebased  and  the  traditional  hashbased  algorithms  when  a  running  server  suddenly  became  unavailable.  because  the  transferred  dataset  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  only  a  subset  of  the  other  two  algorithms,  it  could  better  adapt  to  the  dynamic  iot  execution  environment.  the  transferred  applications  based  on  different  deploying  algorithms.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  cpu  utilization  of  the  internet  of  things  iot  system  based  on  different  deploying  algorithms.  on  the  basis  of  the  above  work,  we  extended  the  bpmn  plugin  in  eclipse  and  developed  a  series  of  custom  functions  to  achieve  our  goals.  in  this  section,  we  will  describe  the  implementation  in  detail  and  compare  our  deigned  system  with  other  systems.  furthermore,  we  will  discuss  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  our  designed  system  with  a  practical  example.  a  illustrates  our  extended  bpmn  plugin.  it  consists  of  five  major  parts  and  provides  all  essential  tools  for  business  process  developers.  each  part  is  responsible  for
__label__assetoperationsoptimization a  different  function.  as  mentioned  in  ,  we  integrated  the  paradigm  of  sensor  devices  as  a  business  process  resource  that  could  be  directly  represented  in  the  basic  process  element  library.  part  1  illustrates  this  basic  element  library,  which  provides  all  kinds  of  draggable  business  process  elements  e.g.,  tasks,  events,  gateways,  etc..  developers  could  directly  model  a  sensoraware  business  process  application  in  this  way.  as  a  tool  to  model  discrete  iot  systems,  petri  nets  have  been  widely  used  to  model  the  business  process  applications  ,  .  in  another  paper  of  ours  ,  we  have  extended  the  traditional  petri  nets  with  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sensing  factor,  allowing  it  to  support  the  modeling  of  collaborative  business  processes  towards  iot  applications.  using  that  approach,  a  sensor  task  could  be  formally  described  by  a  transition  that  has  one  input  place  and  one  output  place,  representing  the  start  and  end  of  the  sensor  task,  respectively.  besides,  because  of  the  importance  of  sensor  data,  their  corresponding  places  are  added  into  the  extended  petri  nets  model.  part  2  is  a  workspace  panel  where  developers  model  the  specific  business  process,  creating  the  corresponding  extended  petri  nets  and  binding  the  sensing  data  to  the  sensor  task.  as  we  say,  the  business  process
__label__assetoperationsoptimization in  a  crosssensor  application  is  usually  collaborative.  thus,  we  encapsulate  raw  sensor  data  into  a  unified  message  format  and  forward  them  through  a  send/receive  task,  because  sensor  devices  are  the  source  of  data  and  provide  different  kinds  of  services.  b  shows  a  designed  collaborative  business  process.  we  developed  a  configuration  panel  in  part  3  for  developers  to  configure  the  properties  of  the  process  elements,  including  the  interface,  timeout,  and  application  priority.  valid  values  are  unspecified  for  leaving  the  interface  technology  open,  restful  for  the  restful  technology,  or  a  url  identification  and  other  technology  or  coordination  protocol.  because  of  the  widespread
__label__assetoperationsoptimization application  of  restful  technology  in  the  sensor  networks,  restful  is  the  default  technology.  besides  modeling,  how  to  efficiently  deploy  a  designed  application  is  another  pressing  issue.  three  custom  buttons  are  designed  in  part  4  for  developers  to  decouple  the  business  processes  into  finegrained  process  fragments,  package  the  iot  application  into  a  war  file,  and  deploy  the  war  file  to  distributed  servers.  in  order  to  support  a  failuretransparent  execution  of  servers,  our  platform  gathers  the  periodic  heartbeat  to  show  their  liveness.  whenever  a  server  fails  to  send  the  heartbeat  message  after  a  given  timeout,  our  platform  would  mark  it  as  unavailable
__label__assetoperationsoptimization to  avoid  invalid  deploying.  c,d  show  the  way  to  package  and  deploy  applications.  our  proposed  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  is  used  in  this  phase.  part  5  is  a  package  explorer,  using  which  developers  could  edit  the  element  hierarchy  of  the  iotaware  business  process  applications.  as  we  know,  the  status  of  a  business  process  instance  includes  notstarted  ,  running  ,  suspend  ,  and  cancel  .  thus,  we  also  support  to  manage  deployed  applications.  developers  could  start  up  or  suspend  them  by  clicking  on  the  appropriate  buttons  in  the  bottom  of  e,  as  well  as  examine  their  information,  including  id,  name,  created  time,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization and  running  status.  these  are  screenshots  of  our  designed  platform.  an  extended  bpmn  plugin;  modeling  the  business  process  application;  packaging  the  application  into  a  war  file;  deploying  the  war  file  to  discrete  servers;  and  managing  the  deployed  applications.  as  mentioned  above,  our  developed  work  is  based  on  an  open  source  project  jbpm  6.1.0,  which  is  an  eclipsebased  editor  to  support  the  graphical  creation  of  business  process  applications.  besides  this,  activiti  is  also  a  leading  lightweight,  eclipsebased  bpmn  instrument  supporting  business  process  automation  needs.  compared  with  these,  the  differences  and  advantages  of  our  system  are  as  follows:  1  these  two  existing
__label__assetoperationsoptimization instruments  could  not  support  the  direct  modeling  of  sensorassociated  business  process  applications.  when  introducing  sensor  services,  developers  have  to  deal  with  amounts  of  auxiliary  operations.  for  example,  a  special  service  task  is  provided  for  developers  to  access  to  external  services  in  jbpm  6.1.0.  however,  it  only  gives  the  abstract  class  and  requires  developers  to  implement  complex  logic  themselves.  if  using  activiti,  its  execution  engine  could  not  directly  parse  the  sensorassociated  service,  which  is  not  known  in  xml  format  to  the  bpm  environment.  in  contrast  to  these,  we  integrated  sensor  services  into  a  particular  sensor  task  in  our  system.  developers  could
__label__assetoperationsoptimization directly  model  a  machinereadable  sensoraware  business  process  without  any  extra  operations.  2  on  the  basis  of  existing  functions  of  jbpm  6.1.0  and  activiti,  when  deploying  designed  business  process  applications  to  servers,  developers  have  to  manually  enter  complex  deployment  commands  in  the  console,  which  not  only  takes  a  lot  of  time,  but  also  tends  to  introduce  mistakes.  besides,  developers  have  to  personally  specify  the  target  servers  to  be  deployed  for  applications,  lacking  the  consideration  of  load  balancing.  in  our  system,  we  integrated  deployment  commands  and  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm  into  a  custom  button.  developers  could  complete  the  deployment  by  clicking  on
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  appropriate  button.  although  we  have  done  most  of  the  work,  as  far  as  our  present  work  was  concerned,  the  applications  on  invalid  servers  have  to  be  redeployed  to  remaining  servers  again  based  on  the  dchbased  deploying  algorithm.  in  order  to  address  this  disadvantage,  we  considered  that  applications  might  be  automatically  transferred  to  adjacent  available  servers  based  on  some  rules  at  the  lowest  cost,  instead  of  recalculating  by  our  system  in  a  resourcelimited  environment.  thus,  the  optimization  strategy  of  the  application  transferring  approach  will  be  another  research  focus  in  our  future  work.  we  have  developed  an  actual  sensoraware  business  process
__label__assetoperationsoptimization application  using  our  designed  system  to  protect  a  large  area  of  forest  and  applied  it  in  north  china.  the  work  of  forestprotection  used  to  be  done  by  the  way  of  human  mountaineering  in  the  past.  however,  this  way  not  only  costs  a  great  deal  of  resources,  but  also  could  not  deal  with  emergencies  in  time.  using  our  designed  iot  system,  numerous  smart  sensors  are  discretely  deployed  in  multiple  monitoring  areas.  these  smart  sensors  are  in  charge  of  collecting  their  surrounding  information  and  sending  the  corresponding  data  to  the  cloud  for  further  processing  and  analyzing.  because  of  the  heterogeneity  of  sensing
__label__assetoperationsoptimization data,  the  system  would  encapsulate  them  before  they  are  submitted  to  the  unified  messaging  space.  in  general,  this  forestprotection  application  usually  involves  the  following  sensors:  the  fire  sensor,  the  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor,  and  the  tracking  camera  sensor.  illustrates  this  business  process  application  using  our  designed  system.  the  scenario  includes  the  following  steps:  an  actual  sensoraware  business  process  application  using  our  designed  system  the  fire  sensor  collects  its  surrounding  information  and  regularly  sends  these  raw  data  to  the  smart  gateway  for  further  filtering,  classifying,  and  aggregating.  when  an  emergency  occurs  in  the  monitoring  areas,  the  fire  sensor  publishes  a  fire
__label__assetoperationsoptimization event.  distributed  servers  route  this  fire  event  and  publish  a  command  event  to  the  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor,  making  it  detect  whether  there  are  moving  targets  e.g.,  explorers,  campers,  etc..  if  they  are  detected,  the  infrared  thermal  imaging  sensor  publishes  a  detected  event  in  time.  distributed  servers  receive  this  event  and  start  up  the  tracking  camera  sensor.  the  tracking  camera  sensor  keeps  track  of  the  moving  targets,  transmits  the  actual  information,  and  requires  entity  resources  from  the  remote  dispatch  center.  as  we  see,  this  application  involves  three  kinds  of  sensors.  they  have  their  own  functions  and  interact  with  each  other
__label__assetoperationsoptimization to  accomplish  forest  protection.  in  a  traditional  iot  system,  we  have  to  separately  create  a  corresponding  business  process  model  for  a  sensor  device.  as  we  say  in  the  previous  section,  if  introducing  sensor  services,  we  have  to  conduct  many  auxiliary  operations.  in  our  system,  we  could  directly  model  this  sensoraware  business  process  application  at  once.  besides  the  abovementioned  sensor  devices,  there  are  other  types  of  smart  sensors  that  are  also  usually  applied  in  the  forest,  such  as  the  temperature  senor,  the  humidity  sensor,  and  the  carbon  dioxide  sensor.  all  these  sensoraware  business  process  applications  are  deployed  and  stored  on  discrete
__label__assetoperationsoptimization servers.  the  traditional  iot  system  leaves  all  deployment  work  to  developers  and  lacks  appropriate  deploying  strategies.  thus,  some  servers  might  be  required  the  most  while  other  servers  are  idle,  which  could  not  ensure  load  balancing  in  a  resourceconstrained  environment.  in  addition,  we  usually  need  to  dynamically  add  or  remove  servers  in  the  forest  protection  scenario,  which  means  that  a  lot  of  applications  have  to  be  transferred  and  redeployed.  in  contrast  to  the  traditional  iot  system,  our  system  deploys  applications  based  on  the  dchbased  algorithm  to  ensure  load  balancing.  if  the  number  of  servers  change,  only  a  part  of  applications  need
__label__assetoperationsoptimization to  be  redeployed.  furthermore,  we  assign  priority  to  each  application  in  this  scenario.  applications  are  linked  based  on  the  priority  value.  if  we  tend  to  modify  a  deployed  application,  we  only  need  to  access  those  applications  whose  priorities  match  the  target  value,  instead  of  going  through  every  application  on  the  linked  list.  on  this  basis,  the  overall  performance  has  been  significantly  improved.  this  paper  implemented  direct  modeling  for  an  iotaware  business  process  application  and  ensured  loadbalanced  deploying  using  the  dch  based  deploying  algorithm.  to  reach  this  goal,  we  initially  extended  the  graphic  model  and  machinereadable  model  specification  of  bpmn  2.0,

__label__assetoperationsoptimization became  unavailable,  only  those  applications  stored  on  this  server  needed  to  be  transferred  in  the  dchbased  algorithm,  instead  of  redeploying  all  applications  using  the  sequencebased  or  traditional  hashbased  algorithms.  thus,  the  thrashing  in  the  dchbased  algorithm  was  the  slightest  compared  with  the  other  two  algorithms  when  failure  occurred,  and  the  dchbased  algorithm  could  better  adapt  to  the  dynamic  iot  execution  environment.  as  far  as  our  present  work  was  concerned,  the  applications  on  invalid  servers  had  to  be  redeployed  to  remaining  servers  again  based  on  the  designed  deploying  algorithm.  however,  the  optimization  strategy  of  the  application  transferring  approach  will  be  another

__label__assetoperationsoptimization iot  internet  of  things  devices  have  become  increasingly  popular  in  recent  years.  they  are  all  around  us  from  fitness  trackers  on  our  wrists  to  smart  thermostats  in  our  homes  and  adoption  will  only  continue  to  grow  in  the  coming  years.  in  fact,  gartner,  inc.  reported  that  5.5  million  new  things  were  connected  in  2016  alone,  upping  the  total  of  connected  things  worldwide  to  6.4  billion,  a  30  percent  increase  from  2015.  gartner  projects  we  will  reach  20.8  billion  by  2020.  iot  devices  are  continuously  tracking  and  using  data  and  information  about  the  way  we  interact  with  the  physical  world.  with
__label__assetoperationsoptimization this  data,  they  make  our  everyday  lives  easier.  the  business  world  is  taking  notice  of  this  growing  market  and  the  benefits  that  can  be  gained.  companies  have  begun  to  deploy  iot  solutions  into  their  business  operations.  for  example,  ups  uses  iot  sensors  on  its  delivery  trucks  to  collect  data  on  drivers  routes,  delivery  efficiency  and  truck  performance.  disney  world  employs  iot  in  its  wearable  magicband  wristband,  which  not  only  allows  guests  to  get  on  rides  quickly,  but  also  uses  rfid  tags  to  collect  data  and  track  their  activities  in  the  park.  while  this  data  is  useful,  there  is  still  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization disconnect  in  integrating  these  powerful  iot  devices  with  missioncritical  business  processes.  business  process  management  bpm  is  the  key  to  bringing  together  iot  data  and  business  processes  to  unlock  positive  results.  it  has  become  the  leading  technology  in  fast,  enterprisechanging  systems  that  optimize  and  streamline  workflows  for  organizations  across  an  array  of  industries.  lets  start  by  reviewing  the  pros  of  iot  and  bpm.  iot  devices  excel  at  sensing,  alerting,  augmenting  reality  and  generally  interacting  fluidly  with  the  wearer  or  user,  while  bpm  excels  in  system  integration,  data  processing  and  process  logic  areas.  together,  they  fill  each  others  technological  gaps.  bpm  is
__label__assetoperationsoptimization an  extremely  timesensitive  and  responsive  technology  that  allows  timecritical,  dynamic  business  processes  to  be  changed  quickly  and  while  processes  are  still  in  progress.  this  means  that  bpm  systems  can  take  advantage  of  the  realtime  nature  of  data  coming  out  of  and  going  back  into  iot  devices.  its  an  ideal  fit  for  business  applications.  both  systems  can  support  humancentric,  systemcentric  and  hybrid  scenarios.  in  a  humancentric  scenario,  the  bpm  system  factors  in  the  human  element  in  the  business  process,  putting  the  person  in  the  center  of  decisionmaking  and  action.  this  makes  it  a  great  match  for  iot  medical  and  wearable  technology
__label__assetoperationsoptimization advances.  iot  devices  send  collected  data  over  a  cellular  or  wifi  network  to  a  centralized  database.  the  bpm  software  then  monitors  this  database  for  changes.  when  a  change  is  detected,  the  bpm  software  will  start  a  process  to  initiate  an  optimal  response.  when  this  important  change  also  known  as  a  business  moment,  a  disruptive,  sometimes  unpredictable  change  that  occurs  during  short  windows  of  time  within  a  business  ecosystem  is  found,  key  personnel  and  resources  will  be  able  to  quickly  identify  and  make  wellinformed  decisions  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  best  course  of  action.  here  are  three  examples  of  how
__label__assetoperationsoptimization iot  can  take  part  in  business  processes  across  various  industries:  remote  medicine  or  telemedicine  is  a  growing  trend  for  healthcare  providers  worldwide.  the  trend  is  being  fueled  by  the  increasing  amount  of  iot  medical  devices  that  are  being  used  in  the  field.  according  to  a  research  and  markets  study  november  2015,  the  iot  healthcare  market  is  being  driven  by  rising  demands  for  improved  healthcare,  reduced  cost  of  care  and  evolution  of  highspeed  networking  technologies,  and  is  expected  to  grow  from  32.47  billion  in  2015  to  163.24  billion  by  2020.  lets  now  dive  a  little  deeper  into  a  healthcare  case  study
__label__assetoperationsoptimization on  how  a  major  european  hospice  is  transforming  patient  care  by  combining  iot  medical  devices  with  an  intelligent  bpm  solution.  background:  the  hospice  has  been  using  telemedicine  and  cardiac  telemonitoring  devices  for  20  years,  but  its  leadership  sought  a  solution  that  would  allow  their  doctors  to  provide  better  care.  the  hospice  wanted  nontechnical  staff  to  be  able  to  rapidly  build  and  change  forms  on  a  browser  for  their  customers/patients,  as  well  as  manage  all  aspects  around  the  care  of  hospital  patients  and  the  internal  procedures  for  medical  staff.  problems  and  challenges:  although  the  hospice  had  mobile  devices  in  place,  one
__label__assetoperationsoptimization of  the  biggest  challenges  it  faced  was  what  to  do  with  the  data  it  was  collecting.  data  alone  sometimes  too  much  data  was  becoming  too  confusing  to  healthcare  providers,  and  the  information  was  not  intelligently  integrated  with  any  of  its  medical  processes.  the  hospice  also  experienced  the  following  problems  and  challenges:  solution:  by  implementing  and  connecting  iot  medical  devices,  such  as  blood  pressure,  ecg  and  heart  monitors,  glucose  meters  and  insulin  pumps,  doctors  and  medical  stuff  can  now  remotely  assess  and  monitor  a  patients  vital  signs.  the  data  collected  is  instantly  transmitted  to  doctors  in  other  locations.  the  doctors  review

__label__assetoperationsoptimization iot  and  bpm  integrated  technology  is  still  in  its  infancy,  it  will  continue  to  become  more  prevalent  and  complex.  this  means  that  more  integrated  systems  will  be  needed.  as  the  technology  adapts  and  grows,  more  decisionmaking  processes  will  be  added  and  managed  in  these  types  of  systems.  intelligent  solutions  will  be  able  to  learn  from  past  history,  perform  pattern  recognition,  access  millions  of  pages  of  research  and  data,  provide  advice  and  even  perform  actions  independently.  well  start  to  see  more  advanced  applications  across  all  industries.  where  is  the  human  role  in  this  increasingly  systemized  world?  the  beauty  of  iot  and
__label__assetoperationsoptimization bpm  is  that  the  technology  becomes  an  important  factor  for  its  users.  systems  can  guide  and  advise,  and  leave  the  most  difficult  decisions  to  the  experts.  hand  in  hand,  users  and  their  system  will  be  better  equipped  to  provide  easier,  faster  and  more  optimized  service.  the  integration  between  iot  devices  and  bpm  presents  a  viable  solution  with  a  bright  future  one  that  will  connect  people,  things  and  systems  together  as  part  of  businesscritical  processes.  gal  horvitz  is  ceo  of  pnmsoft  ,  a  global  software  company  that  provides  bpm  software  and  solutions.  tags  andrew  c.  trapp,  a  professor  at  the  foisie

__label__assetoperationsoptimization its  no  secret  that  the  internet  of  things  iot  is  poised  to  have  a  big  impact  on  how  organizations  design,  produce  and  sell  products  and  services.  more  and  more,  companies  are  looking  at  how  the  iot  can  be  leveraged  across  their  entire  operation,  from  how  they  identify  new  business  models  and  source  materials,  to  how  they  streamline  production  and  manage  the  customer  experience.  here  are  five  areas  where  the  iot  is  having  the  most  impact  within  industrial  companies.  recent  found  that  45  of  executives  surveyed  identified  iotenabled  manufacturing  as  a  high  or  very  high  priority  for  their  enterprisesdespite  only  21
__label__assetoperationsoptimization of  respondents  being  directly  involved  in  the  manufacturing  sector.  this  seems  logical  given  the  impact  the  iot  can  have  on  almost  any  productoriented  business.  for  example,  when  iotbased  solutions  are  introduced  on  the  factory  floor,  they  can  have  a  dramatic  impact  on  overall  quality  by  helping  manufacturers  detect  substandard  materials  and  ensuring  adherence  to  product  specifications.  for  brands,  the  resulting  higher  level  of  quality  generates  cost  savings  throughout  a  products  life  cycle.  production  optimization  drives  additional  benefits.  for  companies  like  harleydavidson,  with  complex  manufacturing  operations,  investing  in  iotenabled  production  facilities  is  a  relatively  simple  decision  with  tangible  results.  at  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization harleydavidson  manufacturing  plant  in  york,  pennsylvania,  for  example,  every  step  in  production  is  now  tracked  and  recorded  into  a  realtime  performance  management  system.  as  part  of  the  implementation,  harleydavidson  installed  software  and  sensors  that  measure,  record  and  manage  the  performance  of  different  equipment  and  processes.  the  paint  booth,  for  example,  is  monitored  for  heat  and  humidity,  and  software  automatically  adjusts  the  speed  of  fans  when  measurements  deviate  from  acceptable  ranges.  the  system  also  returns  realtime  data  to  employees  and  managers  via  large  screens,  computers  and  smart  devices.  this  information  gives  them  better  visibility  into  what  is  happening  on  the  plant
__label__assetoperationsoptimization floor  and  improves  decision  making  in  the  fastpaced  environment.  the  of  harleydavidsons  efforts  to  optimize  production  have  been  profound.  they  have  reduced  costs  by  7,  improved  employee  productivity  by  2.4  and  increased  net  margin  by  an  impressive  19.  in  the  same  forbes  insights  survey,  64  of  executives  said  that  the  overall  management  of  the  supply  chain  was  a  priority  for  their  company.  for  companies  with  sprawling  logistics  operations,  this  seems  obvious.  amazon,  for  example,  has  experienced  rapid  growth  in  the  past  few  years.  it  currently  over  500  million  stock  keeping  units  skus  up  from  400  million  this  year  and  more
__label__assetoperationsoptimization than  490  fulfillment  centers,  hubs  and  other  locations  around  the  globe,  some  of  which  are  over  1  million  square  feet  in  area.  amazon  employees  used  to  walk  through  these  massive  fulfillment  centers,  scanning  and  picking  products.  but  in  2012,  amazon  acquired  kiva  systems,  which  manufactures  iotenabled  robots  that  are  now  used  to  automate  that  process.  by  improving  warehouse  efficiency,  these  robots  have  cut  operating  expenses  by  20,  saving  an  22  million  every  year  in  each  .  if  the  kiva  robots  were  installed  globally,  at  all  of  amazons  estimated  255  distribution  centers,  it  could  save  the  company  more  than  5  billion
__label__assetoperationsoptimization annually.  amazon  is  not  alone,  and  warehousing  is  not  the  only  application.  solutions  enabled  by  the  iot  can  also  help  streamline  the  costs  of  distribution  and  logistics  in  many  types  of  commercial  and  industrial  enterprises.  in  the  healthcare  industry,  for  ,  the  supply  chain  for  medical  devices  and  implantables  wastes  5  billion  annually  due  to  complexity,  redundancy,  inaccessible  data  and  inadequate  analytics.  a  recent  from  strategy  analytics  suggests  that  iot  capabilities  could  help  slash  medical  supply  chain  costs  by  25  or  more,  saving  the  industry  more  than  1.25  billion  per  year.  the  iot  can  also  improve  asset  tracking  and  management,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization another  area  thats  important  to  executives.  seventyfour  percent  of  respondents  in  the  forbes  insights  survey  said  asset  tracking  and  management  was  a  large  priority  for  their  companies.  for  organizations  with  a  large  inventory  of  assets,  the  iot  can  provide  important  information  about  the  location,  health  and  efficiency  of  equipment.  consider  sullair,  for  instance.  for  more  than  50  years,  the  company  has  manufactured  air  compressors  that  are  used  in  a  wide  variety  of  industrial  applications.  the  companys  remote  monitoring  iot  solutionairlinxis  a  standard  feature  across  sullairs  product  line,  enabling  customers  to  monitor  their  compressors  and  receive  maintenance  alerts  that  help  minimize
__label__assetoperationsoptimization downtime.  downtime  is  costly  in  any  production  environment,  and  the  prevalence  of  air  compressors  in  industrial  settings  makes  reliability  critical.  according  to  jon  hilberg,  sullairs  vice  president  of  commercial  and  industrial  air  systems,  compressor  downtime  in  a  factory  is  one  of  the  most  critical  problems  a  user  can  face.  having  the  ability  to  monitor  the  health  of  that  equipment  and  eliminate  unscheduled  maintenance  is  an  important  way  to  ensure  overall  productivity.  of  course,  asset  management  is  a  need  in  virtually  every  industry  and  business  type.  assets  can  include  everything  from  handheld  devices,  furniture  and  vehicles  to  raw  materials,  parts  and
__label__assetoperationsoptimization large  industrial  equipment.  when  armed  with  near  realtime  data,  including  asset  location,  environment  and  health,  companies  can  optimize  how  assets  are  used  and  deployed  to  help  maximize  return  on  investment.  one  challenge  for  financial  leaders  in  any  business  is  gaining  access  to  metrics  that  can  help  avoid  risk  while  simultaneously  taking  advantage  of  the  opportunities  these  new  insights  present.  perhaps  its  not  surprising  then  that  82  of  executives  in  the  forbes  insights  survey  said  that  finance  was  one  of  the  functions  they  were  prioritizing  most.  the  iot  can  play  an  important  role  in  financial  decision  making  by  providing  realtime  visibility
__label__assetoperationsoptimization that  complements  data  from  enterprise  resource  planning  erp  and  accounting  systems  and  allows  for  a  more  holistic  view  of  the  enterprise.  take  atria  power,  for  instance.  atria  power  is  one  of  indias  largest  independent  power  producers.  through  a  partnership,  it  recently  created  a  forecasting  model  for  its  power  generation  and  distribution  network.  atria  has  multiple  locations  that  use  both  wind  and  solar  technology  sourced  from  several  different  manufacturers.  to  populate  the  forecasting  model,  atria  needed  an  iot  solution  that  would  enable  it  to  capture  and  analyze  information  from  its  equipment,  including  environmental  factors,  such  as  wind  direction  and  cloud  cover,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization despite  variances  between  the  oems  in  how  data  was  stored  and  transmitted.  atria  began  by  collecting  data  from  its  wind  turbines,  which  use  sensors  to  measure  things  like  the  speed  and  angle  of  the  turbines  blades  and  temperature  of  components.  every  90  minutes,  the  iotenabled  solution  sends  details  on  the  equipment  and  environmental  conditions  and  helps  atria  determine  how  much  energy  will  be  produced  over  the  next  24  hours.  with  this  information,  atria  power  can  more  accurately  forecast  how  much  energy  it  can  provide  to  utilities  and  plan  for  the  storage  of  excess  energy  that  can  be  sold  later.  one
__label__assetoperationsoptimization of  the  most  broadly  applicable  manifestations  of  the  iot  is  in  its  potential  to  help  organizations  improve  the  customer  experience  cx.  in  the  forbes  insights  study,  90  of  executives  said  that  potential  improvements  to  cx  was  one  of  the  most  important  opportunities  for  the  iot.  while  this  seems  obvious  in  the  consumer  space,  the  iot  can  also  dramatically  impact  how  customers  procure  and  consume  industrial  equipment.  heavy  equipment  manufacturer  caterpillar,  for  example,  is  transforming  its  business  by  incorporating  the  iot  and  other  digital  technologies.  more  than  10  years  ago,  the  company  began  outfitting  its  equipment  with  sensors  and  embedded  connectivity.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization today,  almost  everything  caterpillar  produces,  from  locomotives  and  industrial  generators  to  construction  and  mining  equipment,  can  measure  and  communicate  critical  data.  as  a  result,  over  560,000  caterpillar  vehicles  now  .  to  help  customers  engage  with  these  new  data  streams,  the  company  has  also  developed  a  suite  of  software,  analytics  tools  and  application  programming  interfaces  apis  that  enable  customers  to  retrieve,  process  and  analyze  their  data.  caterpillars  iotenabled  products  increase  the  value  it  provides  to  its  customers  by  reducing  operating  costs,  increasing  efficiency  and  improving  productivity.  in  some  cases,  these  tools  have  even  led  to  full  autonomy.  caterpillars  autonomous  mining  vehicles,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization which  can  function  for  longer  periods  and  along  more  precise  routes  than  manually  driven  vehicles,  have  helped  increase  mine  productivity  by  over  20.  as  these  examples  show,  the  iot  has  the  potential  to  help  almost  any  company  move  its  business  forward.  whether  its  through  production  optimization,  a  streamlined  supply  chain,  better  asset  tracking  and  management,  improved  financial  decision  making  or  a  better  customer  experience,  the  iot  can,  and  will  continue  to,  improve  the  bottom  line  for  companies  in  nearly  every  vertical.  forbes  insights  is  the  strategic  research  and  thought  leadership  practice  of  forbes  media.  by  leveraging  proprietary  databases  of  seniorlevel
__label__assetoperationsoptimization a  second  potential  view  is  to  look  at  organizations  as  ecosystems  of  people  whereby  the  organizations  borders  and  goals  stretch  beyond  the  causal  dimension  of  people  working  to  achieve  a  goal.  and  a  third  way  of  looking  at  organizations  is  by  seeing  them  as  systems  of  information  networks  as  aiims  john  mancini  does  in  his  mancinis  law  .  these  views  already  show  quite  some  optimization  opportunities:  business  process  optimization  business  processes  are  about  the  steps  and  tasks  to  serve  people  and  achieve  a  goal  ,  workflow  optimization,  organizational  optimization,  collaboration  optimization,  information  management  in  the  optimization  sense,  the  list  goes

__label__assetoperationsoptimization reduced  to  one  part  of  it:  business  process  optimization.  business  process  optimization  is  then  used  as  synonym  of  business  process  management  which  it  is  not  really  ,  which  involves  many  pieces  that  need  to  be  mapped  and  improved.  this  goes  for  all  forms  of  optimization,  whether  they  are  functional,  on  a  business  process  level  and  even  tactical.  in  business  process  transformation  we  need  to  look  at  several  components  as  well.  when  we  add  business  transformation  and  digital  transformation  into  the  equation,  there  are  even  far  more  pieces  to  be  mapped,  enhanced  and  connected  and  more  holistic  bridges  to  be  built,
__label__assetoperationsoptimization including  on  the  business  process  level.  digital  transformation  doesnt  happen  just  like  that.  you  need  a  strategy.  such  a  strategy  de  facto  requires  building  several  bridges.  between  people,  processes,  purpose,  information,  technologies,  functions,  departments,  the  list  goes  on.  when  looking  at  transformation  in  practice,  business  process  management  and  business  process  optimization  are  often  and  in  some  areas  increasingly  seen  as  a  way  to  get  it  done.  after  all,  as  a  discipline,  business  process  management  takes  a  holistic  view  on  the  organization  as  a  series  of  connected  business  processes  that  need  to  be  aligned,  enhanced,  etc.  and  holistic  is  the  way
__label__assetoperationsoptimization to  go  in  digital  transformation  as  well.  and  other  people  in  the  enterprise  ecosystem  thats  a  second  good  argument  to  use  business  process  management  in  a  context  of  transformation  and  optimization,  on  top  of  the  holistic  one.  business  process  optimization  is  the  optimization  of  the  individual  business  processes  within  that  holistic  perspective.  and  this  is  what  corresponds  with  our  optimization  needs.  customers  and  other  stakeholders  dont  see  our  silos  or  divisions,  they  engage  with  our  organizations  in  the  context  of  a  business  process  and  the  outcome  of  that  process  is  what  they  want  to  see.  so,  with  business  process  management
__label__assetoperationsoptimization we  combine  the  views  of  organizations  as  ecosystems  of  people,  as  systems  of  information  networks  and  as  goaloriented  business  processes  with  internal  and  external  customers  in  mind,  on  a  macro  level  and  on  the  level  of  specific  business  processes.  the  only  thing  we  need  to  factor  in  is  the  uncertainty  and  unpredictability,  one  of  the  reasons  you  see  an  increasing  focus  on  ,  agile,  lean  and  scrum  as  well  tackle  in  a  next  article.  lets  take  the  previously  mentioned  mancinis  law.  it  starts  like  this:  organizations  are  systems  of  information  networks.  they  only  operate  effectively  when  there  are  clear  and
__label__assetoperationsoptimization predictable  information  flows  within  and  between  these  networks.  herein  lies  a  first  challenge  in  the  context  of  cases  where  information  flows  are  less  predictable  than  ever.  just  think  about  an  insurance  claims  handling  process  and  all  the  exceptions  and  different  forms  of  information  that  can  enter  in  the  context  of  one  single  insurance  claim.  this  is  where  bpm  and  advanced  case  management  come  in  the  picture.  so,  it  shouldnt  come  as  a  surprise  that  bpm  is  not  just  gaining  a  renewed  interest  in  the  context  of  digital  transformation  but  also  in  the  scope  of  information  management.  more  than  ever,  business
__label__assetoperationsoptimization processes  are  interconnected  and  content/information  are  key  in  an  increasing  number  of  processes.  before  diving  deeper  into  topics  such  as  business  process  optimization,  business  process  management  and  dynamic  or  advanced  case  management  in  the  scope  of  digital  transformation  and  of  information  management,  a  word  on  systems  and  solutions.  this  systems  approach  is  a  classic  phenomenon:  each  time  a  new  way  of  looking  at  organizations  or  at  specific  challenges  arises,  the  systems  follow  soon.  the  need  to  be  more  customercentric  and  manage  customer  relationships  led  to  customer  relationship  management  systems.  the  need  to  manage  enterprise  content  led  to  enterprise  content  management
__label__assetoperationsoptimization systems.  the  idea  of  using  technology  to  automatically  optimize  customer  interactions  led  to  systems.  and  of  course  looking  at  organizations  from  the  business  process  dimensions  led  to  business  process  management  bpm  systems.  it  needs  to  be  said  that  systems,  however,  never  suffice  to  manage  the  complexity  of  any  aspect  of  an  organization.  they  traditionally  tend  to  lead  to  a  rather  isolated  view  whereby  the  focus  goes  to  much  to  the  system  and  not  enough  to  the  holistic  perspective,  views  and  end  goals  in  which  they  fit.  in  their  attempts  to  manage  complexity,  systems  simplify  complexity,  ultimately  leading  to  new  challenges
__label__assetoperationsoptimization and  new  complexities  as  systems  are  not  designed  to  handle  human  and  organizational  realities,  they  are  designed  to  achieve  an  outcome  within  a  set  of  features  that  has  been  defined  as  being  crucial  for  these  realities.  each  way  of  looking  at  an  organization  comes  with  its  benefits  and  its  limits.  in  an  age  of  digital  transformation  with  phenomena  such  as  disruption,  unpredictability  and  the  development  of  hyperaware  capabilities  for  the  by  definition  uncertain  future,  these  limits  show  even  more,  as  do  the  limits  of  the  systems  we  have  always  used.  while  these  systems  in  practice  prove  important  as  well  see

__label__assetoperationsoptimization manage  all  traffic  situations  more  accurately.  this  proposed  system  is  overcoming  the  flaws  of  previous  traffic  management  systems.  the  system  takes  traffic  density  as  input  from  cameras,  which  is  abstracted  from  a  digital  image  processing  technique  and  sensors  data,  resulting  in  output  as  signals  management.  an  algorithm  is  used  to  predict  traffic  density  to  minimize  traffic  congestion.  besides  this,  rfids  are  also  used  to  prioritize  the  emergency  vehicles  like  ambulances,  fire  brigades,  etc.  by  implementing  rfid  tags  in  such  vehicles.  in  the  case  of  emergency  situations,  such  as  an  explosion  or  burning  of  something,  fire  and  smoke  sensors  are  also

__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  problem  faced  by  smart  cities  in  terms  of  traffic  congestion  issues  can  be  solved  better  using  vanets,  as  there  is  a  network  connectivity  between  the  vehicle  and  the  network  infrastructure.  therefore,  predictable  information  regarding  road  conditions  ahead  and  route  information  can  be  directed  to  the  smart  vehicles  in  transit  and  intelligent  decisions  can  be  made  before  any  problem  occurs.  in  other  ways,  ssla  in  smart  cities  helps  to  reduce  the  problems  of  congestion,  accidents,  crime,  parking  problems  and  population  overhead.  due  to  the  overall  development  of  the  wireless  technology,  their  applications  are  widely  used  and  vehicles  have  been  converted

__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  ambulance  will  get  the  rightofway.  but  the  disadvantage  of  this  is  all  vehicles  will  want  to  start  moving  in  that  open  lane,  which  will  create  even  more  traffic  for  the  ambulance.  in  the  future  advancements  of  traffic  monitoring  signal  tms,  an  ambulance  will  be  able  to  communicate  with  all  base  stations  to  obtain  an  open  lane  to  reach  the  hospital  on  time.  in  this  proposed  methodology,  we  will  provide  solutions  to  congestion,  traffic  clearance  for  emergency  vehicles  and  tracking  of  stolen  vehicles.  and  one  major  plus  point  of  the  system  is  we  have  designed  it  in  automatic  mode  and

__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  three  categories:  magnitude,  risk,  and  time  .  when  gps  technologies  were  opened  up  to  civilian  use  in  1996,  gm  announced  onstar  in  collaboration  with  eds  and  hughes  electronics.  as  originally  introduced,  every  connected  car  would  have  a  digital  communication  module  dcm,  essentially  a  phone  embedded  in  the  vehicle,  responsible  for  communicating  information  wirelessly  to  a  telematics  service  provider  tsp  or  the  automaker  itself.  in  a  breakthrough  we  categorize  as  phase  1,  this  connected  the  car  to  information  and  services  from  the  outside  world  to  enable  a  safer  and  easier  driving  experience.  onstars  success  is  clear  in  terms  of  its
__label__assetoperationsoptimization ability  to  effectively  push  the  right  kinds  of  information  around  the  value  loop.  for  example,  safety  services  leverage  sensors  embedded  in  the  vehicle  aggregating  information  that  the  car  creates  and  communicates  associated  with  safetyrelated  events  and  emergency  situations.  navigation  services  use  gps  technology  to  ascertain  the  autos  location.  analysis  of  the  information  enables  the  provider  to  use  augmentedbehavior  technologies  to  act  on  the  customers  behalffrom  dispatching  emergency  services  to  the  site  of  a  crashed  vehicle  to  providing  live  concierge  services  over  the  invehicle  phone.  the  timeliness,  reliability,  and  accuracy  of  information  are  the  most  critical  value  drivers,  due  to  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization importance  of  rapid  response  in  emergency  situations  and  the  legal  implications  of  safety  failures.  the  automotive  ecosystem  was  becoming  more  than  just  the  car  and  its  maker.  unlike  the  closed  dair  ecosystem,  onstars  ecosystem  brought  in  two  new  players:  the  hardware  providers  and  tier  2  chip  providers  that  supplied  the  dcm  devices  and  the  tsps  that  provided  the  core  services.  the  new  hardware  providers,  operating  similarly  to  existing  tier  1  providers,  fit  within  existing  power  structures.  the  tsps,  however,  represented  an  important  shift:  automakers  introduction  of  embedded  safety  services  expanded  their  business  models  beyond  product  manufacturing  and  retail  into  service
__label__assetoperationsoptimization provision,  touchpoints  across  the  customer  lifecycle,  and  the  ability  to  collect  recurring  revenues.  the  communicate  stage  was  an  important  bottleneck  that  tsps  were  key  to  relieving.  as  a  result,  tsps  possessed  two  critical  pieces  of  value  in  the  partnership:  the  customer  data  related  to  the  services  provided  and  the  actual  interactions  with  customers  themselves.  after  a  century  of  carmakers  unquestioned  industry  dominance,  other  players  were  staking  a  claim  to  ownership  of  the  overall  relationship  with  the  customer.  but  the  potential  power  struggle  had  to  take  a  back  seat  to  the  fundamental  problem  of  consumer  adoption:  notwithstanding  industry  hype,  consumers  were
__label__assetoperationsoptimization slow  to  comprehend  the  new  services  being  offered  and  the  benefits  of  such  connectivity;  the  high  prices  of  these  services  proved  a  particularly  big  speed  bump.  even  just  the  two  data  points  provided  by  dair  and  onstar  illustrate  a  trend:  communicationbased  technologies  often  require  an  expanded  ecosystem  to  function  effectively  and  affordably,  appeal  to  customers,  and  offer  opportunities  to  generate  value.  but  while  enlarging  an  ecosystem  enables  a  given  value  loop  to  create  more  value,  it  poses  additional  challenges  for  the  players  involved  when  it  comes  to  capturing  that  value.  the  continued  evolution  of  the  connected  car  has  played  out
__label__assetoperationsoptimization according  to  these  same  rules.  by  the  mid2000s,  the  nearubiquity  of  mobile  phones  and  the  rapid  rise  of  smartphones  prompted  the  introduction  of  infotainment  applications  within  the  vehicle.  these  applications  were  built  on  a  drivers  broughtin  phone  using  a  phones  cellular  connection  to  stream  data  to  the  vehicle  via  bluetooth  rather  than  embedded  hardware  as  with  dair  or  onstar.  the  connected  capabilities  within  the  car  aimed  to  duplicate  entertainment  and  features  a  driver  could  get  elsewhere  at  home  or  on  their  phone  rather  than  providing  a  wholly  new  stream  of  featuresand  new  kinds  of  value.  even  so,  this  signaled  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization new  phase:  a  shift  from  creating  value  through  technology  to  creating  value  through  information,  and  expansion  of  connectivity  to  better  integrate  with  the  customers  outofvehicle  life.  infotainment  services  introduced  two  new  categories  of  players  to  the  ecosystemsoftware  providers  and  thirdparty  content  and  app  providersand  consequently  set  off  an  important  shift  in  the  power  equation  in  the  industry,  even  as  players  within  these  categories  proliferated  and  the  silicon  valley  giants  began  to  make  their  presence  felt.  blackberrys  qnx,  google,  and  apple  all  released  proprietary  software  platforms  in  an  effort  to  establish  themselves  in  this  market.  as  access  to  content  has  increasingly

__label__assetoperationsoptimization a  partnership,  both  players  are  competing  to  completely  own  the  customer  experience  and  customer  data.  no  surprise  that  automakerswhich  consider  the  customers  their  own  and  want  to  retain  control  over  the  center  stackfind  this  precedent  troubling.  automakers  fear  that,  should  they  lose  control  of  the  customer  to  software  providers,  cars  could  become  commodity  devices  secondary  to  the  software  they  run.  some  carmakers  have  chosen  to  instead  build  or  retain  their  own  proprietary  platforms,  or  to  limit  the  data  they  share  with  their  technology  partners.  others  are  exploring  innovative  ways  to  bridge  this  gap  and  collaborate  with  software  providers.  together  with

__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  connectedcar  ecosystem  and  the  struggles  over  value  capture.  the  last  couple  of  years,  however,  have  seen  the  development  of  a  hybrid  model  that  combines  the  twoand  opens  the  door  to  the  introduction  of  a  host  of  applications  and  opportunities  for  value  capture.  hightech  innovation  from  outside  the  automotive  world  is  bleeding  into  it,  making  the  current  period  one  of  intense  activity  and  excitement,  with  many  new  entrants,  startups,  vc  investments,  and  ma  movements.  it  is  no  surprise,  though,  that  this  is  further  muddying  the  ecosystems  waters.  at  the  heart  of  these  hybrid  solutions  are  multiple  sensors  embedded  not  only

__label__assetoperationsoptimization from  other  sources,  including  thirdparty  content  and  social  media,  and  analyzed  ,  generating  a  response  that  is  then  delivered  through  the  vehicle  or  other  designated  output  device.  this  triangulation  of  data  coming  from  these  myriad  devices  is  where  the  greatest  value  lies:  firstly,  in  making  sense  of  the  data  to  paint  a  complete  picture  of  both  the  customers  behavior  and  the  surrounding  context  to  generate  insights,  and  secondly,  to  even  enable  this  aggregation  in  the  first  place  in  a  way  that  is  interoperable  across  devices  and  provides  a  comprehensive  and  cohesive  customer  experience.  a  platform  that  can  aggregate  and  analyze
__label__assetoperationsoptimization all  this  data  represents  a  complex  undertaking,  as  it  involves  cooperation  and  collaboration  between  multiple  stakeholders  from  multiple  industry  sectors.  the  aggregate  and  analyze  stages  are  the  real  bottlenecks  for  this  phase  of  connectivity,  and  this  is  what  positions  software  providers  at  the  center  of  value  creation  in  this  ecosystem,  since  they,  and  they  alone,  hold  the  wherewithal  to  deliver  such  a  platform.  it  should  be  noted  that  with  great  power  comes  great  responsibility.  the  increasing  scale  and  scope  of  data  from  the  vehicle  and  connected  devices  represents  a  tremendous  revenue  opportunity  for  the  players  that  own  and  control  this
__label__assetoperationsoptimization information,  but  it  raises  the  stakes  for  these  same  players  in  ensuring  that  the  data  remains  secure.  car  hacking  has  grown  as  a  concern  over  the  last  few  years,  with  several  digitalsecurity  studies  revealing  the  dangers  of  vehicle  security  breaches:  protected  personal  information  could  be  stolen;  hackers  could  potentially  even  seize  remote  control  of  a  vehicle,  with  dangerous  consequences.  in  light  of  such  possibilities,  the  players  that  own  and  operate  on  the  data  expose  themselves  to  significant  legal  liability,  an  additional  consideration  that  they  will  have  to  take  into  account  as  they  look  to  establish  their  positions  in  this  space.

__label__assetoperationsoptimization from  becoming  obsolete.  given  the  rate  of  technology  development,  this  can  pose  a  real  challenge.  with  these  challenges  in  mind,  carmakers  are  exploring  new  ways  to  reduce  overall  product  costs,  shorten  time  to  market,  build  in  greater  flexibility,  and  distinguish  their  vehicles  in  an  era  in  which  software  is  fast  becoming  as  key  a  differentiator  as  body  design  and  fuel  economy.  indeed,  several  automakers  have  begun  redesigning  the  productdevelopment  process  by  focusing  on  standard  components  and  technology.  the  ratio  of  standard  components  will  increase,  reducing  the  productdevelopment  process  per  car  for  example,  time  to  market  and  decreasing  production  costs.  automakers

__label__assetoperationsoptimization where  shared  vehicles  operate  autonomously,  rarely  crash,  and  provide  true  multimodal  transport  options.  some  foresee  enormous  benefits  from  this  transformation:  morgan  stanley  expects  full  automation  by  2022,  creating  1.3  trillion  in  value  in  the  united  states  alone.  the  benefits  will  be  accrued  by  businesses  across  a  gamut  of  sectors  even  outside  of  automotive:  cities,  governments,  and  municipalities;  customers  themselves;  and  society  at  large.  selfdriving  cars  require  multiple  connected  technologies  to  work:  gps  technologies  to  support  navigation  and  routing;  sensors  including  radar,  lidar,  highpowered  cameras,  sonar,  and  lasers  that  create  and  communicate  a  continuous,  threedimensional,  omnidirectional  view  of  a  vehicles  surroundings;

__label__assetoperationsoptimization ecosystem  of  other  devices  and  infrastructure,  still  other  capabilities  will  likely  arise,  such  as  smart  traffic  routing  of  selfdriving  vehicles,  aimed  at  improving  roadway  efficiency.  the  scope  of  the  technologies  involved  appears  to  imply,  as  it  has  in  the  past,  an  expansion  of  the  ecosystem  needed  to  enable  this  value  loop  and  a  consequent  further  shift  in  the  balance  of  power  among  the  relevant  players.  however,  the  potential  impacts  on  the  automotive  business  model  in  this  case  indicate  a  more  fundamental  and  widespread  transformation  of  the  industry  itself.  in  one  scenario,  the  power  lies  firmly  with  the  softwareplatform  providers,  and
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  vehicle  is  just  a  conduit  that  acts  on  the  information  it  is  givenand  is  only  as  powerful  as  its  operating  system.  in  this  way,  it  becomes  little  different  than  a  smartphone  or  smart  thermostat,  chosen  less  for  its  own  merits  than  for  its  operating  system  and  its  compatibility  and  interoperability  with  other  connected  devices  that  run  on  the  same  platform.  here,  the  majority  of  value  is  captured  by  players  in  the  ecosystem  that  have  the  ability  to  use  information  generated  by  the  vehicle  and  its  surroundingsbut  none  more  so  than  the  software  providers  that  aggregate  all  of  that  data.
__label__assetoperationsoptimization many  analysts  predict  significant  impacts,  not  all  positive  for  automakers:  barclays  forecasts  that  shared  driverless  cars  entering  the  market  could  cut  total  u.s.  auto  sales  by  40  percent,  meaning  that  automakers  would  need  to  shrink  dramatically  to  survive.  automakers  must  make  very  deliberate  choices  today  about  the  role  they  would  play  and  how  they  would  work  within  this  ecosystem,  if  they  are  to  survive  in  such  a  future.  gm  believes  that  it  has  designers,  engineers,  and  scientists  who  are  working  at  the  cutting  edge,  and  were  confident  gm  will  be  very  successful.  essentially,  this  creates  a  vision  of  oems  not

__label__assetoperationsoptimization data  volume,  and  many  readwrite  operations.  default  value:  3000  symptom:  if  the  value  is  too  small,  the  following  error  may  occur:  sqlstatehy000  2002  connection  timed  out;  suggestion:  increase  the  value  of  this  parameter.  default  value:  1  symptom:  when  autoincrementing  table  locks  are  used  for  loading  data  through  the  insert  select  statement  or  replace  select  statement,  applications  may  encounter  deadlocks  during  the  concurrent  data  import  process.  suggestion:  we  recommend  that  you  change  the  value  of  innodbautoinclockmode  to  2  to  enable  the  use  of  the  lightweight  mutex  lock  only  in  row  mode  for  all  types  of  insert  operations.  this  avoids  autoinc  deadlocks
__label__assetoperationsoptimization while  greatly  improving  the  performance  of  the  insert  select  statement.  note:  if  the  parameter  value  is  set  to  2,  you  must  set  the  format  of  binlog  to  row.  default  value:  3145728  symptom:  the  database  goes  through  a  number  of  different  statuses,  including  checking  query  cache  for  a  query,  waiting  for  query  cache  lock,  and  storing  results  in  the  query  cache.  suggestion:  apsaradb  for  rds  disables  the  query  cache  by  default.  if  the  query  cache  is  enabled  for  your  instance,  you  can  disable  it  when  the  preceding  problem  occurs.  default  value:  60  symptom:  if  the  parameter  value  is  too  small,  the
__label__assetoperationsoptimization client  may  report  an  error  the  last  packet  successfully  received  from  the  server  was  milliseconds  ago  or  the  last  packet  sent  successfully  to  the  server  was  milliseconds  ago.  suggestion:  the  default  value  of  this  parameter  for  apsaradb  for  rds  instances  is  60s.  a  small  value  of  netwritetimeout  may  result  in  frequent  disconnections  when  the  network  condition  is  poor  or  it  takes  a  long  time  for  the  client  to  process  each  block.  in  this  case,  we  recommend  that  you  increase  the  parameter  value.  default  value:  2097152  symptom:  sql  execution  takes  a  longer  time  if  temporary  tables  are  used  when  a  complex
__label__assetoperationsoptimization sql  statement  contains  group  by  and  distinct  clauses  which  cannot  be  optimized  through  an  index.  suggestion:  if  the  application  contains  many  group  by  and  distinct  clauses  and  the  database  has  enough  memory,  you  can  increase  the  values  of  tmptablesize  and  maxheaptablesize  to  improve  query  performance.  default  value:  10737418240  symptom:  if  the  temporary  file  size  exceeds  the  value  of  looserdsmaxtmpdiskspace,  the  following  error  may  occur.  the  table  /home/mysql/dataxxx/tmp/sql2db31  is  full  suggestion:  check  whether  the  sql  statements  resulting  in  additional  temporary  files  can  be  optimized  by  indexing  or  other  means.  if  your  instance  has  enough  space,  you  can  increase  the  value  of
__label__assetoperationsoptimization this  parameter  to  guarantee  normal  execution  of  sql  statements.  default  value:  0  suggestion:  if  you  use  the  tokudb  storage  engine  in  your  apsaradb  for  rds  instance,  we  recommend  that  you  increase  the  value  of  the  parameter  to  improve  the  access  performance  of  the  tokudb  engine  table.  default  value:  0  symptom:  if  the  query  time  exceeds  the  value  of  this  parameter,  the  following  error  may  occur.  error  3006  hy000:  query  execution  was  interrupted,  maxstatementtime  exceeded  suggestion:  to  control  the  sql  execution  time  in  the  database,  enable  this  parameter.  the  unit  is  milliseconds.  default  value:  50000  suggestion:  this  parameter  is  often  used

__label__assetoperationsoptimization cover  various  real  scenarios  and  the  test  purpose  is  to  compare  hitsdb  with  other  time  series  databases  horizontally.  testing  with  timelines  without  real  meanings  can  generate  reliable  test  results  when  the  test  data  and  software  and  hardware  conditions  are  maintained  consistent  for  these  databases.  8  byte  long  integer  time  stamps  and  8  byte  dual  precision  integer  values  are  used.  the  data  sample  is  as  follows:  each  time  before  testing,  the  database  service  is  restarted  to  avoid  impact  of  the  previous  operation  results  on  the  cache.  transactions  per  second  tps  is  the  number  of  data  point  operations  completed  in  a  time
__label__assetoperationsoptimization unit.  each  time  after  a  write  operation,  the  timeline  is  manually  selected  at  random  for  data  query,  and  the  data  write  consistency  is  verified  based  on  the  granularity.  for  a  hitsdb  write  operation,  the  sdk  callback  is  registered,  so  that  the  operation  failure  or  success  is  perceived.  in  addition,  to  avoid  the  impact  of  the  test  data,  data  is  cleared  before  each  test.  the  number  of  timelines  is  verified  on  the  hitsdb  internal  interface/api/tscount  during  each  test.  the  increase  of  the  timeline  number  meets  with  the  expectation.  singlenode  comparison  tests  for  hitsdb  and  other  databases  one  write  request  for  a
__label__assetoperationsoptimization database  may  include  one  or  multiple  data  points.  generally,  the  more  data  points  a  request  contains,  the  higher  is  the  write  performance.  in  the  following  test,  p/r,  points/request,  indicates  the  number  of  data  points  in  a  request.  write  performance  of  a  single  client  under  500  points  per  request  write  performance  of  a  single  client  under  1  million  timelines  client  cpu  usage  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  result  in  the  table  below,  the  write  tps  decreases  when  the  number  of  timelines  increases  on  the  hitsdb.  the  write  tps  is  about  50,000  when  the  number  of  timelines  reaches  1  million  in
__label__assetoperationsoptimization 6xlarge,  which  is  close  to  the  60,000  tps  performance  released  on  alibaba  cloud  official  website.  write  performance  of  dual  clients  under  500  points  per  request  write  performance  of  dual  clients  under  1  million  timelines  client  cpu  usage  write  performance  of  four  clients  under  500  points  per  request  write  performance  of  four  clients  under  1  million  timelines  client  cpu  usage  according  to  the  results  of  these  three  test  groups,  the  write  tps  of  hitsdb  decreases  when  the  number  of  timelines  increases.  in  the  10,000  and  100,000  timeline  number  levels,  the  tps  does  not  change  greatly  with  the  number  of  clients.  in
__label__assetoperationsoptimization the  1000,000  timeline  number  level,  the  tps  increases  when  the  number  of  clients  increases  from  1  to  2,  and  does  not  increase  when  the  number  of  clients  increases  from  2  to  4.  therefore,  it  can  be  considered  that  the  hitsdb  write  tps  peak  is  about  150,000  in  6xlarge  with  1000,000  timelines.  the  data  is  cleared  before  each  test.  the  write  tps  decreases  to  about  50,000  to  60,000  according  to  a  test  when  the  timelines  increase  in  the  environment.  therefore,  150,000  is  a  peak  value.  free  dzone  refcard  published  at  dzone  with  permission  of  opinions  expressed  by  dzone  contributors  are  their
