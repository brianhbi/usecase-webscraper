__label__environmentmonitoring this  project  focused  on  the  use  of  iot  technologies  to  monitor  the  status  of  a  relevant  archaeological  site:  the  mitreo  in  the  basement  of  the  circus  maximus  in  rome.  we  worked  together  with  politecnico  di  milano,  one  of  the  most  important  universities  in  italy,  in  order  to  use  data  gathered  from  specific  sensors  installed  inside  the  mitreo  to  remotely  monitor  co2,  vibrations,  temperature,  and  humidity.  the  mitreo  is  a  sanctuary  discovered  in  the  1930s  in  good  condition  during  structural  work  for  the  teatro  nazionale  dellopera.  probably  built  in  the  second  century  ad,  the  large  building  was  modified  many  times,  and
__label__environmentmonitoring in  the  third  century  ad,  its  ground  floor  became  a  mitreo.  mitreo  at  circus  maximus  in  rome  iot  technologies  used:  project  team:  polimi  is  a  scientifictechnological  university  that  trains  engineers,  architects,  and  industrial  designers.  the  university  has  always  focused  on  the  quality  and  innovation  of  its  teaching  and  research,  developing  a  fruitful  relationship  with  the  business  and  productive  world  by  means  of  experimental  research  and  technological  transfer.politecnico  di  milano  is  one  of  the  most  important  universities  in  italy  and  is  the  italian  top  compsci  university  for  microsoft.  research  has  always  been  linked  to  education  and  is  a  priority  commitment  that
__label__environmentmonitoring has  allowed  politecnico  di  milano  to  achieve  highquality  results  at  an  international  level,  connecting  the  university  to  the  business  world.  research  activity  moreover  constitutes  a  parallel  path  to  that  formed  by  cooperation  and  alliances  with  the  industrial  system.  for  this  specific  project,  the  research  is  related  to  an  important  archaeological  site  in  rome:  the  mitreo  in  the  basement  of  circus  maximus.  even  though  our  main  customer  is  politecnico  di  milano,  its  important  to  mention  that  sovrintendenza  capitolina  and  university  of  trieste  also  are  involved  in  the  project.  in  november,  the  project  was  presented  by  luca  mottola  and  koustabh  dolui  at
__label__environmentmonitoring sacrum  facere  ,  an  important  convention  dedicated  to  archaeologists,  as  shown  in  the  image  at  the  end  of  this  report.  the  main  goal  of  this  project  is  the  remote  monitoring  of  the  current  status  of  the  mitreo,  using  specific  sensors  installed  inside  the  archaeological  site.  these  include  accelerometers  and  co2,  temperature,  and  humidity  sensors,  which  send  data  to  a  field  gateway  and  then  to  the  cloud  architecture,  in  order  to  visualize  data  remotely  using  a  simple  public  website.  website  data  visualization  starting  with  mitreo,  polimi  is  actually  interested  in  the  creation  of  a  reference  architecture  to  be  used  to  collect
__label__environmentmonitoring data  from  different  archaeological  sites,  using  different  kinds  of  specific  sensors  and  gateways,  with  the  same  cloud  reference  architecture  built  for  this  project.  thats  why  they  are  interested  in  understanding  the  iot  services  that  can  be  used  and  combined  for  other  projects  in  the  future.  the  main  challenges  of  this  project  were  to:  first,  we  organized  some  skype  calls  in  order  to  understand  the  aim  and  the  current  status  of  the  project.  basically,  when  we  started  working  on  the  cloud  architecture,  all  the  sensors  had  already  been  selected  by  polimi  and  installed  inside  the  mitreo,  as  shown  in  the  next
__label__environmentmonitoring image.  mitreo  sensors  installation  the  sensors  send  small  data  to  the  field  gateway  with  their  own  frequency  milliseconds,  and  then  the  gateway  takes  care  of  storing  the  data  locally.  the  size  of  these  messages  is  quite  small,  as  you  can  see  in  the  table  below,  so  they  can  be  grouped  together  to  create  a  single  .txt  file  each  30  minutes,  containing  all  the  data  from  all  the  sensors.  this  .txt  file  will  be  parsed  by  the  c  console  application  in  order  to  send  structured  data  to  the  azure  iot  hub.  mitreo  nodes  configuration  based  on  these  considerations,  we  were  able
__label__environmentmonitoring to  estimate  a  monthly  price  for  the  whole  cloud  architecture  before  starting  the  development,  using  the  azure  pricing  calculator.  this  has  been  very  appreciated  by  the  customer  and  it  was  a  key  point  to  go  on  with  the  development  of  the  project.  of  course,  several  other  aspects  have  been  taken  into  account:  the  ease  of  deployment,  the  chance  to  create  a  portable  and  scalable  solution,  and  the  support  and  skills  of  microsoft  during  the  development  of  the  project.  estimated  price  one  of  the  main  challenges  during  the  development  of  the  project  was  the  parsing  of  the  raw  data.  starting  from
__label__environmentmonitoring a  .txt  file  containing  the  data  retrieved  from  all  the  sensors,  we  had  to  separate  them  and  build  the  correct  messages  to  be  sent  to  iot  hub.  of  course,  we  had  to  work  together  with  polimi  to  properly  understand  the  data  and  parse  it  correctly.  the  construction  of  the  message  was  a  key  point  to  get  the  right  data  visualization  in  the  end.  another  big  challenge  was  the  integration  of  the  cloud  architecture  with  the  sensors  and  gateway.  we  had  to  work  close  to  the  customer,  in  different  ways:  several  skype  calls,  facetoface  meetings,  remote  development  and  discussions.  considering  all
__label__environmentmonitoring the  design,  development,  and  test  phases,  we  spent  about  10  complete  days  working  on  it,  so  that  we  were  able  to  coordinate  the  development  of  the  project  and  create  an  endtoend  solution.  inperson  meeting  with  koustabh  and  luca  as  explained  previously,  four  kinds  of  sensors  are  sending  data  to  a  field  gateway  with  the  timings  that  you  can  see  in  the  architecture  diagram  below.  the  gateway  connects  to  azure  iot  hub  in  order  to  send  about  1  kb  every  30  minutes.  mqtt  was  chosen  here  because  it  is  the  most  widely  used  protocol  and  also  convenient  for  the  model  of
__label__environmentmonitoring nodes  of  this  project.  azure  stream  analytics  processes  the  stream  and  routes  telemetry  data  to  the  appropriate  table  of  a  sql  database.  a  web  app  embeds  the  power  bi  reports  needed  for  visualization  by  the  end  users  of  polimi.  mitreo  architecture  diagram  ten  sensors  have  been  used  in  order  to  gather  the  data.  the  type  of  sensors  used  was  dictated  by  archaeologists  and  the  people  in  charge  of  the  restoration  of  the  site.  the  specific  type  of  sensor  is  simply  the  one  libelium  offers  for  the  waspmote  and  includes:  collected  measurements  are  sent  to  a  raspberry  pi  2,  running  raspbian
__label__environmentmonitoring os,  used  as  field  gateway.  the  os  was  chosen  because  the  customer  has  significant  expertise  with  raspbian  but  no  expertise  with  windows  10  iot  core  or  other  operating  systems.  it  performs  some  manipulation  of  the  data  received  from  the  sensors.  for  example,  with  values  gathered  from  nodes  3  and  4  accelerometers  burst  the  fast  fourier  transformation  fft  is  calculated  and  added  to  the  message  that  must  be  sent  to  the  cloud.  a  python  application  on  the  gateway  generates  a  .txt  file  every  30  minutes  containing  collected  readings.  python  turned  out  to  be  the  easiest  way  to  minimize  efforts  for  koustabh
__label__environmentmonitoring and  it  gives  him  the  opportunity  to  replicate  the  system  across  multiple  platforms  in  the  future.  this  file  will  be  used  to  send  data  to  the  iot  hub.  in  the  image  below  you  can  see  a  sample  of  the  .txt  file  with  raw  data  that  has  to  be  parsed  by  the  c  console  application  running  on  the  field  gateway.  raw  data  txt  file  to  be  successful  with  data  sending,  the  .txt  file  has  to  be  parsed  by  a  console  application  running  on  the  field  gateway.  at  this  point  we  had  to  make  a  decision:  the  language  to  develop  the  console
__label__environmentmonitoring application.  iot  hub  sdk  is  available  both  for  python  and  c.  we  discussed  the  best  option  with  the  customer  and  chose  c  for  developing  this  application  because  of  our  technical  skills.  then  we  installed  mono  on  the  rpi  to  run  the  application.  this  application  produces  a  json  array  of  measurements  ready  to  be  sent  to  iot  hub,  containing  all  the  data  from  all  the  sensors,  parsed  from  the  .txt  file.  for  the  last  tests,  we  used  a  huge  .txt  file,  and  we  noticed  some  issues  related  to  the  size  of  the  message  to  be  sent  to  the  iot  hub.  if
__label__environmentmonitoring the  text  file  is  bigger  than  256  kb,  it  has  to  be  split  into  smaller  files.  this  requirement  is  due  to  limitations  on  the  maximum  size  of  a  devicetocloud  batch  in  iot  hub.  parser  structure  for  nodes  3  and  4,  the  development  of  the  parser  was  a  little  more  complex  due  to  the  data  they  send  to  the  field  gateway:  timestamp,  node  id,  battery  level,  axis,  package  number,  and  a  set  of  20  numbers  representing  of  the  fft.  one  single  data  transmission  from  the  same  sensor  for  the  same  axis  is  composed  of  7  packages,  having  timestamp  included  within  70
__label__environmentmonitoring milliseconds.  we  had  to  identify  these  packages  and  create  a  single  row  in  the  table  including  all  the  fft  values  of  the  7  packages  serialized  as  a  json  and  stored  all  together  as  a  string.  as  mentioned  previously,  due  to  connectivity  issues,  in  the  beginning  we  had  to  work  with  a  .txt  file  containing  real  data  retrieved  from  the  sensors.  real  time  is  not  a  requirement  for  this  project,  so  this  simulation  was  very  close  to  the  real  scenario.  in  the  end,  we  decided  to  keep  working  with  a  .txt  file  produced  by  the  field  gateway,  because  it  was  useful
__label__environmentmonitoring for  the  customer  as  a  log  file  and  also  to  keep  using  the  parser  we  developed.  the  rpi  works  as  an  opaque  field  gateway,  so  we  registered  the  c  console  application  as  a  unique  device  for  iot  hub.  it  means  that  it  doesnt  matter  how  many  sensors  we  have  to  connect  to  the  field  gateway,  its  the  gateway  itself  that  performs  all  the  data  manipulation  and  aggregation  and  creates  the  messages  to  be  sent  to  iot  hub.  this  choice  also  was  made  in  order  to  use  the  same  architecture  for  other  archaeological  sites  and  to  set  up  a  scalable  and
__label__environmentmonitoring portable  solution.  azure  iot  hub  allows  registration  of  every  single  device,  providing  them  a  name  and  a  symmetric  key:  this  means  each  device  has  its  own  connection  string.  in  terms  of  security,  if  a  devices  connection  string  gets  compromised,  the  device  management  in  the  azure  portal  allows  the  device  to  be  disconnected  in  order  to  stop  data  transmission.  iot  hub  provides,  out  of  the  box,  an  efficient  solution  to  protect  data  send:  this  feature  has  been  widely  appreciated  by  the  customer,  even  if  at  the  beginning  there  were  no  specific  requirements  about  secure  transmissions.  once  the  data  reaches  azure  iot
__label__environmentmonitoring hub,  it  must  be  both  stored  and  visualized.  after  discussing  with  the  customer,  we  decided  to  create  a  db  with  four  different  tables,  one  for  each  kind  of  sensor.  we  chose  sql  database  in  order  to  use  it  with  direct  query  as  a  dataset  for  power  bi  embedded.  the  azure  stream  analytics  service  is  then  configured  with  one  input  and  four  outputs,  as  you  can  see  in  the  following  image.  azure  stream  analytics  the  query  has  statements  that  route  telemetry  data  to  the  appropriate  table  of  a  sql  database,  all  similar  to  the  one  shown  in  the  image  below.  as
__label__environmentmonitoring you  can  see,  in  the  statement  the  dateadd  function  has  been  used  to  convert  unix  epoch  time  to  a  human  readable  date.  the  remaining  takes  the  data  from  the  stream  and  stores  it  in  the  table  mapped  by  the  accsample  output.  visualization  is  the  final  step  of  this  project.  we  chose  to  embed  a  power  bi  report  into  an  asp.net  web  application  to  explore  the  data.  this  was  the  best  choice  that  allowed  us  to  achieve  two  important  goals  of  the  project:  create  useful  graphs  representing  the  data  that  can  be  personalized  and  managed  directly  by  the  customer,  and  give
__label__environmentmonitoring the  crucial  feature  of  public  access  to  the  data  collected  from  the  sensors.  the  graphs  and  data  to  be  visualized  and  filtered  through  the  web  application  have  been  created  and  improved  in  strict  cooperation  with  the  customer,  in  order  to  better  understand  how  to  create  the  best  views  for  his  needs:  different  tabs  for  different  sensors,  filters,  and  so  on.  one  specific  need,  for  example,  was  the  possibility  to  create  a  filter  by  timestamp  for  each  device.  data  visualization  with  power  bi  embedded  we  were  able  to  develop  a  complete  endtoend  iot  solution  to  retrieve  data  from  an  important  archaeological
__label__environmentmonitoring site  and  monitor  it  remotely.  of  course,  this  has  great  value  for  researchers,  who  can  monitor  the  data  no  matter  where  they  are  located.  moreover,  the  architecture  implemented  is  easily  scalable  and  portable.  the  aim  of  polimi  was  to  learn  how  to  use  these  technologies  and  how  to  adapt  the  solution  to  other  projects,  and  working  together  allowed  us  to  achieve  this  goal.  the  data  visualization  is  very  clear  and  simple,  and  researchers  can  use  it  to  easily  get  insights  about  the  status  of  the  archaeological  site.  now  the  endtoend  solution  to  remotely  monitor  the  mitreo  of  circus  maximus  is
__label__environmentmonitoring up  and  running,  and  the  project  team  has  developed  all  the  skills  necessary  to  create  it.  in  the  next  few  months  the  system  will  be  tested  and  used  by  researchers  in  order  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  solution  and  to  understand  how  to  improve  it,  considering  the  specific  needs  that  will  face  them.  moreover,  polimi  has  built  strong  skills  for  azure  platforms  and  can  easily  recreate  a  similar  architecture  for  different  remote  monitoring  projects,  related  to  other  archaeological  sites.  customer  quote:  collaborating  with  microsoft  italy  proved  to  be  an  asset  in  the  development  of  our  iotbased  monitoring  system  at
__label__environmentmonitoring circus  maximus,  and  represents  a  stepping  stone  for  possibly  replicating  the  same  design  in  other  upcoming  projects.  sacrum  facere  convention,  the  archaeological  convention  organized  in  trieste  last  november  where  the  project  was  presented  by  luca  mottola  and  koustabh  dolui:
__label__environmentmonitoring for  many  businesses,  water  quality  monitoring  is  about  more  than  safeguarding  drinking  water.  water  monitoring  programs  are  implemented  for  a  wide  variety  of  reasonseven  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  quality  of  the  water  itself.  and  today,  its  easier  than  ever  to  find  out  whatever  you  need  or  want  to  know  about  your  specific  waterrelated  application  thanks  to  the  internet  of  things  iot.  so  how  are  smart  water  quality  monitoring  systems  using  the  iot  being  applied?  below  are  some  of  the  use  cases  were  seeing  most  commonly.  clearly,  water  quality  is  critical  to  crop  production.  poor  quality  water  in  general  can
__label__environmentmonitoring slow  plant  growth  and  negatively  impact  appearance.  in  addition,  certain  plants  grow  better  when  certain  characteristics  are  present  in  irrigation  water;  the  same  is  true  for  the  converseplant  growth  may  be  hindered  by  the  presence  of  certain  factors.  for  example,  water  with  a  toohigh  ph  level  an  indicator  of  acidity  could  be  detrimental  to  some  plants,  making  it  difficult  for  them  to  absorb  nutrients  from  the  soil;  others  are  less  affected  by  soil  ph  and  are  able  to  absorb  higher  levels  of  aluminum  or  magnesium  in  even  very  acidic  water.  another  issue  relates  to  salt  tolerance.  the  nutrients  plants  use
__label__environmentmonitoring for  development  are  absorbed  as  ionic  salts;  however,  some  plants  tolerate  high  salinity  while  others  will  not.  irrigation  water  ranges  in  salinity;  that  salinity  is  usually  measured  as  the  electrical  conductivity  of  water  because  dissolved  salts  in  water  conduct  electricity.  the  higher  the  conductivity,  the  higher  the  salt  concentration.  depending  on  the  type  of  crop  youre  trying  to  grow,  a  smart  water  quality  monitoring  system  can  help  maintain  the  optimum  conductivity  level  for  maximum  growth.  theres  significant  economic  value  in  monitoring  water  quality  for  the  ag  space.  it  can  be  an  extremely  useful  tool  for  managing  irrigation  water,  and  help
__label__environmentmonitoring farmers  maximize  crop  production.  many  cities  throughout  the  u.s.  use  water  quality  monitoring  equipment  continuously  to  evaluate  the  safety  of  their  water  supplies.  the  recent  ,  should  serve  as  an  important  reminder  to  municipal  governments  that  water  quality  cannot  be  overlooked.  drinking  water  is  typically  tested  for  the  presence  of  bacteria,  so  its  critical  to  examine  the  sterility  of  the  watercan  it  support  life?  the  oxidationreduction  potential  orp  essentially  measures  the  ability  of  water  to  break  down  contaminants;  therefore,  some  municipalities  use  orp  sensors  to  measure  the  dissolved  oxygen  in  water.  high  orp  levels  indicate  that  the  water  is  not
__label__environmentmonitoring capable  of  supporting  bacteria,  and  so  are  useful  in  determining  the  overall  quality  of  a  particular  water  supply  source.  aquaculture,  or  the  cultivation  of  aquatic  plants  and  fish,  requires  highquality  water  to  promote  production  and  increase  profitability.  many  facilities  now  use  water  quality  monitoring  equipment  to  measure  water  temperature  and  conductivity,  two  of  the  many  factors  that  can  affect  the  physical  condition  of  aquatic  animals.  optimal  water  quality  varies  by  species,  so  the  parameters  will  vary  across  the  industry.  water  quality  parameters  commonly  monitored  among  farming  systems  include  temperature,  dissolved  oxygen,  ph,  alkalinity,  hardness,  ammonia,  and  nitrites.  and  depending  on
__label__environmentmonitoring the  culture  system,  carbon  dioxide,  chlorides,  and  salinity  may  also  be  monitored.  just  about  every  building  has  an  invisible  network  of  pipes  that  carries  water  throughout  the  facility.  for  the  most  part,  its  difficult  to  detect  leaks  in  these  pipes,  and  even  when  theyre  found,  its  usually  after  much  water  has  already  been  lost.  pipe  leakage  is  responsible  for  a  significant  amount  of  water  loss  in  both  industrial/commercial  facilities  and  public  water  systems,  too.  thats  important  not  just  from  a  cost  perspective,  but  also  from  a  sustainability  perspectivewater  conservation  is  both  good  for  the  environment  and  good  for  business.  water
__label__environmentmonitoring flow  sensors  measure  the  flow  of  water  through  a  pipe  and  its  rate  of  change.  pulse  meters  are  helpful  in  understanding  the  rate  of  normal  flow,  and  therefore  present  a  way  to  detect  when  the  normal  rate  changes.  in  manufacturing  facilities,  flow  sensors  can  be  used  to  measure  the  volumetric  flow  rate  of  any  liquid,  gas,  or  steam.  changes  in  flow  rate  may  be  an  indicator  of  pipe  leakages  or  other  operational  malfunctions,  giving  building  managers  a  chance  to  address  problems  before  too  much  water  or  any  other  liquid  resource  is  wasted.  these  days,  a  building  is  more  than  just
__label__environmentmonitoring a  structure  with  a  roof  and  walls.  its  an  important  part  of  a  companys  operations  and  even  its  brand,  impacting  everything  from  the  bottom  line  to  the  work  environment  to  corporate  reputation  via  sustainability  efforts.  facilities  managers  are  facing  increased  demands  on  every  front  and,  thanks  to  technology  advancements,  they  have  the  unique  opportunity  to  add  value  like  never  before.  the  path  to  smarter  building  management  starts  with  measurementdata  gathered  via  iot  sensors  holds  the  key  to  your  specific  buildings  transformation.  iot  sensors  can  capture  a  vast  array  of  building  data  related  to  air  quality,  water  quality,  and  energy  efficiency,
__label__environmentmonitoring and  help  facilities  managers  glean  deeper  insights  about  operations  and  environmental  conditions.  the  road  to  improvement  is  devised  based  on  those  insights,  considered  together  with  the  goals  you  want  to  achieve.  a  holistic  approach  to  smart  building  management  encompasses  measuring  all  facets  of  building  performance  as  related  to  sustainability  and  resource  management.  in  working  with  businesses  and  building  managers  in  my  role  at  iota,  i  help  them  think  through  the  processes  performed  inside  the  facility.  we  establish  kpis  to  measure  benchmark  the  buildings  performance.  we  also  catalog  different  metrics  for  each  individual  process,  which  are  then  aggregated  to  reveal  the
__label__environmentmonitoring dynamics  of  how  they  play  against  one  another.  looking  at  each  step  in  relation  to  the  whole  process  and  cataloging  metrics  into  a  dashboard  allows  me  to  zero  in  on  the  details.  it  also  helps  build  a  mosaic  that  gives  a  complete  picture  of  facility  performanceand  reveals  your  specific  recipe  for  improvement.  whether  youre  a  municipality  interested  in  monitoring  your  public  water  supply  or  a  building  owner  interested  in  conserving  water  and  energy,  can  provide  you  with  the  right  water  quality  monitoring  equipment  for  your  needs.  well  also  help  you  determine  what  to  measure,  benchmark  your  performance,  and  customize  your

__label__environmentmonitoring gustavos  original  post,  click  .  i  am  building  this  project  to  play  with  sensors  ive  never  used  before:  i  have  added  certain  switches  in  the  firmware  to  enable  you  to  activate  or  deactivate  individually  any  of  the  sensors  so  you  can  pick  and  choose  only  the  ones  you  really  want  to  use.  each  sensor  can  generate  an  alarm  and  you  can  use  that  alarm  in  any  way  you  want,  for  instance:  an  email  or  a  notification  on  your  phone.  ill  be  using  a  .  the  photon  is  a  tiny  wifi  iot  device  for  creating  connected  projects  and  products  for  the
__label__environmentmonitoring internet  of  things.  its  easy  to  use,  its  powerful,  and  its  connected  to  the  cloud.  all  particle  hardware  is  designed  from  the  ground  up  to  work  with  the  device  cloud.  the  device  cloud  is  a  powerful  set  of  tools  and  infrastructure  to  build,  connect,  and  manage  your  iot  fleet.  this  little  beast  is  packed  with  many  wonderful  features.  if  you  havent,  check  it  out  right  away  i  chose  this  one:  .  the  mq5  sensor  is  used  in  gas  leakage  detecting  equipment  in  consumer  and  industry  applications.  this  sensor  is  suitable  for  detecting  ,  natural  gas  and  coal  gas.  there  is
__label__environmentmonitoring some  sensitivity  to  alcohol  and  smoke  as  well.  the  sensitivity  can  be  adjusted  with  an  onboard  potentiometer.  it  uses  the  standard  :  dfrobot  gravity  series  is  a  high  quality  opensource,  modular,  plug  and  play  electronics  toolkit  for  everyone  to  create  anything  easily.  with  powerful  expansion  shields,  various  professional  functional  modules  with  standard  interfaces  and  clear  documentations,  gravity  series  allows  users  of  any  skill  level  to  easily  connect  and  mix  to  realize  ideas  or  develop  projects.  since  the  analog  inputs  on  the  particle  device  tolerate  3.3  volts  maximum  and  the  sensor  has  a  5  volts  output  we  need  to  adjust  it.
__label__environmentmonitoring writes  it  well  on  this  post:  the  sensor  has  an  adjustable  load  resistor  rl  so  you  can  adjust  the  maximum  voltage  output/sensitivity  of  the  sensor.  you  can  power  the  sensor  with  5v  and  measure  the  output  using  a  voltmeter  not  connected  to  your  particle  just  yet.  adjust  the  trimpot  to  some  safe  value  below  3.3v  and  then  blow  some  smoke  on  the  sensor  to  see  how  it  reacts.  adjust  the  trimpot  so  the  voltage  never  exceeds  3.3v.  typically,  that  would  be  around  4700  ohms  or  so.  once  you  are  confident  that  the  output  voltage  will  not  exceed  3.3v,  you  can
__label__environmentmonitoring connect  it  to  your  particle.  if  possible,  disconnect  the  sensor  entirely  and  measure  the  set  resistance  of  the  trimpot  rl.  then  the  formula  vout  5  rl  /  rl  rs  where  rl  is  the  trimpot  resistance  and  rs  is  the  sensor  resistance.  you  can  solve  for  rs,  giving  if  im  correct:  rs  rl  5  vout  vout  you  can  then  get  the  ppm  from  the  datasheet  chart.  only  once  you  have  adjusted  the  output  to  max  at  3v3,  you  can  proceed  with  the  connection.  we  will  be  using  the  analog  pin  a0  to  read  the  data  from  this  sensor.  please  refer  to
__label__environmentmonitoring the  for  information  on  how  to  calibrate  this  sensor.  there  is  a  fsm  for  this  sensor  called  mq5statemachine.  if  the  reading  of  the  sensor  goes  over  the  value  stated  in  the  variable  mq5alarmthreshold  the  system  will  trigger  an  alarm  and  the  fsm  will  transition  to  the  alarm  state.  the  line  looks  like  this:  there  is  this  other  line  in  the  firmware  in  case  you  wanted  to  deactivate  this  sensor:  to  deactivate  it,  comment  the  line  above  like  this:  then  rebuild  and  flash.  i  used  a  mq7.  it  uses  an  mq7  probe  to  detect  carbon  monoxide  co  concentrations  in  the  air
__label__environmentmonitoring from  20  to  2000  ppm.  the  sensitivity  can  be  adjusted  with  an  onboard  potentiometer.  the  output  is  analog  and  proportional  to  the  density  of  the  gas.  we  need  to  do  the  same  thing  here  as  we  did  for  the  mq5  sensor.  please  refer  to  the  section  above  for  adjustment.  only  once  you  have  adjusted  the  output  to  max  at  3v3,  you  can  proceed  with  the  connection.  we  will  be  using  analog  pin  a1  to  read  the  data  from  this  sensor.  the  mq7  sensor  requires  switching  its  input  power  between  1.4  and  5  volts  in  cycles  of  90  and  60  seconds
__label__environmentmonitoring respectively.  this  in  turn  generates  a  low  and  high  temperature  in  the  sensors  internal  heater.  from  here:  during  the  low  temperature  phase,  co  is  absorbed  on  the  plate,  producing  meaningful  data.  during  the  high  temperature  phase,  absorbed  co  and  other  compounds  evaporate  from  the  sensor  plate,  cleaning  it  for  the  next  measurement.  once  everything  is  connected  as  in  the  picture  above,  calibrate  the  potentiometer  until  you  read  1.4  volts  and  connect  those  1.4  volts  to  the  normally  closed  nc  of  the  relay.  connect  the  normally  open  no  to  vin  on  the  particle  device.  the  input  of  the  relay  must  be
__label__environmentmonitoring connected  to  a4,  so  a4  as  digital  output  will  drive  the  90/60  seconds  cycle  on  the  relay.  finally,  the  output  of  the  sensor  goes  to  a1.  please  refer  to  the  sensors  datasheet  for  information  on  how  to  calibrate  this  sensor.  there  is  a  finite  state  machine  fsm  for  this  sensor  called  mq7statemachine.  if  the  reading  of  the  sensor  goes  over  the  value  stated  in  the  variable  mq7alarmthreshold  the  system  will  trigger  an  alarm  and  the  fsm  will  transition  to  the  alarm  state.  the  line  looks  like  this:  there  is  this  other  line  in  the  firmware  in  case  you  wanted  to

__label__environmentmonitoring motion  sensors.  this  pir  motion  sensor  can  detect  the  infrared  signals  from  human  body  or  other  animals  and  triggers  with  movement.  some  interesting  features:  ive  used  a  regular  water  sensor  with  two  pins  but  one  can  use  a  twisted  pair  of  wires.  i  have  another  project  that  uses  the  sensor  and  you  can  read  more  about  it  .  this  is  an  interesting  thought  from  :  water  unless  distilled  has  the  ability  to  conduct  electricity.  theoretically,  i  could  twist  two  pairs  of  wire  to  different  lengths,  and  determine  the  presence  of  water  based  on  a  short  across  either  pair.  unfortunately,  water
__label__environmentmonitoring makes  a  lousy  conductor,  so  there  will  be  losses  in  voltage  that  need  to  be  reconciled  in  order  to  measure  the  presence  of  the  short.  fortunately,  we  have  transistors  to  do  just  that,  and  whats  more,  we  have  a  darlington  pair,  which  is  a  double  dose  that  advice  is  coming  from  zacharys  project  listed  .  alright,  alright,  i  knew  that  water  could  conduct  electricity.  however  i  did  not  know  that  it  was  such  a  bad  conductor.  thats  something  that  can  be  improved  by  adding  a  couple  of  transistors  with  the  darlington  pair  the  mpsa13  transistor  darlington  pair.  finite  state  machines

__label__environmentmonitoring the  pir  and  water  leak  sensors  are  debounced  with  the  algorithm  described  .  it  reads:  this  is  an  algorithm  that  debounces  or  removes  random  or  spurious  transitionsof  a  digital  signal  read  as  an  input  by  a  computer.  this  is  particularly  applicable  when  the  input  is  from  a  mechanical  contact.  an  integrator  is  used  to  perform  a  time  hysteresisso  that  the  signal  must  persistentlybe  in  a  logical  state  0  or  1  in  order  for  the  output  to  change  to  that  state.  random  transitions  of  the  input  will  not  affect  the  output  except  in  the  rare  case  where  statistical  clustering  is  longer
__label__environmentmonitoring than  the  specified  integration  time.  its  pretty  solid  ive  been  using  it  in  many  of  my  projects.  in  this  project  i  used  a  smoothing  algorithm  created  by  michael  thessel  and  its  described  .  the  analogreadsmooth  function  averages  consecutive  output  readings.  you  can  define  how  many  readings  you  want  to  average  window  size.  choosing  a  large  window  size  will  smoothen  the  output  considerably  but  will  also  slow  down  detection  of  actual  signal  changes.  you  need  to  adjust  the  window  size  according  to  your  needs  when  instantiating  the  analogsmooth  object.  its  been  working  great  for  me.  once  the  system  detects  an  abnormal

__label__environmentmonitoring january  17,  2019  the  ,  also  known  as  iot,  has  been  growing  exponentially  over  the  last  decade.  in  just  a  few  years,  iot  usage  has  moved  from  simple  experiments  to  being  at  the  core  of  multiple  highscale  solutions.  as  a  matter  of  fact,  morgan  stanley  estimated  that  75  billion  devices  would  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  2020.  many  of  us  are  benefiting  from  iot  without  even  knowing  it.  whether  in  transportation,  manufacturing,  customer  service  or  else,  iot  is  everywhere  and  is  changing  the  world  for  better.  in  this  article,  we  will  pick  a  few  of  these  use  cases  and
__label__environmentmonitoring explain  the  power  and  revolution  iot  has  brought  to  our  society.  despite  the  advancement  in  manufacturing  and  industrial  processing,  many  companies  are  still  forced  to  use  a  breakfix  model.  without  advanced  sensors  and  technology  included  on  missioncritical  equipment,  it  can  be  hard  to  tell  when  a  machine  is  about  to  fail.  these  failures  can  be  extremely  dangerous  to  workers,  if  the  machine  fails  catastrophically.  this  is  one  of  the  reasons  why  industrial  companies  ,  have  not  only  focused  efforts  around  worker  safety  and  preventive  maintenance,  but  also  begun  relying  on  iot  devices.  here  is  the  process.  note  that  these  sensors
__label__environmentmonitoring can  be  recording  the  status  of  the  machinery  in  different  ways,  such  as:  temperature,  speed,  humidity,  etc.  also,  it  is  good  to  keep  in  mind  that  both  hardware  and  software  are  required  to  make  iot  a  reality.  a  connected  device  that  is  not  integrated  with  an  application  for  some  specific  purpose  is  useless.  the  benefits  are  instantaneous.  with  iot,  companies  are  able  to  collect  realtime  information  on  the  condition  of  their  equipment.  there  is  no  need  to  check  each  piece  of  equipment  individually.  these  manual  operations  that  are  not  only  timeconsuming,  but  also  difficult  or  sometimes  dangerous,  are  no  longer
__label__environmentmonitoring necessary.  the  crew  can  detect  anomalies  in  a  timely  fashion  and  actions  can  be  taken  to  immediately  remediate  the  situation.  actually,  remediation  can  even  be  automatized.  because  companies  can  better  monitor  their  equipment,  they  can  schedule  preventative  maintenance  based  on  data  gathered  by  iot  sensors.  when  the  application  processes  the  data,  it  is  able  to  detect  warning  signs.  this  way,  the  factory  engineers  can  plan  to  fix  failing  components  before  the  issue  becomes  worse.  the  integration  of  iot  in  the  manufacturing  and  industrial  ecosystem  helps  keep  workers  safe.  not  only  that,  it  increases  efficiency,  because  there  are  fewer  interruptions  due
__label__environmentmonitoring to  machinery  failure.also,  because  there  are  less  incidents  and  consequently  less  outages,  every  plant  productivity  increases.  this  can  help  drop  prices  for  consumers  and  increase  profit  margins  for  industrial  companies  which  is  a  winwin.  a  few  examples  of  companies  offering  iot  solutions  for  the  manufacturing  industry  include  ,  ,  and  .  this  is,  perhaps,  one  of  the  most  famous  applications  of  iot  technology.  it  is  safe  to  say  that,  without  iot  and  strong  wireless  networks,  selfdriving  cars  would  be  completely  impossible.  indeed,  just  a  few  decades  ago,  the  concept  was  looked  on  as  a  science  fiction  case.  but  today,  there
__label__environmentmonitoring are  more  companies  than  ever  exploring  selfdriving  cars.  the  potential  benefits  of  successful  research  from  companies  like  uber,  waymo,  ford,  and  dozens  of  other  companies  could  be  enormous.  we  have  seen  more  joint  deals  between  car  manufacturers  and  longtime  technology  companies,  but  there  are  also  technology  firms  joining  forces  together  such  as  .  and  more  efficient.  designers  of  future  cities  even  see  them  as  a  way  to  eliminate  parking  lots  and  structures,  creating  a  more  humanfriendly  environment.  it  remains  to  be  seen  when  selfdriving  cars  will  become  widespread  and  be  available  for  purchase.  they  may  be  available  to  the  public
__label__environmentmonitoring as  soon  as  2020,  and  .  but  regardless  of  how  soon  they  are  adopted,  selfdriving  cars  remain  a  revolutionary  use  case  for  iot.  asset  tracking  is  one  of  the  most  powerful  use  cases  for  iot.  it  may  come  as  no  surprise  that  there  are  already  dozens  of  iot  products  and  software  companies  dedicated  to  tracking  assets,  ranging  from  cars,  ,  to  construction  equipment,  and  more.  while  gps  global  positioning  system  has  been  widely  used  over  the  years,  new  location  services  have  made  their  entrance  on  the  market.  connected  devices  are  able  to  communicate  with  each  other,  which  makes  sensortosensor  communication
__label__environmentmonitoring a  good  alternative  to  gps.  consequently,  anything  large  enough  to  have  an  iot  sensor  and  receiver  attached  can  be  tracked  instantly,  around  the  world.  the  location  of  things  allows  for  the  quick  and  easy  geolocation  of  fixed  and  mobile  assets.  moreover,  because  sensors  can  collect  more  information  than  the  simple  positioning,  iot  is  offering  further  data  that  can  be  leveraged,  such  as  speed  or  surrounding  temperature.  the  capabilities  become  endless.  with  more  data  collected,  companies  can  better  understand  when  and  how  issues  occur,  and  even  prevent  them.  for  instance,  by  knowing  the  temperature,  speed  and  nature  of  the  road,  some
__label__environmentmonitoring companies  can  decide  on  rerouting  a  truck.  for  delivery  companies,  improved  tracking  means  better  logistics,  less  delays,  and  less  incidents.  some  of  the  companies  leading  innovation  in  this  space  include  ,  ,  telecom  giant  and  numerous  others.  as  time  goes  on  and  iot  becomes  even  more  affordable,  iotbased  asset  tracking  and  monitoring  is  sure  to  become  even  more  common.  the  population  of  the  world  is  aging.  due  to  the  expanding  world  population  and  advances  in  medical  technology,  lifespans  are  getting  longer.  it  is  predicted  that  between  2015  and  2030,  by  56,  from  900  millions  to  1.5  billion.  one  potentially  revolutionary
__label__environmentmonitoring application  for  iot  may  be  for  athome  medical  care.  many  people  today  are  choosing  to  in  their  own  homes  rather  than  live  in  an  assisted  living  facility.and  while  athome  caregivers  are  useful  for  helping  elderly  individuals  who  are  aging  in  place,  they  cannot  always  be  on  alert,  24/7.  thats  where  the  comes  in.  sensors  placed  in  the  home  and  worn  by  elderly  individuals  can  monitor  their  environment.  a  heart  rate  monitor  could  detect  excessive  exertion,  a  gyroscope  could  detect  falls  and  alert  authorities,  and  other  devices  could  monitor  the  health  and  wellbeing  of  elderly  individuals.  companies  like  ,  ,  and
__label__environmentmonitoring are  a  few  innovators,  focusing  on  wholehome  iot  for  senior  safety,  fall  prevention,  medication  reminders,  and  more.  as  the  population  continues  to  age,  were  sure  to  see  more  investment  in  smart  homes  for  athome  medical  care.  one  of  the  most  common  questions  about  the  internet  of  things  is  how  all  of  these  smart  solutions  will  be  powered,  and  the  answer  is  edge  computing.  while  iot  devices  can  collect  data,  they  are  not  designed  to  process  and  analyzed  it.  edge  computing  is  a  new  approach  to  computing  that  uses  edge  servers  smaller,  decentralized,  and  geographicallyclose  to  replace  and  support  data  centers.
__label__environmentmonitoring edge  servers  are  installed  just  a  few  hops  away  from  connected  devices,  so  data  can  be  quickly  collected  and  analyzed.  this  guarantees  low  latency  for  applications  and  high  data  processing  speeds  that  enable  innovations  like  selfdriving  cars.  if  youre  interested  in  building  an  iot  solution  with  a  platform  that  automate  the  deployment,  management  and  maintenance  of  iot  servers,  ormuco  is  the  perfect  partner  to  start  with.  our  ormuco  edge  solution  offers  you  to  manage  edge  workloads  through  a  unified  platform.  to  learn  more  about  ,  and  how  to  use  it  to  power  your  iot  use  cases,  please  or  feel  free

__label__environmentmonitoring keeping  assets  up  and  running  has  the  potential  to  significantly  decrease  operational  expenditures,  saving  companies  millions  of  dollars.  with  the  use  of  sensors,  cameras  and  data  analytics,  managers  in  a  range  of  industries  are  able  to  determine  when  a  piece  of  equipment  will  fail  before  it  does.  these  iotenabled  systems  can  sense  warning  signs,  use  data  to  create  maintenance  timelines  and  preemptively  service  equipment  before  problems  occur.  by  leveraging  streaming  data  from  sensors  and  devices  to  quickly  assess  current  conditions,  recognize  warning  signs,  deliver  alerts  and  automatically  trigger  appropriate  maintenance  processes,  iot  turns  maintenance  into  a  dynamic,  rapid  and  automated
__label__environmentmonitoring task.  this  approach  promises  cost  savings  over  routine  or  timebased  preventive  maintenance,  because  tasks  are  performed  only  when  they  are  needed.  the  key  is  to  get  the  right  information  at  the  right  time.  this  will  allow  managers  to  know  which  equipment  needs  maintenance;  maintenance  work  can  be  better  planned;  and  systems  remain  online  while  workers  stay  on  task.  other  potential  advantages  include  increased  equipment  lifetime,  increased  plant  safety  and  fewer  accidents  with  negative  environmental  impact.  a  smart  meter  is  an  internetcapable  device  that  measures  energy,  water  or  natural  gas  consumption  of  a  building  or  home,  .  traditional  meters  only  measure
__label__environmentmonitoring total  consumption,  whereas  smart  meters  record  when  and  how  much  of  a  resource  is  consumed.  power  companies  are  deploying  smart  meters  to  monitor  consumer  usage  and  adjust  prices  according  to  the  time  of  day  and  season.  smart  metering  benefits  utilities  by  improving  customer  satisfaction  with  faster  interaction,  giving  consumers  more  control  of  their  energy  usage  to  save  money  and  reduce  carbon  emissions.  smart  meters  also  give  power  consumption  visibility  all  the  way  to  the  meter,  so  utilities  can  optimize  energy  distribution  and  take  action  to  shift  demand  loads.  ,  smart  metering  also  helps  utilities:  according  to  a  study  by  infosys
__label__environmentmonitoring and  the  institute  for  industrial  management  at  aachen  university,  85  of  manufacturing  companies  globally  are  aware  of  asset  efficiency  practices,  but  only  15  of  those  surveyed  have  implemented  such  measures  at  a  systematic  level.  infosys  and  other  supporting  companies,  including  ibm,  bosch,  ge,  intel,  national  instruments  and  ptc,  have  launched  a  testbed  to  collect  asset  information  efficiently  and  accurately  in  realtime  and  run  analytics  to  aid  them  in  decisionmaking.  the  goal  of  asset  tracking  is  to  allow  an  enterprise  to  easily  locate  and  monitor  key  assets,  including  along  the  supply  chain  e.g.  raw  materials,  final  products  and  containers  to  optimize
__label__environmentmonitoring logistics,  maintain  inventory  levels,  prevent  quality  issues  and  detect  theft.  one  industry  that  heavily  relies  on  asset  tracking  is  maritime  shipping.  on  a  large  scale,  sensors  help  track  the  location  of  a  ship  at  sea,  and  on  a  smaller  scale,  they  can  provide  the  status  and  temperature  of  individual  cargo  containers.  one  benefit  is  realtime  metrics  on  refrigerated  containers;  these  containers  must  be  stored  at  constant  temperatures  so  perishable  goods  remain  fresh.  each  refrigerated  container  needs  to  be  equipped  with  temperature  sensors,  a  processing  unit  and  a  mobile  transmitter.  when  temperatures  differ  from  the  optimal  mark,  crew  can  be  notified

__label__environmentmonitoring asset  to  refer  to  products,  machines  and  devices  with  a  life  span  of  10  to  20  years  or  more.  im  also  talking  about  highly  valued  assets  with  complex  bills  of  material  bom.  that  covers  everything  from  wind  turbines,  power  generators,  oil  rig  pumps,  industrial  printers,  mri  scanners  to  earth  moving  bulldozers,  locomotives,  and  agricultural  equipment.  ill  also  look  at  typical  use  cases  and  provide  brief  insights  about  the  applicability  of  smart  assets.  as  well,  ill  suggest  ways  some  assets  can  help  mature  a  firms  overall  strategy.  im  saving  a  discussion  about  smart  cities  for  another  time  because  the  topic  deserves
__label__environmentmonitoring its  own  post.  the  first  concern  many  people  have  had  is  about  making  the  install  base  more  visible.  universally,  maintenance  heads  have  wanted  to  know  where  their  assets  are,  who  owns  them,  and  what  is  the  installed  configuration.  asset  management  systems  were  born  to  answer  these  needs,  but  they  havent  addressed  all  the  problems.  data  populated  at  the  point  of  sale  or  shipment  can  remain  static  after  assets  change  ownership,  locations  or  have  been  reconfigured.  that  makes  asset  management  more  complicated  as  the  time  goes  by.  in  the  smart  asset  era,  though,  firms  can  rectify  most  of  these  issues.  one
__label__environmentmonitoring reason:  new  industrial  assets  come  out  of  the  factory  with  the  intelligence  baked  in  thanks  to  cheap  computing,  instrumented  components,  and  affordable  connectivity.  another  reason:  existing  assets  can  be  retrofitted  with  addon  computing  capabilities,  sensors,  actuators,  encoders  and  data  acquisition  modules.  that  means  an  asset  can  now  report  its  location,  configuration  and  additional  metadata,  such  as  ownership  information,  license  status,  and  so  on.  that  achieves  the  goal  of  having  visibility  into  the  install  base.  once  the  plumbing  is  donesensors  are  present  and  relevant  data  is  flowing  to  the  clouda  door  opens  for  the  next  use  case  that  allows  for  remote
__label__environmentmonitoring monitoring  of  devices.  as  software  becomes  more  prevalent,  remote  troubleshooting  can  resolve  many  issues.  systems  can  perform  recalibrations,  configuration  changes,  software  and  firmware  patchingor  simply  rebootremotely.  whats  more,  customer  care  teams  can  now  potentially  perform  diagnostics  using  cloudbased  apps  that  send  commands  down  to  the  asset.  these  are  the  core  functionalities  of  an  iot  remote  monitoring  and  diagnostic  rmd  solution.  most  manufacturers  of  smart  products  and  industrial  devices  nowadays  have  reached  maturity  with  rmd.  obviously,  this  type  of  iotpowered  solution  optimizes  costs  and  is  tremendously  valuable.  service  departments  are  particularly  aware  of  how  rmd  reduces  onsite  visits,  produces  a  better
__label__environmentmonitoring ratio  of  fix  on  first  visit  and  improves  customer  satisfaction.  rmd  is  a  great  starting  point,  but  its  just  the  beginning.  i  strongly  believe  the  next  set  of  use  cases  can  unlock  enormous  business  value.  todays  technology  is  such  that  you  can  apply  predictive  maintenance  pm  and  avoid  unplanned  downtime  thanks  to  advances  in  machine  learning  and  data  science.  we  can  now  combine  information  from  multiple  sources,  such  as  streamed  machine  data,  operational  parameters,  and  asset  management  inputs.  when  we  add  that  to  historical  maintenance  records,  rootcause  analysis  reports,  and  expertise  in  mechanical  engineering,  its  possible  to  spot  anomalies  and
__label__environmentmonitoring correlate  them  with  early  symptoms  of  future  failures.  selflearning  models  improve  with  every  iteration  and  retrain  when  new  data  is  available  making  them  even  more  accurate  over  time.  whats  more,  we  can  now  use  a  wide  range  of  datasciencerelated  technologies  to  build  asset  reliability  models  that  are  the  basis  of  predictive  maintenance  solutions.  but  ill  cover  that  topic  in  a  separate  post.  at  any  rate,  predictive  maintenance  is  a  game  changer  for  many  maintenance  and  service  organizations.  it  saves  millions  by  avoiding  unplanned  downtime  for  industrial  assets  such  as  energyproducing  generators,  mining  operations,  aircraft  engines,  oil  pumps,  and  locomotives.  and
__label__environmentmonitoring when  it  comes  to  health  equipment  and  human  safety,  it  also  helps  prevent  collateral  damage  and  saves  lives  before  small  failures  escalate  into  fullblown  catastrophes.  and  this  is  not  the  end  of  journey.  when  a  service  organization  combines  the  power  of  iot  and  analytics  by  deploying  rmd  and  pm  solutions,  it  can  realize  even  more  business  benefits.  at  this  point,  weve  discussed  how  rmd  has  improved  the  way  assets  perform  in  the  field.  weve  also  described  how  we  can,  with  significant  accuracy,  predict  failures  in  all  critical  components  thanks  to  pm.  the  next  logical  step:  optimizing  spareparts  inventory  to  free
__label__environmentmonitoring up  working  capital  by  avoiding  overstocking.  understocking,  too,  can  have  significant  consequences  and  endanger  business  continuity.  this  solution  predicts  the  lifespan  of  critical  components  across  a  fleet  of  assets  and  generates  buy/nobuy  decisions.  this  use  case  is  especially  important  for  organizations  dealing  with  assets  with  overly  complex  boms,  with  long  lead  times,  such  as  manufacturing,  transport  or  installation,  or  with  madetoorder  parts  that  are  typically  expensive.  another  branch  of  iotenabled  benefits  is  in  the  integration  between  asset  management,  rmd,  and  pm  solutions  which  taps  into  service  force  schedule  and  dispatch  functionality.  a  seamless  flow  like  that  produces  astounding  customer  satisfaction.
__label__environmentmonitoring heres  how  it  works.  industrial  devices  report  their  conditions,  rmd  collects  data,  and  pm  predicts  failures.  armed  with  all  that  information,  a  field  service  system  can  plan,  schedule,  and  dispatch  field  technicians  equipped  with  all  the  tools,  parts,  and  knowledge  required  to  fix  the  problem  on  first  visit.  the  upshot:  fewer  service  calls,  field  technicians  work  proactively  on  a  predictable  schedule  and  customers  are  delighted  because  theirbusiness  experiences  little  or  no  disruption.  with  an  endtoend  information  flow,  field  technicians  can  have  visibility  into  a  realtime  data  when  dealing  with  a  faulty  device.  mobile  solutions  with  humanmachine  interfaces  provide  a  live
__label__environmentmonitoring view  of  operating  conditions,  current  and  historical  alerts,  plus  feed  from  knowledgebased  systems,  and  stepbystep  maintenance  instructions.  and  we  havent  even  begun  to  consider  additional  benefits  that  advanced  visualization  technologies,  such  as  augmented  reality,  virtual  reality  and  mixed  reality  can  bring.  i  focused  on  one  benefit  in  each  of  the  use  cases  i  just  discussed,  but  in  fact,  the  spectrum  of  benefits  is  broad  and  rich.  depending  on  your  organization,  business  priorities,  maturity  levels  and  strategy  you  may  well  select  other  starting  use  cases  for  your  smart  assets  management  solution.  but  its  best  to  keep  the  big  picture  in  mind.
__label__environmentmonitoring strategy  is  the  guiding  light  of  your  overall  digital  transformation  journey.  heres  a  map  of  example  solutions  and  typical  transitions  that  most  organizations  follow  as  their  iot  maturity  evolves:  clearly,  i  havent  dealt  with  the  wide  range  of  the  options  these  new  technologies  make  possible.  in  fact,  iot  and  industrial  analytics  can  offer  so  much  more.  heres  a  quick  look  at  a  few  prospects.  in  future  posts,  ill  go  into  greater  detail.  connected  devices  are  creating  a  wave  of  new  businesses  under  the  collective  name  product  as  a  service  paas.  in  many  cases  paas  replaces  tangible  products,  providing  power  by

__label__environmentmonitoring as  the  ones  enabling  most  internet  device  connectivity,  telecom  companies  are  well  positioned  to  be  one  of  the  biggest  players  in  iot.  while  their  current  spending  is  primarily  on  monitoring,  they  can  leverage  iot  to  augment  their  b2b  contracts  and  provide  new  services  for  customers.  having  already  connected  the  vast  majority  of  the  worlds  citizens  with  a  wireless  cellular  connection,  the  telecom  industry  is  naturally  one  of  the  largest  potential  players  in  the  iot  market.  as  a  matter  of  fact,  a  surface  level  connecting  devices  to  each  other  and  the  internet  already  has  players  such  as  att,  verizon  and  vodafone
__label__environmentmonitoring dominating  iot  since  the  advent  of  dialup  internet,  which  was  first  offered  commercially  by  sprint  in  july  1992.  since  then,  while  many  device  to  device  connections  have  flowed  through  them,  that  infrastructural  play  has  not  been  enough  to  satiate  telecom  companies.  in  2015,  tata  consultancy  services  found  that,  out  of  13  sectors,  telecom  ranked  fourth  when  it  came  to  spending  on  iot  technology.  in  2015,  companies  surveyed  spent  an  average  of  110.7  million  on  iot  per  company  and  expected  their  budget  to  substantially  increase  to  169.5  million  by  2018  a  69.5  percent  increase  over  3  years.  so  wheres  this  money
__label__environmentmonitoring being  spent?  according  to  the  tata  study,  33.4  percent  of  this  money  is  being  spent  on  monitoring  of  telecom  products  and  services  after  selling  to  customers,  30  percent  on  customers  monitoring  i.e.  usage  of  products  such  as  smart  watches  or  mobile  apps,  18.4  percent  on  onpremises  monitoring  or  tracking  customer  experiences  in  specific  businesses  such  as  amazon  go  and  18.1  percent  on  supply  chain  monitoring.  in  general,  the  telecom  industry  has  three  different  areas  of  investment  in  iot:  with  billions  of  dollars  in  expensive  cellular  base  stations  and  data  centers  deployed  worldwide,  telecom  companies  can  benefit  from  iot  enabled  remote
__label__environmentmonitoring monitoring  and  maintenance.  remote  cell  towers  include  many  pieces  of  auxiliary  equipment  that  allow  the  telecommunications  systems  to  work  and  are  essential  to  ensuring  no  network  downtime.  this  equipment  such  as  backup  generators,  air  conditioners  and  energy  meters  can  be  fitted  with  sensors  that  allow  telecom  operations  teams  to  remotely  monitor  the  health  of  individual  towers,  make  adjustments  that  increase  operational  efficiencies  and,  when  worst  comes  to  worst,  selectively  dispatch  crews  from  a  centralized  location.  since  this  infrastructure  is  highly  expensive  and  subject  to  the  theft  of  core  components  such  as  fuel  and  batteries,  an  iot  enabled  access  management  and
__label__environmentmonitoring intrusion  detection  system  would  provide  a  lot  of  value.  many  remote  sites  exist  in  harsh  environments,  so  fire,  water  and  air  quality  sensors  play  a  vital  role  in  avoiding  long  term  exposure  to  elements  which  may  irreparably  damage  core  infrastructure.  when  network  infrastructure  is  being  planned,  iot  can  be  introduced  to  ensure  efficient  network  design  and  optimization.  the  is  using  artificial  intelligence  to  simulate  networks  and  predict  optimal  connectivity.  this  technology  is  already  live  and  being  used  by  large  companies  such  as  softbank.  the  system  and  can  also  identify  the  frequency  strategies,  measure  future  capacity  bottlenecks,  and  all  for  different
__label__environmentmonitoring traffic  models,  supported  by  a  deep  understanding  of  the  geography  to  be  coveredand  minimize  capex  and  opex  for  iot  launch.  as  the  key  connectivity  service  providers  for  our  society  and  more  specifically,  the  business  world,  telecom  companies  stand  to  gain  by  developing  their  own  digital  and  physical  infrastructure  as  well  as  services  for  iot.  these  may  include  the  development  of  an  iot  platform  to  manage  devices  and  their  connectivity  to  the  telecom  companys  infrastructure,  the  development  of  new  connectivity  options  in  their  current  coverage  areas  such  as  deploying  low  power  wide  area  networks  from  their  preexisting  assets  and  proximity  sensing.

__label__environmentmonitoring in  iot  security,  concerns  and  confusion  remain.  an  iot  security  strategy  for  a  construction  company  has  to  focus  on  not  only  preventing  intrusion  but  also  quick  detection  and  recovery.  the  security  of  iot  implementations  continues  to  be  the  leading  impediment  to  deploying  iot  initiatives  in  the  construction  industry.  in  addition  to  a  reliance  on  mobile  devices  such  as  smartphones  and  laptops,  the  construction  industry  is  increasingly  adopting  new  technologies  like  .  iot  sensors  are  useful  because  they  provide  realtime  monitoring  and  data  collection,  while  virtual  reality  can  create  simulations  of  building  designs.  additionally,  iot  sensors  can  be  used  to  access
__label__environmentmonitoring data,  the  causes  of  physical  malfunction  of  physical  infrastructure,  ,  and  .  integrated  project  delivery  through  iot  technologies  opens  a  world  of  safety,  training  and  efficiency  opportunities,  but  also  increases  vulnerabilities  of  attacks  from  malicious  actors.  the  characteristics  of  the  construction  industry  make  it  a  challenging  environment  to  implement  ubiquitous  technologies  like  iot.  first,  the  construction  industrys  workforce  is  fluid;  many  construction  industry  employees  work  in  the  field  using  laptops,  smartphones,  and  tablets  rather  than  traditional  office  environments.  second,  reliance  on  subcontractors  can  present  unique  challenges,  including  training.  finally,  the  completion  of  any  project  typically  involves  dozens  of  companies  the
__label__environmentmonitoring sharing  of  vast  quantities  of  confidential  data  including  bids,  blueprints,  employee  records  and  financial  information.  forwardlooking  construction  companies  now  rely  heavily  on  cloud  infrastructure  to  manage  project  blueprints  and  sensitive  customer  data  needed  for  multimilliondollar  projects  across  wide  geographical  areas.  as  the  adoption  of  iot  technology  continues  to  grow  rapidly,  security  teams  have  to  consider  new  approaches  to  detect  stealthy  insiders  and  respond  to  sophisticated  threats  across  a  dispersed  digital  infrastructure.  in  addition  to  the  worksite  challenges  faced  by  construction  companies,  additional  hurdles  include  the  lack  of  adequately  skilled  staff,  inadequate  budgets  and  change  management  issues.  in  particular,  top  management
__label__environmentmonitoring in  the  sector  underestimates  the  threats  and  risks  that  arise  because  of  iot  deployments.  they  lack  guidance  on  particulars  and  scope  to  enable  them  to  assess  threats  and  manage  risk.  the  construction  sector  is  impacted  by  cyber  risks  that  arise  from  enterprisesystem  technology  and  projectspecific  technology.  enterpriserelated  risks  it  or  ot  security  are  well  understood  and  include  the  loss  of  client  data  or  confidential  project  information  data,  intellectual  property  and  sensitive  commercial  material,  employee  data,  subcontractor  and  supply  chain  management  data  and/or  financials  and  outage  or  disruption  related  to  critical  software,  applications,  data  or  networks.  iot  security  falls  under  projectspecific
__label__environmentmonitoring technology.  projectspecific  technologies  could  relate  to  asset  management  and  control  systems,  site  access,  monitoring,  or  other  operating  systems.  iot  security  is  the  protection  of  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and  availability  of  an  iot  solution  or  device.  iot  security  is  a  journey  which  starts  by  making  sure  the  organization  has  enough  knowledge  on  what  devices/solutions  to  buy,  how  to  perform  secure  integrations,  how  to  ensure  that  the  solution  or  device  operates  smoothly  and  efficiently  at  scale  and  how  to  enable  safe  and  secure  communications.  its  about  making  sure  the  iot  device/solution  operates  as  expected,  communicates  securely  and  has  enough  resilience  to  absorb
__label__environmentmonitoring attacks.  beyond  that,  good  iot  security  practices  ensure  that  no  rogue  devices  connect  to  the  iot  infrastructure  and  prevents  the  user  of  a  solution/device  from  doing  anything  unintended  by  the  designers  of  the  device  or  owners  of  the  data,  whether  by  accident  or  malice.  iot  security  is  about  making  everything  work  as  expected  and  keeping  unauthorized  users  and  authorized  users  who  could  be  a  threat  from  potentially  doing  anything  that  compromises  the  iot  system.  iot  is  the  best  space  to  launch  an  attack.  the  systems  are  usually  less  mature  in  terms  of  security  than  server  and  pc  systems.  the  remoteness
__label__environmentmonitoring of  some  of  the  devices  allows  for  the  attackers  to  be  physically  present  and  manipulate  hardware  at  their  leisure  which  would  not  happen  in  a  secure  office  setting.  the  best  approach  to  iot  security  is  built  around  the  before/during/after  approach.  before:  prevent  system  compromise  and  unauthorized  access.  during:  monitor  and  detect  a  breach  as  quickly  as  possible.  after:  quickly  assess  and  minimize  damage.  iot  security  focuses  on  the  following  broad  areas;  device  security  the  physical  destruction  or  attack  on  terminal  devices  such  as  sensors  and  rfid  tags,  data  security  data  loss  or  tampering,  access  management  privacy  and  confidentiality  and  active
__label__environmentmonitoring security  maintenance  of  control.  every  organization  that  deploys  iot  solutions  must  have  a  plan  to  ensure  trust,  identity,  privacy,  protection,  safety  and  security  of  devices  and  people.  its  important  to  recognize  that  an  iot  device  or  solution  is  likely  to  be  attacked  or  compromised  at  some  point  in  its  lifecycle.  leading  organizations  treat  security  as  a  manageable  risk  to  be  considered  and  countered  along  with  all  other  risks  they  manage.  the  first  step  in  managing  cyber  risk  is  to  identify  sources  of  potential  risk.  construction  companies  should  conduct  audits  that  gauge  employee  access  to  and  use  of  critical  and  sensitive
__label__environmentmonitoring data,  including  personally  identifiable  information  and  proprietary  corporate  assets.  this  audit  should  determine  who  has  access  to  such  information  and  critical  systems  and  take  stock  of  existing  capabilities  for  monitoring  inappropriate  system  access  and  potential  security  events.  once  completed,  businesses  should  develop  formal,  written  policies  regarding  the  use  of  corporate  networks,  and  ensure  that  access  to  sensitive  data  is  restricted  only  to  parties  that  require  it.  while  iot  security  practices  are  still  evolving,  a  set  of  best  practices  is  emerging:  make  iot  security  inherent  in  the  iot  process  from  the  start.  use  hardware  that  incorporates  security  features  beyond  encryption  or
__label__environmentmonitoring physically  secure  critical  technologies.  laptops,  smartphones,  tablets  and  portable  media  devices  along  with  emerging  technologies  that  are  often  present  on  construction  sites,  such  as  wearable  devices  can  present  significant  data  security  threats  if  lost,  stolen  or  hacked.  make  security  a  priority  for  everybody  involved  with  the  organization.  educate,  share  and  discuss  iot  security  best  practices.  stay  abreast  of  developments  in  iot  security  and  regularly  update  employees,  partners  and  vendors  on  how  to  identify,  avoid  and  report  potentially  malicious  activity  on  corporate  networks.  the  most  effective  way  to  handle  iot  security  is  to  treat  it  as  a  journey;  be  smart  and
__label__environmentmonitoring proactive  when  it  comes  to  iot  risks.  make  security  a  top  priority  for  everybody  in  the  organization  as  well  as  outside  partners  and  vendors.  dont  be  naive  and  appreciate  that  there  are  many  reasons  somebody  would  hack  your  iot  solution  ranging  from  thrill,  political  statements,  an  act  of  war  or  terror,  expectations  of  financial  gain  by  stealing  data  or  trade  secrets  for  competitive  advantage,  hobble  you  as  a  competitor,  disrupt  your  business  strategy  or  an  employee  attempting  to  exact  revenge.  you  should  reward  users  who  find  and  report  bugs  especially  defects  likely  to  expose  zeroday  exploits.  the  construction  industry  is
__label__environmentmonitoring heavily  decentralized  and  involves  several  stakeholders.  without  thorough  and  regular  training  and  buyin  from  all  personnel,  even  the  most  robust  cyber  risk  management  plans  can  be  rendered  ineffective.  businesses  should  also  implement  strong  internal  controls,  including  the  resetting  of  passwords  every  90  days,  multifactor  authentication  and  randomized  default  passwords.  use  the  most  current  operating  system  and  libraries  with  updated  firewalls  and  security  patches.  despite  the  added  expense,  investing  in  a  robust  set  of  firewalls  that  require  user  authentication  can  be  beneficial.  businesses  should  also  institute  secure  file  sharing,  advanced  email  and  web  filtering  and  separate  wifi  networks  for  subcontractors,  architects
__label__environmentmonitoring and  engineers.  use  automatic  updates  to  fix  and  patch  bugs  and  vulnerabilities  in  field  devices.  closely  monitor  thirdparty  risk.  assess  the  cybersecurity  processes  of  any  third  parties  that  access  or  retain  critical  data.  seek  to  build  favorable  hold  harmless  agreements  into  contracts  with  thirdparty  vendors.  also,  establish  procedures  to  evaluate  any  thirdparty  service  providers  if  applicable  and,  as  discussed,  review  their  agreements,  limiting  as  much  liability  to  your  company  as  possible,  and  assess  their  cybersecurity  processes.  develop  detailed  data  breach  response  plans.  planning  can  enable  an  organization  to  act  swiftly,  decisively  and  effectively  to  minimize  damage  from  a  breach  and
__label__environmentmonitoring any  resulting  claims  or  regulatory  actions.  purchase  cyber  insurance.  a  cybersecurity  breach  is  not  a  matter  of  if  but  when.  having  insurance  coverage  against  cyberattacks  makes  business  sense.  understand  that  iot  doesnt  have  a  security  silver  bullet.  the  scope  and  variety  of  iot  solutions  effectively  prevent  the  emergence  of  faultless  security  defense.  iot  technology  is  fluid,  the  solutions  are  continually  evolving  and  so  too  are  the  threats  and  attack  vectors.  iot  solutions  are  constantly  evolving  and  so  should  your  iot  defense  strategy.  while  cyber  insurance  policies  have  historically  been  most  often  associated  with  data  and  privacy  breaches,  todays  cyber  policies
__label__environmentmonitoring cover  the  failure  of  technology  and  the  resulting  interruption  or  loss  of  revenue.  be  smart  and  practice  good  cyber  hygiene  practices:  use  secure  passwords  from  password  generators  and  implement  multifactor  authentication  among  other  standard  security  measures.  most  security  breaches  take  advantage  of  wellknown  vulnerabilities  that  havent  been  addressed  despite  ample  alerts  and  most  attackers  are  known  to  you:  employees,  contractors  or  partners.  deploy  end  to  end  security,  from  the  device  to  the  cloud.  collaborate  with  partners  and  vendors  as  a  security  strategy.  choose  the  best  partners  and  build  security  into  your  iot  ecosystem  from  the  start  e.g.  ,  ,  ,
__label__environmentmonitoring ,  ,  ,  ,  and  are  iot  securityfocused  companies  among  others.  iot  security  isnt  something  you  should  tackle  alone.  find  and  collaborate  with  partners  inside  and  outside  your  organization.  extend  it  security  architecture  to  ot  and  then  augment  it  with  specific  security  needs,  issues  and  concerns  in  mind.  go  to  iot  security  conferences,  especially  events  where  your  peers  showcase  practical  implementations  being  deployed  and  share  best  practices.  adopt  industrysupported  standards  everywhere  theyre  available.  treat  proprietary  solutions  with  caution.  be  guided  by  standards  bodies  and  trade  associations.  e.g.  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  etc.  the  iot  industry  is  increasingly  coming
__label__environmentmonitoring together  to  drive  common  security  standards  and  best  practices.  seek  top  management  support  for  security  initiatives.  make  them  aware  that  iot  security  is  another  businesscritical  challenge  they  need  to  consider.  automate  and  monitor  iot  security  end  to  end.  manual  efforts  cannot  keep  pace  with  the  volume  of  events  in  an  iot  ecosystem.  cocreate  solutions  with  it  vendors  to  expand  software  capabilities  to  handle  iot  security  vulnerabilities.  investment  in  iot  security  has  to  be  commensurate  with  the  likelihood  of  risk  and  the  potential  value  of  the  loss  or  damage.  different  types  and  levels  of  vulnerability  produce  different  threats  with  the  potential
__label__environmentmonitoring for  different  damage.  the  best  way  to  protect  your  organization  is  to  start  with  solid  risk  identification,  assessment  and  management.  like  all  businesses,  construction  companies  must  adopt  a  robust  cybersecurity  risk  management  strategy  and  take  the  time  to  understand  the  exposures  associated  with  iot  deployments.  iot  technology  can  be  a  source  of  strength,  but  any  breach  or  technology  interruption  that  disrupts  critical  workflows  and  operations  can  lead  to  project  delays  and  substantial  losses  for  the  business  and  other  project  stakeholders.  however,  security  is  not  a  technology  issue.  deploying  iot  means  your  organization  is  becoming  a  digital  enterprise  which  needs  an
__label__environmentmonitoring integrated,  companywide  security  strategy  and  risk  management  plan  that  involves  employees  at  every  level.  more  emphasis  has  to  be  placed  on  security  policies,  best  practices  and  tools  that  autonomously  prioritize,  contain  and  defeat  attacks  based  on  sound  risk  management  as  part  of  everything  the  company  does.  separation  of  systems  or  staying  offline  as  a  security  strategy  is  no  longer  imaginable  and  neither  is  it  the  most  effective  approach  of  operating  a  modern  business.  without  seamless  interoperability  and  integration,  there  is  little  improvement  in  business  outcomes  and  hence  no  reason  for  iot.

__label__environmentmonitoring to  objects  with  cognition.  its  that  idea  of  cognition  that  sparks  the  imagination  of  innovators  across  a  wide  variety  of  industries.  were  increasingly  seeing  products  that  use  sensors  to  recognise  context  and  circumstance  and  are  able  to  adapt  the  way  they  work  accordingly.  and  the  potential  is  enormously  exciting.  the  data  these  products  generate,  harness  and  share  with  each  other,  helps  to  create  better  consumer  experiences,  increasing  the  performance  and  efficiency  of  our  things,  while  ultimately  making  the  world  safer,  greener  and  improving  quality  of  life.  think  of  roads  which  can  detect  congestion  and  adverse  weather  conditions,  implementing  variable  speed

__label__environmentmonitoring are  becoming  smart  at  an  even  faster  pace:  from  a  us  smart  buildings  market  size  of  179  million  in  2014,  it  grew  to  286  million  in  2017,  and  .  its  only  the  tip  of  the  iceberg,  but  smart  thermostats  are  a  great  example  of  how  the  iot  can  add  extra  value  to  ageold  products.  while  central  heating  systems  have  historically  worked  on  an  on/off  or  timer  basis,  smart  thermostats  can  be  controlled  remotely  using  a  companion  app  on  your  smartphone.  this  means  you  can  adjust  the  temperature  of  your  home  manually,  wherever  you  are,  as  long  as  you  have  an
__label__environmentmonitoring internet  connection.  its  incredibly  convenient  and  can  be  a  big  energysaver,  as  well,  reducing  the  need  for  unnecessary  usage.  but  thats  only  the  start.  .  for  example  some  energy  companies  tailor  the  cost  of  power  throughout  the  day,  so  it  costs  more  when  its  in  demand.  ,  delivering  optimal  comfort  and  cost  savings  for  occupants  at  the  same  time.  connected  hvac  products  could  also  be  a  key  player  in  the  battle  against  polluted  indoor  air.  in  a  world  where  indoor  air  pollution  is  25  times  worse  than  outdoor  air  and  air  pollutants  cause  over  50,000  deaths  per  year  in  the
__label__environmentmonitoring us,  as  well  as  nearly  13,000  in  the  uk  the  importance  of  clean  air  has,  understandably,  taken  on  great  importance.  whereas  once  upon  a  time,  an  air  purifier  would  have  needed  to  be  in  constant  operation,  with  little  real  intelligence  for  the  user  regarding  its  effectiveness,  the  iot  changes  the  game.  sensors  fitted  into  air  purifiers  can  turn  them  into  truly  smart  devices.  theyre  able  to  detect  the  level  of  pollution  in  the  air,  responding  by  cleaning  the  air  in  the  most  efficient  way  possible,  saving  on  hours  of  constant,  often  unnecessary  use.  in  simple  terms,  when  people  ask  us
__label__environmentmonitoring whats  the  future  of  hvac?  we  tell  them,  unequivocally  its  all  about  smart  devices,  interpreting  and  measuring  their  environment,  and  responding  accordingly  to  maximise  human  experience  while  optimising  efficiency  and  product  lifespan.  one  of  the  most  common  misconceptions  we  see  around  the  adoption  of  iot  into  hvac  products  is  that  it  requires  the  timeconsuming  and  expensive  development  of  new  products.  this  isnt  quite  right.  the  combination  of  iot  and  hvac  systems  sees  a  number  of  different  wireless  sensors,  smart  vents  and  other  technologies  come  together  and  add  intelligence  that  helps  the  two  communicate.  and,  of  course,  this  means  that  existing
__label__environmentmonitoring hvac  products  can  be  retrofitted  with  iot  connectivity,  by  incorporating  the  right  sensors  and  software.  when  we  think  of  sensors  we  probably  think  of  standalone  devices,  whose  only  purpose  is  to  measure  .  the  reality  is,  the  iot  turns  things  into  sensors.  just  as  cars  themselves  could  become  the  sensors  on  our  smart  motorways  capturing  and  communicating  data  around  weather,  road  conditions  and  air  quality  hvac  products  could  themselves  become  the  sensors,  springing  into  life  as  and  when  theyre  required.  and  thats  not  all.  the  sensor  data  enables  hvac  systems  to  correctly  adjust  themselves  with  the  relevant  information,  while  the
__label__environmentmonitoring sensors  also  provide  a  trail  of  status  that  are  helpful  in  terms  of  maintenance  and  repairs  which  can  then  send  alerts  once  a  serious  problem  has  been  detected.  the  list  of  benefits  associated  with  connected  hvac  products  is  immense.  it  includes:  products  can  be  measured  and  monitored  in  realtime,  giving  a  clear  and  accurate  picture  of  their  performance  and  identifying  any  issues  with  their  performance  in  good  time.  instead  of  arbitrarily  servicing  products  at  fixed  periods,  iot  allows  problems  to  be  identified  before  they  become  major  issues,  saving  on  repair  bills  and  increasing  the  lifespan  of  your  products.  where  problems
__label__environmentmonitoring do  occur,  they  can  often  be  diagnosed  remotely,  saving  customer  callout  fees.  since  products  arent  required  to  work  constantly  whether  required  or  not  theyre  able  to  deliver  optimal  results,  whether  its  maintaining  the  right  room  temperature,  or  removing  pollutants  from  the  air,  while  using  a  fraction  of  the  energy  used  by  timerbased  operation.  a  smart  system  can,  for  example,  decrease  ventilation  flow  when  nobodys  inside  the  building  just  one  of  the  ways  in  which  significant  save  energy  can  be  saved.  the  idea  of  fully  automated  buildings  isnt  a  completely  new  one.  the  bacnet  protocol  a  data  communication  protocol  for  building
__label__environmentmonitoring automation  and  control  networks  has  been  in  development  since  1987.  but  were  increasingly  seeing  the  emergence  of  new  tech  which  makes  the  idea  of  the  automated  smart  building  a  reality,  rather  than  a  futuristic  vision.  for  hvac  products,  iot  functionality  gives  them  the  power  to  communicate,  share  data  with  each  other  and  process  that  data  into  operating  smarter,  more  efficiently,  driving  optimal  efficiency  across  a  range  of  products.  the  idea  of  standalone  products  working  in  isolation  looks  set  to  be  left  firmly  in  the  past.  were  still  in  the  first  wave  of  the  iot  revolution,  but  already,  the  positive  effects

__label__environmentmonitoring is  a  hot  buzzword  across  many  industries  these  days,  but  the  hvac  industry  is  seeing  iot  implementation  as  much  as  any.  iot  has  different  implications  in  each  industry  and  hvac  might  not  seem  like  the  first  place  you  would  find  iot  applications.  however,  when  you  consider  the  advancements  the  hvac  industry  has  seen  in  recent  years,  hvac  and  iot  go  hand  in  hand  to  not  only  transform  the  spaces  we  occupy  each  day  but  also  fundamentally  change  the  way  we  use  our  heating  and  cooling  systems.  iot  is  the  future  of  many  industries  and  hvac  is  no  exception.  the  implementation
__label__environmentmonitoring of  smart  sensors  has  allowed  hvac  systems  to  do  much  more  than  simply  heat  or  cool  our  homes  and  offices.  different  sensors  help  automate  operations  and  improve  the  overall  functionality  and  comfort  provided  by  hvac  systems.  these  sensors  connect  to  the  central  control  system  via  iot  to  provide  important  data  for  more  effective  operation  and  environment  control.  transmit  information  via  iot  to  hvac  systems  for  more  precise  temperature  control  and  more  comfortable  environments.  of  course  temperature  sensors  are  important  in  an  hvac  system  but  humidity  detection  also  plays  a  major  role  in  how  an  hvac  system  operates.  allow  an  hvac
__label__environmentmonitoring system  to  detect  humidity  inside  and  outside  a  building  to  accurately  adjust  the  workload  and  run  more  efficiently.  other  environmental  factors  also  contribute  to  the  comfort  and  quality  of  air  in  the  spaces  we  live.  accurate  are  able  to  transmit  co2  levels  to  the  hvac  system  to  help  in  thorough  ventilation  and  improved  air  quality.  iot  makes  it  possible  for  these  types  of  sensors  to  work  in  conjunction,  allowing  hvac  systems  to  provide  more  comfortable  and  efficient  spaces.  hvac  control  systems  made  possible  by  iot  have  truly  revolutionized  how  hvac  solutions  operate  to  allow  centralized  or  remote  control,  comprehensive  data
__label__environmentmonitoring analysis  and  cloud  integration  for  efficiency,  comfort  and  performance  that  was  never  possible  before.  these  control  systems  allow  for  full  integration  into  the  bms  building  management  system  of  a  building  and  provide  centralized  and  remote  control,  which  makes  it  much  more  convenient  to  manage  a  large  scale  hvac  system.  advanced  scheduling  and  regional  control  of  an  hvac  system  also  streamlines  operations  in  a  building  for  optimal  efficiency  and  comfort.  another  factor  made  possible  for  optimized  efficiency  and  comfort  is  data  analysis  through  iot.  data  collection  and  analysis  allows  the  system  and  system  administrators  to  better  comprehend  how  the  building  operates

__label__environmentmonitoring adapt  to  changing  technologies  and  business  requirements.  some  iot  systems  incorporate  user  feedback  on  space  conditions  to  adjust  temperatures  as  needed.  over  time,  such  systems  learn  user  preferences  to  maximize  both  comfort  and  energy  savings.  thermostats  control  the  condition  of  a  space  to  a  given  temperature,  but  the  temperature  setting  does  not  necessarily  translate  to  occupant  comfort,  the  gsa  writes  in  its  exploration  of  socially  driven  ,  a  type  of  usedriven  technology  that  adjusts  space  conditions  based  on  ongoing  occupant  feedback.  the  temperature  at  which  a  single  individual  is  comfortable  varies  according  to  conditions  such  as  humidity  level,  airflow,  sunlight,
__label__environmentmonitoring heat  from  office  equipment  and  drafts,  as  well  as  the  individuals  activity  level.  thermostats  can  over  or  underheat  or  cool  a  space,  resulting  in  wasted  energy,  occupant  discomfort  and  reduced  productivity.  compounding  the  problem  in  large  buildings  is  the  unavailability  of  even  simple  thermostats  for  many  occupants,  the  gsa  notes.  if  an  occupant  in  one  of  these  buildings  is  uncomfortable,  they  cant  just  adjust  the  thermostat  they  have  to  initiate  a  work  order  with  the  facilities  staff  and  wait  for  adjustments.  iot  technologies,  particularly  those  with  usedriven  functionality,  can  react  faster;  some,  like  the  socially  driven  hvac  optimization  software,  will
__label__environmentmonitoring gradually  return  spaces  to  conditions  that  save  more  energy  after  the  immediate  comfort  problem  is  satisfied.  if  usedriven  temperature  adjustment  isnt  feasible,  consider  at  least  allowing  occupants  to  adjust  the  temperature  in  their  space  within  a  tolerable  band.  set  a  maximum  power  consumption  limit,  but  allow  temperatures  to  fluctuate  a  few  degrees  so  that  occupants  can  make  their  spaces  somewhat  more  comfortable.  ,  according  to  gartner  research.  devices  are  a  hackers  dream  they  must  make  realtime  bidirectional  internet  connections,  a  type  of  communication  thats  tough  to  protect,  and  security  for  iot  devices  is  not  nearly  as  advanced  as  protocols  are

__label__environmentmonitoring to  positively  impact  buildings  by  optimizing  services,  energy  efficiency  and,  ultimately,  tenant  satisfaction.  but  the  increase  in  sensors  and  connected  devices  can  start  to  create  a  lot  of  noise  that  become  hard  to  filter  out  the  signal  from.  service  providers  need  to  start  with  a  baseline  of  the  insights  into  the  asset  in  order  for  it  to  be  iotactionable.  then,  these  insights  have  to  be  connected  to  an  asset,  its  condition,  location  and  performance.  asset  tracking,  when  done  right,  can  provide  the  necessary  identifiers,  in  this  case  things  like  the  brand  name,  the  model  number,  the  serial  number,  age,  run
__label__environmentmonitoring time,  unit  efficiency  and  its  impact  on  the  buildings  performance.  all  of  those  pieces  of  information  enhance  the  ability  to  appropriately  respond  to  a  stress  signal  reported  from  an  iotenabled  device.  the  promise  that  iot  holds  is  a  steep  upward  trajectory  in  customer  satisfaction.  for  example,  when  the  weather  is  hot  or  extremely  cold,  an  hvac  emergency  service  call  needs  to  be  addressed  in  a  very  short  window  of  time.and  when  hot  weather  strikes,  often  many  hvac  systems  break  down  and  it  can  be  very  hard  to  triage  all  those  requests  while  maintaining  a  high  service  level,  meeting  the  service
__label__environmentmonitoring level  agreement  that  you  have  with  the  client.  with  the  ,  service  providers  are  able  to  do  better  than  relying  on  the  client  to  reactively  report  a  problem.  an  apartment  complex  might  be  getting  a  complaint  from  a  tenant  some  hours  after  the  problem  actually  starts,  and  then  by  the  time  they  get  a  service  request  initiated,  several  hours  more.  and  by  the  time  the  contractor  is  on  the  scene  to  resolve  the  issue,  it  is  possible  days  or  a  week  or  more  has  passed.  it  is  rare  that  a  piece  of  equipment  would  be  operating  with  perfect  efficiency  and
__label__environmentmonitoring then,  all  of  a  sudden,  fails  to  function.  what  typically  occurs  is  a  period  of  degradation  that  starts  in  the  equipment,  and  being  able  to  detect  that  degradation,  when  things  are  starting  to  go  bad,  before  a  complete  failure,  is  some  of  iots  value.  the  early  warning  signal  that  somethings  wrong  prolongs  the  service  level  timeline.  if  that  detection  occurs  days  or  even  weeks  ahead  of  the  actual  failure,  what  could  have  been  a  fourhour  emergency  job  now  becomes  a  job  that  can  be  scheduled  with  advance  notice  not  inconvenience  tenants.  the  luxury  of  more  lead  time  is  the  benefit
__label__environmentmonitoring of  iot.  there  is  also  a  growing  amount  of  add  on  sensors  that  can  retrofit  units  for  iot  insight.  for  example  sensor  kits  that  might  have  refrigerant  pressures  inside  the  unit,  pre  and  post  filters,  provides  additional  insights  into  the  operation  of  that  unit,  enabling  the  user  to  do  more  than  just  remotely  detect  a  problem,  but  instead,  remotely  diagnose  it.  besides  efficiency,  there  are  plenty  of  marketing  benefits  for  an  iot  enabled  building.  in  2016,  a  survey  was  conducted  by  wakefield  research  that  showed  said  that  they  would  pay  extra  for  properties  set  up  with  smart  technologies.  one  of
__label__environmentmonitoring the  big  reasons  for  that  is  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  concerns.  smart  devices,  iot,  smart  thermostats  are  not  just  providing  savings  for  tenants,  but  also  improving  the  overall  ecofriendliness  of  multifamily  facilities  and  also  increasing  tenant  satisfaction.  when  you  speak  with  multifamily  and  commercial  property  owners  and  operators  today  and  ask  about  asset  management,  they  often  think  of  assets  as  the  four  walls  of  the  building,  the  year  it  was  built,  the  square  feet,  the  number  of  bedrooms.  they  are  not  considering  building  systems  like  hvac,  water  heaters,  electrical  or  any  of  the  other  subsystems  that  make  up  that  particular
__label__environmentmonitoring property.  the  initial  costs  of  connecting  an  hvac  system  will  only  go  down  with  time.  old  units  will  be  able  to  be  easily  retrofitted  with  state  of  the  art  often  wireless  sensors.  new  units  will  ship  from  the  factory  with  sensors  embedded  in  them.  connected  hvac  will  just  become  the  new  normal.  the  thermostat  itself  might  even  disappear  as  part  of  this  evolving  product  space.  metering  will  be  effortless  and  predictive  analytics  will  be  laid  seamlessly  on  top  of  it.  in  the  very  near  future  we  will  no  longer  have  to  hear  about  how  hvac  will  implement  iot.  the  will
__label__environmentmonitoring become  one  and  the  same.  any  modern  hvac  system  will  be  yet  another  spoke  on  an  iot  hub  and  any  good  buildings  iot  will  have  to  have  granular  hvac  input  as  part  of  its  dashboard.  in  the  very  near  future  when  we  think  about  facilities  management  we  wont  think  of  a  greasy  guy  with  a  wrench  in  the  basement,  but  a  technician  in  a  control  room  monitoring  over  a  vast  iot  network.  in  some  buildings,  that  is  already  the  case.  required  fields  are  marked  propmodo  is  a  global  multimedia  effort  to  explore  how  emerging  technologies  affect  our  built  environment.  propmodo
__label__environmentmonitoring iot  and  ai  are  radically  transforming  the  way  hvac  works.  in  the  135  year  history  of  hvac  technology,  nothing  has  even  come  close  in  terms  of  impact.  various  exist  for  entering  the  iot  market.the  debate  about  iot  market  strategies  will  continue  because  of  the  bold  projections  for  the  iot  market.  unfortunately,  hype  leads  to  myth,  and  myth  leads  to  confusion.  moving  forward  means  taking  a  step  back  to  look  for  clues  about  how  the  iot  market  could  evolve.  lets  dive  into  a  practical  example  from  the  to  see  how  the  future  of  hvac  systems  is  intertwined  with  ai  and  iot.
__label__environmentmonitoring hvac  controls  have  been  a  key  focus  of  the  smart  home  market.  as  recently  as  2017,  .  hvac  controls  have  existed  for  a  while.  the  first  thermostat  was  patented  in  1883  ,  hot  air  furnaces  operating  in  the  basement  of  the  building  heatedclassrooms.  school  custodians  controlled  the  heat  through  handoperated  dampers  based  on  periodic  assessments  of  the  classroom  temperature.  the  teacher,  warren  johnson,  sought  to  eliminate  these  classroom  disruptions  and  developed  the  technology  to  maintain  a  constant  temperature  in  the  classroom.  genius  known  today  as  johnson  controls.  the  technology  for  automated  room  temperature  control  has  existed  for  135  years  has
__label__environmentmonitoring much  changed  in  the  basic  temperature  control  architecture  during  that  span  of  time?  sadly,  we  could  say,  not  really.  even  today,  data  from  a  single  temperature  sensor  controls  the  actuation  of  most  hvac  units  in  homes.  smart  thermostats  are  a  very  recent  innovation,  at  least  within  the  135year  history  of  hvac.  what  makes  a  thermostat  smart?  programmable  schedules  and  vacation  modes?  no.  internet  connectivity?  not  enough.  in  one  definition,  smart  thermostats  must  have  more  than  twoway  communication  and  a  recent  example,  glasby  johnson  controls,  includes  multiple  onboard  sensors  that  allow  the  device  to  adapt  to  your  schedule.  glas  even  supports
__label__environmentmonitoring voice  commands  for  user  comfort  controls.  interestingly,  a  thirdparty,  cloudbased  voice  assistant  amazon  alexa  can  pass  control  commands  such  as  set  the  thermostat  to  x  degrees  to  glas.  this  thirdparty  control  interface  represents  a  new  thermostat  architecture  that  decouples  the  hardware  hvac  unit  signaling  from  the  software  algorithms.  as  has  been  known  for  135  years,  an  onsite  thermostat  device  can  physically  transmit  a  signal  that  changes  the  operation  of  the  hvac  unit.  the  software  algorithms,  on  the  other  hand,  can  exist  offsite  in  a  separate,  cloud  environment.  the  decoupling  of  the  algorithms  from  the  onsite  thermostat  control  allows  us  to
__label__environmentmonitoring visualize  the  interplay  between  ai  and  iot.  assume,  for  example,  that  a  thermostat  be  it  basic  or  smart  exists  in  a  home.  regardless  of  the  actual  thermostats  capabilities,  a  cloudbased  ai  analytics  engine  can  implement  hvac  algorithms  in  a  thirdparty  application  layer.  the  ai  analytics  engine  would  need  data  to  run.  where  would  it  get  the  data?  iot,  of  course.  iot  sensors  can  be  installedthroughout  a  home  to  collect  data  from  every  roomnot  just  the  room  with  the  thermostat.  the  iot  sensors  transmit  data  to  the  cloud  for  processing  by  the  ai  analytics  engine.  hvac  commands  produced  by  the  ai
__label__environmentmonitoring algorithms  and  delivered  to  the  thermostat  would  ultimately  optimize  and  control  the  hvac  unit.  certainly,  the  decoupling  of  the  sensors  from  the  thermostat  control  unit  would  represent  a  significant  change  from  the  automated  room  temperature  control  invented  135  years  ago.  lets  take  this  inquiry  further.  would  the  existence  of  iot  sensors  lead  to  the  development  of  better  ai  analytics  engines?  or,  would  the  existence  of  ai  analytics  engines  lead  to  the  installation  of  more  iot  sensors?  many  companies  have  already  placed  bets  on  this  question.  certainly,  the  investment  community  has  weighed  in  as  well.  it  isnt  quite  a  chicken  and
__label__environmentmonitoring an  egg  problem,  but  it  does  reveal  the  interplay  between  ai  and  iot.  ai  is  the  domain  of  subject  matter  experts  smes.  spread  across  countless  industries,  these  smes  already  have  existing  algorithms.  they  need  data,  lots  of  it.  if  this  theory  prevails,  then  ai  may  certainly  lead  the  way  for  iot  in  terms  of  demand  for  data.  consider  the  flip  side.  if  widespread  iot  deployments  were  a  reality,  then  vast  stores  of  data  would  exist.  algorithms  could  quickly  emerge  to  leverage  that  data.  under  this  theory,  the  existence  of  iot  data  would  lead  the  way  for  ai.  iot  and  ai

__label__environmentmonitoring are  major  concerns.  much  like  computers,  iot  devices  connect  to  each  other  using  internet  transfer  protocols.  the  http  in  website  addresses  stands  for  hypertext  transfer  protocolthe  most  prevalent  protocol  in  useand  many  of  us  upload  large  drawing  files  to  ftp  sites  using  the  almostaswellknown  file  transfer  protocol.  there  are  a  number  of  commercial  platforms  connecting  iot  devices  to  data  networks,  including  amazon  web  services,  microsoft  azure,  thingworx  iot  platform,  ibms  watson,  cisco  iot  cloud  connect,  salesforce  iot  cloud,  oracle  integrated  cloud,  and  ges  predix.  related:  these  platforms  vulnerability  to  cyberattack  remains  to  be  seen.  we  do  know,  however,  that  ,
__label__environmentmonitoring only  100  respondents  did  not  consider  themselves  vulnerable  to  data  threats.  obviously,  as  more  devices  become  connected,  cyberattacks  will  increase,  perhaps  by  means  of  controls  you  just  designed  or  installed.  in  addition  to  hvac  controls  such  as  thermostats,  individual  mechanical  components,  such  as  actuators  for  control  dampers,  can  be  directly  monitored  and  controlled  via  iot.  this  permits  digital  communication  without  the  need  for  a  separate  control  panel.  iot  also  can  use  cloudbased  platforms,  eliminating  the  need  for  an  onsite  computer  and  server  application.  in  our  hvac  world,  the  opportunities  for  iot  solutions  are  limited  only  by  our  imaginations  and  our
__label__environmentmonitoring clients  budgets.  many  of  the  functions  now  being  performed  by  sophisticated  building  management  systems,  such  as  direct  monitoring  and  management  of  hvac  performance  and  realtime  scheduling  from  a  mobile  device  or  your  smart  tv  if  your  kids  will  let  you  use  it,  are  becoming  simpler.  follow  us:
__label__environmentmonitoring the  international  telecommunication  union  or  itu  defined  internet  of  thingsiot  as  a  global  infrastructure  for  the  information  society,  enabling  advanced  services  by  interconnecting  physical  and  virtual  things  based  on  existing  and  evolving  interoperable  information  and  communication  technologies.  the  iot  have  changed  the  ways  hvacr  being  monitored,  analyzed  and  controlled  in  ways  that  were  never  dreamed  of  a  decade  ago.  energy  efficiency,  comfort,  remote  monitoring,  remote  control  and  ease  of  maintenance  are  some  of  the  advantages  as  a  result  of  using  the  power  of  the  internet.  conventional  controls  we  will  take  an  example  of  ductless  split  units  that  have  been  growing
__label__environmentmonitoring rapidly  due  to  their  simplicity  of  installation  and  affordability.  the  typical  standalone  or  limited  networked  controls  are  confined  to  the  particular  unit  or  the  local  network  within  the  building.  the  standalone  units  are  usually  cost  sensitive  products  where  the  controls  are  done  using  wireless  handset  or  wired  controlled  thermostats.  newer  units  may  have  builtin  sensors  that  help  to  detect  the  presence  of  occupants.  this  data  is  used  to  set  the  temperature,  fan  speed,  compressor  speed  and  direction  of  air  flow  of  the  unit  to  save  energy  as  well  as  providing  comfort  to  the  users.  in  buildings  that  require  all  the
__label__environmentmonitoring air  conditioners  to  be  networked  for  central  monitoring  and  control  purposes,  a  proprietary  or  standard  communication  protocol  are  used  to  network  all  of  the  equipment  together.  usually  a  separate  communication  module  or  a  special  control  board  is  required  to  be  used  on  each  unit  for  networking  purpose.  these  controls  are  not  connected  to  the  outside  world  and  an  integrated  master  control  panel  may  be  used  to  control  the  air  conditioners,  lighting,  fire  alarm  and  security  systems  from  a  central  location.  internet  of  things  the  iot  have  made  use  of  the  advancement  in  information  and  communications  technologies  where  the  flow  of
__label__environmentmonitoring information  in  a  secure  environment  have  enabled  them  to  change  the  ways  hvacr  are  being  controlled.  here  are  some  of  the  advantages  of  using  internet  of  things  in  heating,  ventilation,  air  conditioning  and  refrigeration.  1.  internet  connectivity  these  devices  in  the  equipment  are  not  only  connected  to  each  other  but  are  also  connected  to  the  outside  world  through  internet  connectivity.  this  means  that  as  long  as  there  is  an  internet  connection  with  enough  bandwidth  anywhere  in  the  world,  you  will  be  able  to  access  each  equipment  not  only  to  see  how  it  is  doing  but  also  to  control  it  remotely
__label__environmentmonitoring and  in  real  time.  2.  analysis  of  data  for  better  performance  the  analysis  of  data  gathered  from  the  equipment  coupled  with  other  prevailing  data  such  as  the  weather  forecast,  holidays  of  the  year  and  number  of  occupants  will  enable  the  system  to  make  better  decision.  this  will  ensure  optimum  settings  are  being  used  to  achieve  the  highest  operating  efficiency.  the  settings  of  the  system  will  be  able  to  change  continuously  without  any  assistance  from  the  users  if  possible.this  is  a  simple  artificial  intelligence  at  work.  better  efficiency  will  translate  to  savings  in  electricity  hence  lower  operating  bills.  typical  savings  can

__label__environmentmonitoring adding  the  internet  of  things  iot  increases  the  efficiency  of  the  entire  system  by  allowing  users  to  automatically  monitor  and  control  a  wide  range  of  variables.  although  users  have  been  using  devices  such  as  the  to  manage  the  heating  and  cooling,  iot  has  a  much  bigger  potential.  the  have  a  way  of  learning  the  temperature  the  occupant  prefers  at  different  times,  and  even  adjust  the  system  to  suit  the  desired  levels.  the  iot,  on  the  other  hand,  increases  the  range  of  variables  to  monitor  as  well  as  the  control  which  can  now  be  done  over  the  internet.  at  the  moment,
__label__environmentmonitoring demand  for  the  iot  and  smart  technologies  in  the  hvac  industry  is  increasing  due  to  their  potential  to  increase  the  energy  efficiency,  reduce  costs  and  improve  comfort.  adding  iot  involves  the  use  of  different  wireless  sensors,  smart  vents  with  the  ability  to  control  each  room  independently,  and  other  technologies  that  add  intelligence  to  the  hvac  system  and  its  components.  different  kinds  of  sensors  are  integrated  into  the  hvac  system  to  monitor  a  wide  range  of  variables  and  provide  realtime  status  of  almost  all  the  components.  image  blueapp.io  the  hvac  iot  sensor  data  is  fed  to  the  control  system  which  then
__label__environmentmonitoring sends  commands  to  automatically  turn  the  system  on  or  off,  or  perform  other  functions.  the  other  control  functions  include  changing  the  temperature,  speed  of  airflow,  closing  or  opening  vents,  or  adjusting  other  conditions  to  suit  a  users  preference.  monitoring  the  hvac  components  and  the  environment  provides  data  which  can  be  used  for  planning  purposes  as  well  as  determining  how  people  are  using  the  services  in  the  building.  this  includes  variables  such  as  temperature,  water  usage,  lighting,  occupancy  levels,  etc.  and  the  data  can  be  displayed  and  accessed  using  computers,  tablets,  smartphones  or  centralized  control  panels.  most  importantly,  the  sensor  data
__label__environmentmonitoring enables  the  relevant  hvac  components  to  automatically  adjust  themselves  based  on  the  time  of  the  day,  temperature,  occupancy,  weather  or  any  other  variable  as  per  the  program.  in  addition,  the  sensors  provide  a  means  of  continuous  monitoring  of  the  system  status  as  well  as  realtime  diagnostics  for  routine  maintenance  and  repairs.  once  the  sensors  detect  a  potential  problem,  they  can  then  send  an  alert  to  the  technicians  or  maintenance  personnel,  hence  ensuring  immediate  mitigation  and  prevention  of  major  breakdowns.  most  of  the  modern  smart  hvac  come  with  their  own  sensors.  but  the  older  systems  require  adding  and  configuring  the  sensors
__label__environmentmonitoring to  create  the  preferred  management  or  control.  the  consumption  of  the  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  hvac  equipment  forms  a  big  portion  of  a  home  or  businesss  overall  energy  consumption.  this  is  especially  so  for  the  older  systems  which  are  not  only  inefficient  but  relies  mostly  on  manual  controls.  modern  technologies  such  as  thermostats  and  automatic  controls  have  greatly  increased  the  way  the  equipment  operates  and  adjusts  itself.  however,  using  smart  and  internet  of  things  technologies  can  make  the  hvac  systems  more  intelligent.  adding  intelligence  to  the  heating  and  cooling  of  the  spaces  helps  in  addressing  issues  that  the  traditional
__label__environmentmonitoring hvac  equipment  cannot.  the  monitoring  and  automation  ensure  that  the  components  such  as  heaters  and  compressors  only  run  when  there  is  a  need.  the  iot  has  the  potential  to  improve  several  aspects  of  the  hvac  equipment  and  systems.  in  addition  to  increasing  the  control,  efficiency,  and  comfort,  iot  improves  the  hvac  contractors  processes  such  as  monitoring,  planning  and  carrying  routine  maintenance  and  repairs.  smart  thermostats  include  a  variety  of  sensors  which  can  read  the  occupancy,  humidity,  temperature  and  other  variables,  hence  determine  the  state  of  the  room  or  space  and  make  the  necessary  adjustments.  todays  technology  makes  it  possible  to
__label__environmentmonitoring monitor  almost  all  aspects  of  hvac  equipment  including  the  ductwork,  room  occupancy,  and  temperature  as  well  as  conditions  external  to  the  building.  for  example,  placing  the  appropriate  sensors  in  the  ducts,  it  is  possible  to  measure  parameters  such  as  the  temperature,  static  pressure  and  the  airflow.  generally,  the  hvac  systems  provide  a  onetemperaturefitsall  approach  to  address  the  heating  as  well  as  cooling  needs.  the  air,  from  a  central  heating  and  cooling  device,  is  piped  throughout  the  area  the  hvac  is  serving.  in  traditional  hvac  systems,  controlling  the  temperature  in  each  room  requires  manual  opening  or  closing  of  the  vents  in
__label__environmentmonitoring each  of  the  rooms.  this  is  cumbersome  and  has  the  probability  of  wasting  energy.  however,  automating  the  system  to  make  smart  hvac  vents  can  make  it  more  efficient  and  comfortable.  the  smart  solutions  enable  the  vents  to  open  dynamically  depending  on  the  status  of  the  existing  and  preferred  conditions  of  the  room.  for  example,  adding  the  temperature,  motion,  and  proximity  sensors  on  the  vents  allows  them  to  monitor  the  conditions  and  determine  which  rooms  are  in  use.  in  case  there  is  a  need  to  change  the  temperature,  the  motorized  vent  automatically  opens  or  closes,  hence  redirecting  the  air  according  to
__label__environmentmonitoring the  users  preferences  or  asset  in  the  program.  iot  is  already  helping  with  equipment  maintenance  in  a  variety  of  industries  and  applications.  using  sensors,  engineers  can  monitor  the  conditions  of  the  various  electrical  and  mechanical  components  of  the  systems.  analyzing  the  data  allows  them  to  know  when  a  piece  of  equipment  is  about  to  fail  or  whether  there  is  a  need  for  repair  or  maintenance.  when  in  operation,  the  mechanical  systems  produce  specific  sounds.  engineers  may  use  ultrasonic  and  vibration  sensors  to  determine  the  state  of  the  mechanical  components  in  the  hvac  system.  by  comparing  the  data  from  the  sensors
__label__environmentmonitoring with  that  from  similar  machines  that  are  working  properly,  engineers  are  able  to  see  if  there  are  discrepancies  which  may  be  signs  of  maintenance  issues  or  faults.  iot  enables  the  engineers  or  facility  managers  to  monitor  and  access  the  status  of  the  hvac  systems  in  realtime.  since  this  is  available  on  the  smartphones  and  other  internetenabled  technologies,  the  engineers  can  get  status  reports  anytime.  this  allows  them  to  make  better  and  accurate  maintenance  decisions.  integrating  the  smart  and  automated  hvac  systems  with  appropriate  platforms  gives  the  users,  facility  managers  or  technicians  a  single  point  of  access,  monitoring,  and  control.  additionally,
__label__environmentmonitoring the  smart  features  may  allow  the  system  to  send  reminders  for  routine  maintenance,  service  checkups,  filter  replacements,  etc.  hvac  with  iot  means  better  energy  efficiency,  management,  maintenance,  connectedness,  serviceability  and  reduced  downtime  for  the  whole  system  and  its  components.  the  benefits  of  iot  in  hvac  systems  include;  security  flaws  are  still  a  major  concern  for  most  users  and  professionals.  some  consumers  fear  that  hackers  can  access  some  iot  sensors  through  the  internet,  and  comprise  the  operation  of  devices  as  well  their  privacy  and  security.  other  challenges  include  the  incompatibility  between  various  components  and  some  hvac  professionals  who  fear  that  the

__label__environmentmonitoring lg  electronics  is  embracing  artificial  intelligence  across  all  of  its  business  units,  from  hvac  and  home  appliances  to  consumer  electronics  and  mobile  communications.  in  addition  to  being  more  efficient,  new  chiller  models  require  less  maintenance  and  provide  better  connectivity  and  easier  access  to  data.  for  the  last  several  years,  experts  have  claimed  that  the  iot  would  lead  to  a  revolutionary  change  in  the  way  we  live,  as  the  billions  of  devices  we  use  would  be  able  to  communicate  with  one  another  to  make  our  lives  better.  that  prediction  is  coming  true,  particularly  where  commercial  hvac  equipment  is  concerned,  as  manufacturers
__label__environmentmonitoring are  investing  in  iotenabled  systems  that  can  be  custom  designed  to  meet  the  needs  of  both  end  users  and  contractors.  keep  in  mind  were  still  at  the  cusp  of  truly  realizing  the  benefits  it  the  iot  has  for  commercial  hvac,  in  terms  of  both  performance  and  comfort,  said  sudhi  sinha,  vice  president  and  general  manager  of  dataenabled  business,  johnson  controls  inc.  the  possibilities  are  truly  endless,  so  its  all  about  how  we  embrace  new  technologies  and  continue  to  invest  in  innovation.  the  ability  for  commercial  oems  to  invest  in  iot  innovation  has  become  much  easier,  thanks  to  more  affordable  edge
__label__environmentmonitoring computing  devices  and  smaller  processing  units,  which  allow  improved  access  to  smart,  local  control  options  for  hvac  devices  and  systems,  explained  sinha.  combine  that  with  the  increased  use  of  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence,  and  were  now  looking  at  much  better  automation  and  comprehensive  management  of  hvac  systems,  he  said.  controllers  utilized  by  commercial  oems  are  also  becoming  more  powerful,  enabling  more  sophisticated  control  algorithms,  edge  computing  with  performance  analytics,  and  the  ability  to  easily  connect  to  existing  it  networks,  which  facilitates  secure  data  exchange  with  the  cloud,  according  to  carl  barnard,  director  of  controls  sales,  lg  air  conditioning  technologies.
__label__environmentmonitoring these  trends  not  only  have  the  potential  to  positively  impact  energy  use,  comfort,  and  operational  costs  of  our  built  environment,  but  impact  design,  procurement,  and  many  other  aspects  of  our  industry,  barnard  said.  as  a  result,  building  owners  and  managers  are  warming  to  the  iot  trend,  expressing  a  greater  interest  in  mobile  connectivity  and  diagnostics.  what  customers  want,  explained  rosa  leal,  senior  product  manager  of  commercial  products,  rheem  air  division,  is  more  visibility  to  detect  problems  earlier  on  to  avoid  downtime,  as  well  as  better  monitor  energy  utilization  and  savings.  the  iot  provides  value  and  protection  for  both  the  contractor
__label__environmentmonitoring and  the  end  user  by  allowing  technology  to  communicate  realtime  data  and  help  extend  the  life  of  their  investment,  such  as  scheduling,  service  and  maintenance  alerts,  energy  usage  reports,  etc.,  said  leal.  it  is  no  wonder  that  there  is  an  increased  appetite  for  analytics  that  illustrate  how  equipment  is  performing,  as  40  percent  of  a  buildings  energy  expenses  are  tied  to  hvac  operations,  noted  paul  rauker,  vice  president  and  general  manager  intelligent  solutions,  daikin  applied.  technicians  and  building  managers  are  analyzing  data  for  better  efficiency,  and  they  are  seeing  the  value  in  connecting  standalone  equipment  to  or  within  an  ecosystem,
__label__environmentmonitoring to  cloudbased  control  solutions  for  these  insights,  said  rauker.  building  owners  and  managers  are  starting  to  understand  this,  too.  as  they  become  more  educated  about  the  benefits  of  the  iot,  including  the  increased  capabilities  and  return  on  investment,  they  become  more  likely  to  adopt  iotenabled  equipment,  he  said.  this  benefits  the  industry  overall,  because  it  helps  drive  down  price  points  and  make  advanced  technology  more  affordable  for  small  and  midmarket  businesses,  rauker  added.  the  iot  is  the  most  exciting  technology  in  the  commercial  hvac  arena  today,  especially  considering  how  it  will  be  used  is  still  being  defined,  said  dan  moffroid,
__label__environmentmonitoring director  of  product  management,  bosch  thermotechnology.  the  most  pertinent  advantages  today  relate  to  remote  system  monitoring  and  control  to  help  prevent  failures  and  avoid  downtime,  he  said.  but  other  changes  in  this  field  are  still  in  the  early  stages,  such  as  integration  with  other  equipment  inside  and  outside  of  the  building  envelope,  the  business  model  of  delivering  commissioning  and  maintenance  services,  etc.  indeed,  that  ability  to  integrate  data  from  many  different  building  systems  and  equipment  is  one  of  the  biggest  promises  of  the  iot.  in  the  past,  data  was  typically  siloed,  noted  barnard,  but  now,  end  users  are  likely  to
__label__environmentmonitoring experience  lower  operational  costs,  improved  competitiveness,  and  better  key  performance  integrators  kpis  relative  to  their  business.  contractors  and  service  providers  will  likewise  benefit  from  having  continuous  eyes  on  iotenabled  equipment,  better  preventative  maintenance  programs,  and  integrated  ticketing  systems,  he  said.  in  addition  to  gathering  data,  end  users  are  looking  for  iot  technology  to  help  interpret  it  and  provide  actionable  insights.  as  sinha  noted,  its  no  longer  enough  to  simply  provide  raw  data;  it  must  be  analyzed  to  provide  meaning  and  direction  that  can  guide  hvac  maintenance  decisions.  building  owners  also  want  to  use  this  data  to  create  customized  solutions.  end
__label__environmentmonitoring users  want  to  use  iot  technology  to  create  personalized,  interactive  experiences  for  occupants,  including  having  hvac  systems  that  respond  intelligently  to  the  presence  of  people  or  the  swipe  of  a  badge,  as  well  as  other  building  objects  like  lights,  window  shades,  door  locks,  and  elevators,  sinha  said.  and  they  want  all  this  data  to  be  presented  in  the  same  easytouse,  simple  format  that  they  get  from  other  connected  devices,  said  michael  hoppe,  senior  product  manager  of  intelligent  equipment,  daikin  applied.  based  on  this  demand  for  simplicity,  daikin  applied  designed  its  iot  solutions,  which  include  the  intelligent  equipment  line  of  chillers,

__label__environmentmonitoring forward.  as  leal  noted,  the  iot  will  continue  to  bring  more  customizable  solutions  to  the  commercial  air  and  water  heater  space,  making  it  easier  to  save  money,  reduce  downtime,  and  optimize  performance.  sinha  agreed,  adding  that  future  systems  will  be  designed  with  customization  and  connectivity  in  mind.  in  addition,  the  iot  will  open  up  new  ways  to  use  data  and  hvac  systems.  for  example,  now  we  can  apply  model  predictive  controls  and  reinforcement  learning  to  optimize  how  to  best  run  central  plants  based  on  factors  such  as  the  design  of  the  plant  equipment  and  its  optimal  performance  zones,  occupancy,  emerging
__label__environmentmonitoring weather  patterns,  changing  utility  rates,  access  to  energy  storage,  and  applicable  facility  constraints,  he  said.  the  theoretical  underpinning  for  this  has  existed  for  a  long  time,  but  new  iot  technologies  are  enabling  this  type  of  advanced  usage.  being  able  to  analyze  the  performance  of  hvac  equipment  in  actual  usage  conditions  through  the  use  of  iot  technology  will  also  help  manufacturers  improve  equipment  design  and  provide  additional  services,  said  rauker.  the  way  hvac  equipment  functions  varies  by  application  within  various  vertical  markets  e.g.,  office  buildings,  hospitals,  and  this  level  of  detailed  insight  makes  us  smarter  about  our  offerings,  he  said.  using

__label__environmentmonitoring how  do  we  take  smart  building  concepts  one  step  further?  a  smart  building  uses  a  combination  of  multiple  technologies,  automated  controls  and  decisionsupporting  software  that  provides  a  rapid  and  responsive  environment.  frequently,  they  help  in  enhancing  the  efficiency  and  operational  effectiveness  of  building  systems  like  hvac,  while  also  increasing  reliability  and  robustness.  reduced  energy  consumption  and  greater  operational  efficiencies  often  result.  smart  buildings  can  achieve  all  this  and  more  with  the  help  of  sensors.  sensors  in  combination  with  robust  cloud  software  platforms  help  communicate,  manage,  automate  and  control  the  systems  remotely  24/7/365.  this  is  where  the  the  internet  of  things
__label__environmentmonitoring iot  can  mobilize  advanced  technologies  to  monitor  various  environmental  measures  such  as  temperature,  humidity,  light  and  motion,  to  analyze  the  operational  efficiency  of  building  systems,  and  to  optimize  facility  operations  using  data  intelligence  gathered  in  realtime.  an  market  report  expects  the  smart  building  market  to  grow  from  an  estimated  usd  7.42  billion  in  2017  to  usd  31.74  billion  by  2022,  at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  cagr  of  33.7  from  2017  to  2022.  it  is  a  wellknown  fact  that  buildings  consume  about  40  of  the  energy  consumption  in  the  world.  out  of  this  total  consumption,  hvac  systems  represent  the  largest
__label__environmentmonitoring consumer  class.  this  comes  as  no  surprise  because  hvac  systems  perform  one  of  the  most  essential  functions  of  delivering  comfort  to  building  occupants.  a  missioncritical  function  to  be  sure.  the  amount  of  energy  that  hvac  systems  consume  depends  on  many  factors.  the  building  location,  climate,  temperatures  during  the  day  and  night,  room  occupancy,  building  age,  windows  and  insulation,  and  so  on,  can  drastically  change  the  heating/cooling  demands  placed  on  the  hvac  system.  automation  and  control  of  hvac  systems  has  become  a  complex  task;  high  levels  of  energy  efficiency  can  result  if  done  correctly.  the  illustration  below  shows  how  iot  works.
__label__environmentmonitoring led  retrofits  have  become  popular  to  achieve  greater  energy  efficiency  in  buildings.  this  lowhanging  fruit  has  been  relatively  easy  to  capture  due  to  the  predictable  roi  models  obtained  through  quantifiable  replacement  and  operating  costs.  hvac  represents  a  much  larger  energyefficiency  opportunity  in  buildings,  but  suffers  because  of  the  high  complexity  surrounding  such  an  exercise.  hvac  is  the  next,  great  frontier  of  achieving  energy  savings  in  buildings.  applying  smart  building  technology  to  hvac  systems  has  vast  potential  in  the  enterprise.  technologies  such  as  iot  can  help  you  meet  your  current  and  future  energy  goals  by  giving  the  needed  tools  to  take
__label__environmentmonitoring on  such  a  task.  below,  we  take  a  look  at  different  ways  smart  building  technology  can  give  you  the  critical  edge  in  gaining  maximum  impact  from  your  hvac  systems.  smart  buildings  can  incorporate  a  variety  of  communication  technologies  that  enable  integration  with  various  hvac  systems  in  a  building.  available  energy  efficiency  opportunities  will  depend  on  the  current  hvac  infrastructure  installed  within  the  building.  iot  devices  can  interface  with  standalone  thermostats  using  standardized  protocols  such  as  bacnet  and  modbus,  and  can  present  a  cloudinterface  for  management  and  control  of  that  thermostat.  iot  brings  remote  visibility  to  disconnected  hvac  subsystems.  in  a
__label__environmentmonitoring simple  example,  iot  devices  can  interface  with  standalone  thermostats  using  standardized  protocols  such  as  bacnet  and  modbus,  and  can  present  a  cloudinterface  for  management  and  control  of  that  thermostat.  this  effectively  creates  a  type  of  virtual  bas.  this  example  use  case  provides  large  energy  savings  opportunities  in  defined  hvac  zones  such  as  small  retail  spaces,  construction  or  educational  trailers,  individual  tenant  spaces,  or  any  commercial  or  industrial  space  featuring  limited  smart  building  functionality.  iot  can  enable  retrofit  applications  that  target  specific  needs  with  surgical  precision.  small,  targeted  iot  installations  can  produce  outsized  energy  savings  in  facilities  starved  for  technology.  advanced
__label__environmentmonitoring sensor  integration:  even  the  most  advanced  bas  has  access  to  limited  sensor  data  such  as  temperature  and  humidity.  the  automated  hvac  control  loops  programmed  therein  are  limited  to  the  available  sensor  data  set.  smart  hvac  systems  will  increasingly  incorporate  additional  sensor  data  to  deliver  maximum  comfort  to  building  occupants.  is  your  office  too  hot  or  too  cold?  the  fact  that  most  would  agree  points  to  the  insufficiency  of  the  temperature  data  available  to  the  hvac  system.  most  heating/cooling  zones  dont  have  enough  temperature  sensors.  the  limited  temperature  data  they  do  have  provides  only  a  coarse  level  of  temperature  control.  additional
__label__environmentmonitoring temperatures  sensors  that  cover  the  entire  heating/cooling  zone  will  provide  finegrained  temperature  controls.  this  example  of  finegrained  temperature  controls  has  arisen  because  of  the  need  for  better  data  in  the  hvac  control  loop.  dont  get  put  off  by  the  emphasis  on  tenant  comfort.  this  example  points  to  the  current  overhaul  of  the  traditional  model  of  hvac  infrastructure.  additional  data  based  on  weather  forecasts,  occupancy  schedules,  personal  occupant  preferences,  indoor  air  quality  iaq,  or  any  additional  comfort  factor,  can  be  aggregated  in  the  cloud  to  provide  advanced  hvac  controls  that  leverage  iot.  unit  efficiency:  hvac  systems  include  various  components.  as  noted,
__label__environmentmonitoring 39  of  the  buildings  energy  consumption  is  consumed  by  hvac.  this  consumption  can  be  further  broken  down  into  individual  hvac  system  components.  sadly,  most  organizations  have  little  to  no  visibility  into  critical  hvac  assets  such  as  chillers,  cooling  towers  and  roof  top  units  rtus.  even  if  the  hvac  system  is  controlled  by  a  modern  bas,  limited  insight  is  available  to  individual  hvac  unit  efficiencies.  certainly,  critical  hvac  assets  that  operate  outside  of  manufacturers  specifications  will  have  poor  energy  efficiency.  iot  can  capture  granular  data  from  critical  hvac  assets  in  a  building.  for  example,  inexpensive  wireless  iot  sensors  can  capture  realtime
__label__environmentmonitoring operational  data  regarding  supply/return  temperatures,  fan  speeds,  vibration,  flow  rates,  compressor  run  times,  pressure,  total  asset  energy  consumption,  etc.  the  realtime  capture  of  assetspecific  data  will  enable  insights  into  the  true  operational  efficiency  of  critical  hvac  assets.  energy  efficiencies  will  follow  naturally  when  unit  inefficiencies  are  corrected  with  modern,  realtime  asset  condition  monitoring  acm.  hvac  systems  generally  have  regular  maintenance  schedules  since  they  form  the  heart  of  any  building.  this  includes  general  checkups,  service  and  maintenance  at  predetermined  time  periods  and  frequency.  what  happens,  however,  when  a  fault  occurs  inbetween  maintenance  checks?  further,  what  happens  when  a  visual  inspection  does
__label__environmentmonitoring not  reveal  the  existence  or  potential  occurrence  of  a  catastrophic  fault?  as  we  all  know,  minor  issues  will  grow  into  major  issues.  smart  building  technology  that  provides  realtime  visibility  into  the  operational  condition  of  critical  hvac  assets  provides  the  best  solution  for  early  fault  detection  and  diagnostics  fdd  and  predictive  maintenance.  wouldnt  you  like  to  know  that  your  cooling  tower  was  performing  outside  of  the  normal  specifications  established  over  the  last  60  days?  the  potential  for  catastrophic  failure  could  implicate  costly  emergency  repairs  and  severe  compromise  of  tenant  operations.  concerns  over  energy  efficiency  will  seem  minor  when  these  issues  arise.
__label__environmentmonitoring the  aggregation  of  realtime  data  from  critical  hvac  assets  using  iot  will  enable  artificial  intelligence  ai.  ai  can  be  used  for  advanced  analytics  that  identify  potential  problems  before  they  manifest.  in  many  cases,  simple  hvac  analytics  will  be  sufficient.  realtime  alerts  and  notifications  can  be  programmed  to  signal  warning  conditions.  for  example,  you  can  program  alerts  and  notifications  when  the  rtu  airflow  is  compromised  or  vibration  levels  exceed  programmable  thresholds.  these  alerts  can  enable  timely  maintenance  action  to  prevent  catastrophic  failures.  the  key  here  is  access  to  realtime  data  that  assesses  the  ongoing  operational  status  of  critical  hvac  assets.  realtime

__label__environmentmonitoring add  the  following  snippet  to  your  html:  monitors  the  fan  speed,  on/off  cycles,  temperature,  and  humidity  of  my  hvac  system  and  posts  data  to  thingspeak.com.  read  up  about  this  project  on  monitors  the  fan  speed,  on/off  cycles,  temperature,  and  humidity  of  my  hvac  system  and  posts  data  to  thingspeak.com.  i  built  this  project  for  two  reasons.  1  ive  been  looking  for  an  excuse  to  play  around  with  iot,  and  with  the  esp8266  in  particular.  2  my  electric  bill  has  been  steadily  increasing  and  i  wanted  to  see  how  often  my  hvac  system  was  cycling  on  and  off  and  at  what
__label__environmentmonitoring temperature.  i  figured  i  could  monitor  on/off  cycles  by  attaching  a  small  dc  fan  motor  to  the  return  air  grill.  when  the  hvac  unit  turns  on,  the  airflow  will  cause  the  fan  to  turn;  acting  as  a  generator.  i  can  then  read  the  voltage  generated  by  the  fan  motor  by  connecting  it  to  an  analog  input  pin  on  the  esp8266.  i  thought  i  might  also  be  able  to  determine  the  fan  speed  by  the  variation  of  the  voltage  generated.  and  i  might  as  well  measure  the  temperature  and  humidity  while  im  at  it.  i  had  an  old,  nonworking  power  supply
__label__environmentmonitoring from  a  dell  pc  in  my  junk  box,  so  i  decided  to  salvage  the  fan  for  this  project.  i  hot  glued  magnets  on  the  four  corners  of  the  fan,  so  i  could  easily  attach  it  to  and  detach  it  from  the  metal  return  air  grill.  for  my  processor,  i  chose  the  sparkfun  esp8266  thing  because  it  includes  a  builtin  lipo  charging  circuit.  i  mounted  the  thing  to  the  fan  using  hot  glue  and  a  small  breadboard.  then,  i  wired  up  the  fan  to  the  adc  analog  pin  and  gnd.  i  also  added  a  1k  pull  down  resistor  to  make  sure
__label__environmentmonitoring the  analog  pin  read  zero  volts  when  the  hvac  unit  was  off.  i  glued  a  lipo  battery  to  the  fan  as  well  and  plugged  it  into  the  thing.  i  connected  the  dht11  to  the  scl  pin  which  also  serves  as  digital  i/o  pin  14  to  read  temperature  and  humidity.  once  i  put  everything  together  and  uploaded  my  sketch,  i  snapped  the  device  to  my  return  air  grill  and  kicked  on  the  a/c.  as  you  can  see,  the  on/off  cycles  look  nice  and  symmetrical,  but  my  voltage  readings  jump  around  a  lot.  i  probably  need  to  clean  that  up  a  bit
__label__environmentmonitoring with  a  rectifier  or  some  such.  the  temperature  and  humidity  readings  give  me  a  good  idea  of  when  its  cycling.  all  i  have  to  do  now  is  find  out  how  often  a  normal  a/c  unit  should  cycle  and  ill  be  good  to  go
__label__environmentmonitoring iot  is  meant  to  move  us  from  the  world  of  isolated  systems  into  one  where  devices,  equipped  with  various  sensors,  are  interconnected  and  exchanging  data  with  each  other.  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  is  among  industries  standing  to  be  profoundly  transformed  by  the  fastevolving  internet  of  things  technologies.  embedding  intelligence  and  connectivity  into  devices  enables  manufacturers  to  make  better  use  of  their  assets,  launch  modernized  offerings,  and  build  new  business  models.  for  clients,  the  advent  of  the  iot  brings  greater  degrees  of  comfort,  more  functionality,  and  reduced  energy  bills.  in  this  post,  well  discuss  the  current  role  of  iot  in
__label__environmentmonitoring hvac  and  explain  exactly  what  aspects  of  the  150yearold  industry  this  trendy  tech  is  poised  to  change.  iot  is  growing  frenetically.  ,  theres  going  to  be  20,4  billion  connected  devices  used  in  the  world  by  2020  and  some  hvac  vendors,  such  as  industry  titans  honeywell,  johnson  controls,  daikin  applied,  seem  very  keen  on  riding  this  trend.  the  key  benefits  the  iot  brings  to  the  energy  sector  are  the  operational  visibility  into  hvac  appliances  and  ways  to  reduce,  by  a  large  margin,  energy  consumption.  by  integrating  smart  devices  with  motion  sensors,  for  example,  hvac  contractors  can  get  their  devices  to  continuously
__label__environmentmonitoring monitor  occupancy  within  the  building.  when  no  movement  is  detected  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time,  the  system  can  suggest,  though  an  app  notification,  to  turn  heating  or  cooling  down  to  lower  the  power  usage.  the  controls  can  also  employ  the  latest  networking  and  ai  technologies  and  thus  be  capable  of  learning  the  tenants  preferences  and  adjusting  to  their  comfort  needs  automatically  over  time.  thirdparty  data  sources,  such  as  weather  feeds,  can  be  incorporated  as  well;  the  system,  expecting  a  rapid  temperature  surge,  can  start  gradually  cooling  the  building  down  to  sustain  the  tenants  comfort.  it  can  prepare  for  the
__label__environmentmonitoring future  in  the  most  energyefficient  way.  the  elements  of  typical  iotenabled  hvac  infrastructure  include:  a  properly  designed  iotenabled  hvac  system  allows  for  seamless  data  accumulation,  filtering,  and  sharing;  the  equipment  is  connected  to  the  analytics  platform  in  the  cloud  directly,  which  enables  preventive  maintenance  and  continuous  optimization.  seeing  a  certain  parts  decreasing  performance,  for  instance,  experts  can  figure  out  its  maintenance  needs  ahead  of  time  and  fix  the  device  before  it  breaks  down  thus  preventing  costly  repairs.  the  software  is  usually  set  up  to  generate  dynamic  alerts  upon  spotting  abnormal  behavior,  such  as  power  consumption  that  exceeds  the  baseline  upper
__label__environmentmonitoring bound  defined  by  the  system  managers.  although  the  wont  be  able  to  fix  the  issues  themselves,  their  dynamic  notifications  can  bring  forward  routine  onsite  checks  and  thus  ensure  no  catastrophic  failures  ever  happen.  hvac  providers,  who  have  switched  to  a  proactive  mode,  will  find  the  lifespans  of  their  hardware  substantially  increased.  as  far  as  optimization  goes,  the  platform,  embedded  with  intelligence,  can  figure  out  the  most  energy  efficient  configurations  automatically.  this  means  the  controls  will  optimize  parameters  such  as  fan  and  pump  management  thresholds,  water  temperature  set  point,  scheduling,  etc.  and  quantify  the  benefits  of  various  configurations  in  terms  of
__label__environmentmonitoring energy  usage.  besides  that,  connected  hvac  platforms  can  give  the  users  direct  access  to  the  power  consumption  and  carbon  dioxide  emissions  stats;  theyll  provide  deep  insight  into  what  kind  of  a  carbon  footprint  buildings  leave  behind.  suppose  a  clients  connected  platform  is  set  to  turn  on  air  conditioning  at  5  pm  the  homeowner  usually  comes  back  at  7  pm,  and  it  takes  about  two  hours  to  achieve  the  most  comfortable  temperature  conditions.  however,  one  day  an  urgent  meeting  occurs,  and  the  tenant  cant  make  it  home  till  9  pm.  if  the  data  from  google  calendar  and  google  maps  is  incorporated
__label__environmentmonitoring into  the  hvac  infrastructure,  the  system  will  recognize  the  scheduled  meeting,  take  into  account  expected  traffic  conditions,  and  postpone  the  devices  activation  till,  say,  7.30  in  the  evening.  for  people  with  flexible  work  schedules,  the  connected  platforms  can  save  them  lots  of  money.  seeing  large  organizations  throw  their  hats  into  the  iot  ring  has  inspired  multiple  smaller  hvac  manufacturers  to  follow  suit.  they,  too,  aim  to  employ  the  latest  tech  to  reinvent  their  business  models  and  go  from  simply  selling  and  deploying  hvac  devices  and  fixing  the  broken  appliances  to  offering  predictive  maintenance  and  other  highlevel  hvac  services  around  them.

__label__environmentmonitoring range  of  technology  platforms  and  communication  paths.  the  members  of  the  eebus  association  define  what  these  use  cases  look  like  and  specify  how  they  are  supposed  to  work.  they  then  validate  the  use  cases  in  so  called  plug  fests.  these  are  events  that  bring  together  members  of  the  ebbus  association  in  order  to  test  the  specification  under  live  conditions.  in  other  words,  the  plug  fests  are  used  as  proof  points  to  ensure  interoperability  between  the  devices  of  different  vendors.  overall,  this  approach  of  defining  and  then  validating  ensures  that  the  use  cases  are  fully  ready  when  companies  want  to  implement
__label__environmentmonitoring them  in  iot  deployments.  as  the  various  use  cases  show,  the  standard  defined  by  eebus  is  mainly  geared  toward  the  energy  and  smart  home  markets.  at  present,  implementation  of  this  standard  is  focusing  on  four  fields:  emobility,  hvac,  white  goods,  and  the  power  grid.inverter  integration,  extended  battery  management  and  more  are  to  come.  generally  speaking,  the  focus  of  the  different  use  cases  lies  on  monitoring  and  configuring  different  systems  as  well  as  energy  management.  the  rise  of  emobility  is  leading  to  changes  in  not  only  the  automotive  industry  but  also  the  energy  sector.  in  the  future,  the  question  of  how
__label__environmentmonitoring best  to  manage  the  recharging  of  electric  vehicles  will  become  a  key  issue.  eebus  has  therefore  defined  a  couple  of  use  cases  in  regard  to  emobility.  a  simple  one  concerns  overload  protection.  charging  an  electric  vehicle  draws  substantial  power.  this  can  become  a  problem  when  a  lot  of  other  devices  are  using  electricity  at  the  same  time.  to  avoid  overloading  the  system  and  blowing  fuses,  the  power  used  for  charging  an  electric  vehicle  can  be  automatically  reduced,  if  need  be.  eebus  also  describes  a  way  of  increasing  efficiency  by  intelligently  managing  the  charging  process.  say  you  use  a  photovoltaic  system
__label__environmentmonitoring to  generate  your  own  electricity.  in  this  case,  you  will  likely  want  to  use  this  power  to  charge  your  vehicle,  rather  than  drawing  it  from  the  public  grid.  this  is  something  a  connected  system  based  on  the  ebbus  standard  could  enable.  it  would  thereby  give  preference  to  the  power  generated  by  your  photovoltaic  system  for  charging  your  car.  eebus  can  also  come  into  play  when  drawing  electricity  from  the  public  grid.  in  this  scenario,  the  recharging  process  can  be  coordinated  with  the  energy  provider.  on  the  one  hand,  the  energy  provider  can  react  to  any  signs  of  overloading.  on  the
__label__environmentmonitoring other  hand,  car  owners  can  opt  to  recharge  at  offpeak  times,  saving  money  in  the  process.  heating,  ventilation,  and  airconditioning  systems  often  draw  a  lot  of  power.  in  other  words,  smart  management  of  their  power  consumption  makes  a  lot  of  sense.  for  starters,  a  system  based  on  the  eebus  standard  would  enable  various  monitoring  use  cases.  for  example,  it  would  be  possible  to  keep  an  eye  on  system  functions  and  power  consumption.  you  can  also  monitor  temperatures  room  temperature,  for  instance.  using  this  information,  it  would  then  be  possible  to  make  adjustments  again  based  on  standardized  use  cases  provided  by

__label__environmentmonitoring can  also  be  used  for  white  goods.  for  example,  a  dishwasher  could  be  set  to  start  at  times  when  the  power  grid  is  less  heavily  utilized,  thereby  leading  to  reduced  costs.  in  addition  to  this  timebased  approach,  there  is  also  the  option  of  direct  control.  in  the  event  of  grid  issues,  the  utility  company  could  ask  your  energy  manager  at  home  to  increase  or  decrease  energy  consumption.  the  energy  manager  at  home  would  then  influence  the  energy  consumption  of,  say,  the  fridge  or  freezer  by  increasing  or  decreasing  temperature  within  a  given  bandwidth.  in  this  way,  load  peaks  could  be

__label__environmentmonitoring make  the  selection  process  significantly  more  straightforward.  with  that  said,  lets  dive  in  having  answers  to  the  following  questions  will  help  define  what  sensor  hardware  is  right  for  your  solution  today,  and  into  the  future.  today,  wireless  sensors  and  devices  exist  to  collect  nearly  any  desired  physical  or  environmental  data  points.  however,  in  a  wireless  edge  network,  all  devices  need  to  be  protocol  interoperable  at  the  gateway  level.  with  the  rigado  cascade  iot  gateway  that  means  devices  that  support  bluetooth  standard  protocols  and  custom  profiles,  wirepas  mesh,  zigbee  and  thread,  wifi,  ethernet  tcp/ip,  or  usb  2.0.  its  important  to  keep
__label__environmentmonitoring in  mind  that  technology  and  protocols,  particularly  in  the  iot  space,  are  iterated  upon  and  improved  at  a  rapid  pace.  an  informed  perspective  on  where  the  technology  and  markets  are  moving  is  invaluable  for  futureproofing  your  solution.  following  are  basic  sensor  types  regularly  utilized  in  smart  building  solutions:  temperature  sensors  measure  ambient  temperature  within  device  proximity.  typically  in  a  small  form  factor,  temperature  sensors  can  be  placed  nearly  anywhere,  giving  you  the  ability  to  identify  and  monitor  spaces  not  evenly  heated  or  cooled.  with  hvac  system  integration,  automated  adjustments  can  help  finetune  indoor  climate  as  changes  to  the  environment  dictate.
__label__environmentmonitoring this  level  of  data  visibility  and  control  can  help  optimize  energy  management  and  drive  largescale  cost  savings.  at  the  same  time  building  tenants  benefit  with  a  consistent,  comfortable  environment  leading  to  higher  productivity,  satisfaction,  etc.  in  certain  smart  building  environments,  temperature  sensors  can  also  be  used  in  specialized  climate  areas.  for  example,  server  rooms  to  identify  and  alert  when  air  intake  or  outtake  temperature  for  an  individual  server  rack  exceeds  expected  limits.  there  are  also  a  range  of  specialized  temperature  sensors  designed  for  coldchain  temperature  monitoring  e.g.  food  safety,  medicines.  these  sensors  may  have  very  specific  measurement  and  data  logging
__label__environmentmonitoring capabilities.  a  good  example  is  cdccompliant  data  loggers  for  vaccinemonitoring,  ensuring  that  medicines  remain  safe  to  administer.  often  coupled  with  a  temperature  sensor  on  the  same  device,  humidity  sensors  monitor  the  amount  of  moisture  in  the  air.  humidity  management  plays  a  large  role  in  building  climate  and  tenant  comfort.  too  little  humidity  results  in  discomfort  due  to  dryness  in  the  nose,  throat  or  eyes,  as  well  as  the  air  feeling  colder  than  it  is.  data  from  humidity  sensors  can  be  used  to  monitor  and  control  hvac  systems  to  ensure  that  humidity  is  kept  at  a  safe  and  comfortable  level  for
__label__environmentmonitoring people  and  equipment.  humidity  monitoring  is  also  important  in  maintaining  optimal  climate  conditions  in  areas  with  sensitive  and  expensive  equipment,  such  as  research  laboratories  and  highvalue  server  rooms.  pair  monitoring  with  alerting  to  proactively  address  excursion  events.  motion  sensors  and  occupancy  sensors  are  terms  often  used  interchangeably.  these  sensors  can  detect  motion  or  presence  by  using  active  detection,  passive  detection,  or  a  combination  of  both.  active  detection  sensors  emit  a  signal  and  look  for  changes  to  the  reflected  signal  to  determine  if  there  is  motion.  passive  sensors  detect  changes  in  the  infrared  spectrum,  which  occurs  when  a  person  is  within
__label__environmentmonitoring the  field  of  view  of  the  sensor  a  person  emits  heat  which  is  an  infrared  signal.  motion  and  occupancy  sensors  have  a  variety  of  uses  in  a  smart  building  environment.  presence  data  can  simplify  the  process  of  conference  room  or  hotdesk  scheduling,  improving  employee  productivity.  occupancy  data  can  provide  insight  into  heavily  trafficked  workspace  areas  and  can  be  analyzed  over  time  to  determine  improvements  to  workspace  efficiency.  data  and  analytics  from  these  sensors  can  be  tied  into  smart  lighting  or  hvac  control  systems  leading  to  cost  savings.  also  referred  to  as  a  contact  sensor,  these  devices  come  in  two  parts
__label__environmentmonitoring and  detect  when  the  two  have  been  separated.  typically,  one  part  would  be  installed  on  a  door,  bay  or  window  frame,  and  the  other  on  the  door  or  window,  placed  next  to  the  other  piece  when  in  a  closed  position.  when  the  door  or  window  is  opened  the  two  pieces  separate  and  the  sensor  detects  the  event.  contact  sensor  data  can  be  used  for  security  and  accountability,  and  to  provide  insight  into  office  traffic,  how  often  certain  rooms  are  used,  or  how  office  climate  is  affected  by  door  placement  or  window  ventilation.  air  quality  sensors  come  in  a  wide  variety
__label__environmentmonitoring of  types  and  form  factors.  common  to  smart  building  solutions  are  carbon  dioxide  co2  and  carbon  monoxide  co  sensors.  increased  carbon  dioxide  levels  can  occur  in  crowded  spaces,  or  due  to  poor  or  blocked  ventilation  often  resulting  in  a  feeling  of  stuffiness  and,  in  some  cases,  tenant  illness.  data  from  the  co2  sensor  can  used  to  adjust  the  ventilation  system.pair  monitoring  with  alerting  to  proactively  address  excursion  events.  carbon  monoxide  co  monitors  are  often  used  in  parking  garages  and  can  detect  and  alert  if  there  are  unsafe  levels  of  carbon  monoxide  in  the  air.  optical  light  sensors  measure  the  amount
__label__environmentmonitoring of  illumination  in  an  area  and  are  often  integrated  with  motion  sensors  that  trigger  lighting  in  a  room  or  area  when  presence  is  detected.illumination  sensors  can  be  used  to  monitor  and  automatically  adjust  lighting  levels  as  the  sun  rises  or  sets,  on  bright  or  cloudy  days,  or  if  the  shades  are  up  or  down.  having  the  proper  illumination  level  in  a  work  environment  can  reduce  the  risk  of  eye  strain,  headaches  and  glare  and  provide  a  more  comfortable  environment.  accelerometers  are  used  to  measure  proper  forces  of  acceleration  and  vibration  in  a  device  or  system.  when  an  accelerometer  is  mounted

__label__environmentmonitoring such  fire  alarm  systems  are  sometimes  errorprone  and  can  react  to  nonactual  indicators  of  fire  presence  classified  as  false  warnings.  there  is  a  need  for  highquality  and  intelligent  fire  alarm  systems  that  use  multiple  sensor  values  such  as  a  signal  from  a  flame  detector,  humidity,  heat,  and  smoke  sensors,  etc.  to  detect  true  incidents  of  fire.  an  adaptive  neurofuzzy  inference  system  anfis  is  used  in  this  paper  to  calculate  the  maximum  likelihood  of  the  true  presence  of  fire  and  generate  fire  alert.  the  novel  idea  proposed  in  this  paper  is  to  use  anfis  for  the  identification  of  a  true  fire
__label__environmentmonitoring incident  by  using  change  rate  of  smoke,  the  change  rate  of  temperature,  and  humidity  in  the  presence  of  fire.  the  model  consists  of  sensors  to  collect  vital  data  from  sensor  nodes  where  fuzzy  logic  converts  the  raw  data  in  a  linguistic  variable  which  is  trained  in  anfis  to  get  the  probability  of  fire  occurrence.  the  proposed  idea  also  generates  alerts  with  a  message  sent  directly  to  the  users  smartphone.  our  system  uses  small  size,  costeffective  sensors  and  ensures  that  this  solution  is  reproducible.  matlabbased  simulation  is  used  for  the  experiments  and  the  results  show  a  satisfactory  output.  fire  and  smoke

__label__environmentmonitoring such  as  a  smoke  sensor  often  being  activated  falsely  due  to  an  environmental  effect.  so,  there  is  a  need  for  a  costeffective  multisensors  expert  alarm  system  that  is  artificially  trained  and  assists  fdws  fire  detection  and  warning  system  to  make  the  right  decisions  and  to  reduce  the  number  of  false  alarms.  false  alarm  warnings  are  so  common  that  london  fire  brigade  alone  is  called  out  almost  every  10  min  to  attend  a  false  alarm  causing  them  a  loss  of  about  37  million  per  year.  to  achieve  the  aforementioned  goal,  in  this  paper,  we  introduced  a  homebased  fdms  that  uses  a

__label__environmentmonitoring alarm  can  burden  the  fire  brigade  and  can  turn  out  to  be  a  costly  event;  so  many  studies  conducted  to  reduce  them.  previous  studies  proposed  different  methods  such  as  autonomous  firefighting  robots,  fire  alarm  systems  with  notification  appliances,  and  wireless  warning  systems.  fire  alarm  systems  with  notification  appliances  can  be  costly  because  they  use  visible  and  audible  stimuli  to  notify  residents.  the  primary  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  develop  a  reproducible  and  economical  solution  with  minimum  false  alarms  and  a  system  that  alerts  via  gsm  global  system  for  mobile  communication.  the  innovative  idea  is  to  use  neurofuzzy  logic  to

__label__environmentmonitoring and  artificial  neural  network  ann  called  the  adaptive  neural  fuzzy  interface  system  anfis  can  logically  generate  fuzzy  rules  according  to  training  data  to  make  the  system  robust.  a  fire  detection  system  is  developed  using  this  aforementioned  technology  and  presented  in  this  paper  to  find  the  probability  of  fire.  the  anfis  neural  network  works  until  the  output  matches  the  desired  value  for  the  given  input.  so,  considering  these  abilities,  an  adaptive  neurofuzzy  interference  system  is  used  for  detection  of  fire.  anfis  is  a  fivelayer  architecture  that  was  developed  in  the  early  1990s.  the  first  layer  is  called  the  input  layer.  the

__label__environmentmonitoring spreadsheet.  the  training  dataset  is  required  for  anfis  training  in  matlab  to  train  the  proposed  fdws  reading  of  the  sensor  data  gathered  in  realtime  situations  under  different  scenarios  like  reading  in  normal  conditions,  severe  conditions,  and  critical  severe  conditions.  the  actual  data  gathered  from  smoke,  temperature,  humidity,  and  flame  sensors  to  train  anfis  data  is  acquired  in  an  excel  sheet  under  all  scenarios.  the  collected  data  helps  in  training  the  anfis.  shows  the  collected  data.  crtemp,  crtemp,  and  time  of  fire  detection  with  experiment  1.  in  the  above  table,  the  realtime  data  are  gathered  using  different  sensors  to  find  the
__label__environmentmonitoring expected  input  datasets  for  anfis  for  the  proposed  fdws.  the  data  is  gathered  in  two  different  experiments.  the  first  column  of  time  interval  represents  the  period  of  time  of  the  fire  to  occur,  and  the  second  column  represents  the  change  rate  of  temperature  in  c.  the  third  column  represents  the  humidity  change  rate  and  the  fourth  is  for  the  smoke  change  rate  in  ppm  in  the  presence  of  fire.  in  the  first  iteration  of  the  experiment,  when  there  is  no  fire  present,  the  change  rate  of  the  temperature,  humidity  and  smoke  are  not  changing  and  are  hence,  zero.  during  the
__label__environmentmonitoring second  iteration  with  the  presence  of  fire,  the  rate  of  temperature  is  increased  to  2  c,  the  humidity  is  changed  to  2  and  the  3.8  ppm  smoke  rate  is  changed.  in  the  same  way,  the  results  of  the  second  experiment  are  collected  and  shown  in  .  crtemp,  crtemp,  and  time  of  fire  detection  with  experiment  2.  the  results  of  experiments  used  to  calculate  the  universe  of  discourse  for  crtemp,  crhumidity,  and  crsmoke  are  illustrated  in  .  the  universe  of  discourse  for  each  membership  function.  the  simulation  of  the  proposed  system  is  done  in  matlab.  an  excel  file  has  been  created
__label__environmentmonitoring that  shows  various  vital  parameters  of  fire  presence  with  reference  to  time.  it  receives  data  from  sensor  nodes  and  continuously  displays  it  in  realtime  using  plxduq.  the  graph  of  each  input  shows  variations  of  data  inputs  at  that  time.  a  set  of  scenarios  like  no  fire,  medium  fire,  and  critical  fire  were  chosen.  anfisedit  command  is  used  to  open  the  anfis  training  window  or  anfis  is  also  found  in  the  fuzzy  control  toolbox.  we  stored  that  data  in  a  fuzzy  file  and  used  it  for  the  training  of  the  anfis  with  100  epochs.  another  set  of  data  was  provided  to

__label__environmentmonitoring a  flame  is  present,  it  will  jump  to  the  next  step  in  further  evaluating  the  severity  of  fire  by  checking  other  important  parameters.  the  presence  of  flame  is  necessary  to  go  to  the  next  step.  rules  for  fmws  according  to  flame  presence.  jang  1993  was  the  father  of  anfis  which  was  based  on  the  sugeno  fuzzy  logic  model.  generally,  anfis  combines  the  least  square  estimation  and  backpropagation  for  membership  function  measurements.  the  integration  of  fuzzy  logic  with  neural  networks  increases  the  learning  ability  of  neural  network  and  fuzzy  system.  each  generated  rule  is  a  linear  combination  of  inputs  and  a
__label__environmentmonitoring constant  term.  the  final  output  is  calculated  by  weighing  the  output  of  each  rule.  rules  should  not  be  more  than  output  member  functions.  the  proposed  system  has  four  inputs,  but  for  simplicity  purposes,  two  inputs  x  and  y  and  one  output  z  are  used.  the  rules  based  on  the  sugeno  ifthen  rules  are  as  follows:  the  anfis  structure  model  is  illustrated  in  .  it  has  five  layers.  the  input  layer  called  layer  0  is  not  part  of  the  five  layers.  the  presented  system  has  four  inputs  crtemperature,  crhumidity,  time  the  rate  at  which  input  changes,  and  crsmoke.  the  anfis  structure.
__label__environmentmonitoring layer  1  is  the  fuzzification  layer.  each  node  of  layer  1  produces  the  membership  grades  of  a  linguistic  label  as  the  generalized  bell  function.  where  a  ,  b  ,  c  is  the  premise  parameter  set.  the  shape  of  the  bell  function  varies  as  the  parameter  values  change.  the  product  a  x  .  b  y  represents  the  strength  of  a  rule.  x  and  y  in  equation  4  represent  inputs  with  value  a  and  b  ,  respectively.  layer  3  normalizes  the  firing  strength  of  all  the  rules  by  calculating  the  ratio  using  equation  5  provided  that  the  summation  of  the  strength  of
__label__environmentmonitoring all  the  rules  with  1  data  is  1.  layer  4  nodes  are  called  adaptive  nodes.  these  nodes  compute  the  parameter  function.  p  q  and  b  are  consequent  parameters  set.  the  parameters  in  this  layer  refer  as  consequent  parameters.  layer  5  is  the  output  layer  and  summation  of  all  the  outputs  coming  from  layer  4.  the  raw  data  given  as  input  is  then  converted  into  the  desired  output  using  the  anfis  technique.  anfis  weighted  that  input  data  and  mapped  it  to  output  for  fire  detection;  in  realtime,  the  smart  fire  detection  and  monitoring  system  is  combined  with  fuzzy  interference  and  neural
__label__environmentmonitoring network.  the  four  vital  inputs  are  checked  using  the  gaussian  form  of  membership  functions.  the  developed  fuzzy  interference  model  is  shown  in  .  anfis  sugeno  engine.  each  membership  function  plot  is  given  in  ,  ,  and  ,  respectively,  for  crtemperature  change  rate  of  temperature,  crhumidity,  crsmoke,  and  time  variations.  crtemp  mf  plot.  mf  plot  for  crhumidity.  mf  plot  for  time.  mf  plot  for  smoke.  after  defining  input  membership  functions  and  output,  the  training  process  automatically  generates  the  rules.  the  training  process  requires  the  implementation  in  the  sugeno  method  to  train  the  fuzzy  linguistic  labels.  the  training.dat  file,  which  contains  training
__label__environmentmonitoring data  collected  from  sensors,  is  provided  to  anfis.  after  successful  training,  it  generated  54  rules.  the  generated  rules  are  shown  in  .  it  shows  different  parameters  of  fire  based  on  the  and  operator.  for  anfis  training  command  to  work,  the  initial  fis  structure  must  have  each  rule  with  a  different  output  membership  function;  that  is,  the  number  of  output  membership  functions  must  equal  the  number  of  rules.  anfis  generated  rules.  the  simulation  of  hardware  used  in  the  proposed  system  is  done  in  proteus  8.1  using  dh22  as  a  temperature  and  humidity  sensor;  for  gas  concentration,  an  mq7  co  detector  sensor

__label__environmentmonitoring building  a  strong  ecosystem  across  verticals  for  winwin  fires  are  always  alarming,  even  terrifying.  they  kill  people  and  ruin  families  with  their  destruction.  it  is  critical  that  we  enhance  fire  safety  awareness  and  use  firefighting  equipment  intelligently  to  minimize  losses  and  damages.  smoke  detectors  are  automated  sentries,  able  to  detect  smoke  in  real  time.  if  the  density  of  smoke  exceeds  a  predetermined  threshold,  a  smart  smoke  detector  will  send  information  to  the  backend  management  platform  and  activate  related  devices  such  as  alarm  bells.  the  platform  will  then  automatically  send  the  information  to  the  corresponding  departments  and  alert  the  right  personnel
__label__environmentmonitoring by  voice  messages  or  sms.  however,  traditional  standalone  smoke  detectors  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  smart  firefighting.  they  report  false  alarms  and  cannot  interact  with  people  like  the  property  owners,  security  guards,  or  fire  fighters.  distributed  installation  is  difficult  and  expensive.  powerhungry  traditional  smoke  detectors  require  frequent  battery  replacements  and  are  more  expensive  to  maintain.  nbiotbased  smart  smoke  detection  lack  many  of  the  disadvantages  of  traditional  smoke  detectors  such  as  difficult  cabling,  short  battery  life,  high  maintenance  costs,  and  an  inability  to  interact  with  people.  this  solution  is  plugandplay,  easy  to  deploy,  and  thanks  to  using  wireless  communications  technologies,  requires
__label__environmentmonitoring no  cabling.  the  smart  smoke  detector  features  low  power  consumption  and  a  battery  standby  life  of  over  10  years.  there  is  no  need  to  frequently  replace  the  battery  which  makes  maintenance  less  expensive.  the  solution  can  report  on  an  ongoing  fire  in  real  time,  and  promptly  report  wide  spectrum  of  potential  issues.  this  valuable  information  can  reduce  property  losses  and  save  lives.  the  solution  can  also  access  a  big  data  platform  to  help  the  government  make  critical  decisions  and  eliminate  fire  hazards.  smart  smoke  detection  helps  operators  explore  new  opportunities,  increase  revenue,  and  develop  entirely  new  markets.  the  solution  enables
__label__environmentmonitoring ordinary  residents  to  prevent  household  fires  with  only  a  minimal  investment,  and  ensures  the  safety  of  the  homes  and  the  people  who  live  there.  moreover,  this  solution  helps  the  fire  departments  better  prevent  economic  and  physical  losses.  huawei  and  china  unicom  shanghai  have  jointly  deployed  200  hothink  pilot  smart  smoke  detectors  in  a  subdistrict  in  shanghai.  when  there  is  a  fire,  the  alarm  system  will  automatically  inform  the  property  owners,  service  personnel,  and  fire  fighters  using  a  texttospeech  tts  system.  this  can  ensure  prompt  evacuation,  minimize  casualties,  prevent  economic  and  physical  losses,  and  commercialize  operations  of  public  fire  services.  smart
__label__environmentmonitoring fire  alarm  systems  are  essential  in  providing  an  early  warning  in  the  event  of  fire.  they  help  to  save  lives  and  protect  property  whilst  also  fulfilling  the  needs  of  insurance  companies  and  government  departments.  fire  alarm  systems  typically  consist  of  several  interlinked  components,  such  as  smoke  detectors,  heat  detector,  carbon  monoxide,  manual  call  points,  sounders,  alarm  and  buzzer.  the  fire  alarm  system  should  give  immediate  information  in  order  to  prevent  the  fire  spread  and  protect  live  and  property.  to  get  maximum  protection  a  shoe  manufacturer  in  indonesia  opted  fora  new  fire  alarm  system  to  monitor  13  production  sites  spread  over

__label__environmentmonitoring fire  detectors  play  a  very  important  role  in  industries,  shops,  malls,  residential  complexes,  parking  areas  etc.  they  help  in  detecting  fire  or  smoke  at  an  early  stage  and  can  help  in  saving  lives.  commercial  fire  detecting  systems  usually  have  an  alarm  signalling,  with  the  help  of  a  buzzer  or  siren.  we  have  designed  an  iot  based  fire  alerting  system  using  temperature  and  smoke  sensor  which  would  not  only  signal  the  presence  of  fire  in  a  particular  premise  but  will  also  send  related  information  through  iot.  internet  of  things  iot  is  basically  the  network  of  things  by  which  physical  things  can
__label__environmentmonitoring exchange  data  with  the  help  of  sensors,  electronics,  software  and  connectivity.  these  systems  do  not  require  any  human  interaction.  in  this  arduino  fire  alarm  system  using  temperature  and  smoke  sensor  using  iot  project,  we  can  send  live  information  like  temperature,  smoke  value  detected  by  a  particular  device  to  the  fire  department.  iot  based  fire  alerting  system  uses  two  sensors,  namely,  temperature  and  smoke  sensors.  there  is  an  adc  convertor,  which  converts  the  analog  signals  received  at  the  sensor  end  to  digital  and  then  transmits  them  to  the  microcontroller,  arduino.  the  microcontroller  is  programmed  to  turn  on  the  buzzer,  when  the
__label__environmentmonitoring temperature  the  smoke  reach  a  threshold  value.  at  the  same  time,  arduino  sends  the  data  to  the  wifi  module  esp8266.  esp8266  is  a  chip  which  is  used  for  connecting  microcontrollers  to  wifi  network.  esp8266  will  then  the  following  data  to  the  iot  website,  where,  authorized  people  can  take  appropriate  measure  in  order  to  curb  the  fire.  a.  temperature  in  degree  celsius  b.  smoke  value  in  percentage  c.  device  id  d.  date  and  time  stamp  device  id  is  the  unique  id  given  to  a  device,  which  would  help  the  personnel  get  information  related  to  the  location,  where  the  fire  is  detected.
__label__environmentmonitoring the  prerequisite  for  this  iot  based  fire  alarming  system  is  that  the  wifi  module  should  be  connected  to  a  wifi  zone  or  a  hotspot.  this  project  is  also  implemented  without  the  iot  module.  in  place  of  the  iot  module,  we  have  used  gsm  module,  by  which  an  sms  is  triggered  when  the  buzzer  is  turned  on.  the  components  that  are  used  in  the  iot  based  fire  alerting  system  using  temperature  and  smoke  sensor  project  are  1.  smoke  sensor  2.  temperature  sensor  3.  analog  to  digital  convertor  4.  microcontroller  arduino.  5.  lcd  display  6.  esp8266  7.  buzzer  video  is  not  available

__label__environmentmonitoring for  many  years,  the  installation  of  fireprotection  systems  has  been  strictly  a  capital  expenditure  with  recurringoperating  costs.  typically,  the  standard  procedure  has  been  to  read  the  fire  alarm  system  specification,  look  at  the  drawings,  price  the  project  and  then  hopefully  win  the  project.  the  rest  of  the  job  is  typically  prewiring  and  installing  the  specified  or  accepted  fire  alarm  system.  the  goal  is  to  finish  the  fire  alarm  system  installation  with  a  profit  and  go  on  to  the  next  one.  previously,  i  discussed  the  fact  that  the  smart  building  concept  has  been  struggling  to  gain  a  foothold  in  the  building
__label__environmentmonitoring community.  now,  through  the  internet  of  things  iot,  it  will  become  a  more  effective  way  to  decrease  capital  costs  and  greatly  reduce  operating  costs.  the  national  electrical  manufacturers  association  nema  has  established  the  highperformance  buildings  council  to  promote  the  adoption  of  highperformance  technologies  and  systems  that  increase  the  energy  efficiency,  safety,  resilience,  sustainability,  productivity,  and  security  of  federal,  commercial  and  multifamily  residential  buildings.  nema  has  established  highperformance  building  goals  that  include  increased  building  life  spans,  improved  material/product  durability,  improved  building  operations,  improved  building  maintenance,  increased  cost  performance,  enhanced  occupant  productivity  and  improved  occupant  safety.  with  the  iot  concept,  building  owners

__label__environmentmonitoring meet  the  owners  goals  while  still  providing  codecompliant  life  safety  systems.  it  also  depends  on  your  ability  to  learn  the  changing  installation  techniques  and  wiring  systems  allowed  for  fire  alarm  systems  in  nfpa  72  2016,  national  fire  alarm  and  signaling  code.  for  example,  the  code  already  allows  a  fire  alarm  system  to  be  installed  on  an  ethernet  network  using  class  n  cabling  techniques.  first,  nfpa  72,  section  3.3.67,  defines  a  class  n  device  as  a  supervised  component  of  a  life  safety  system  that  communicates  with  other  components  of  life  safety  systems  and  that  collects  environmental  data  or  performs  specific  input
__label__environmentmonitoring or  output  functions  necessary  to  the  operation  of  the  life  safety  system.  typically,  class  n  devices  include  components  connected  to  a  class  n  ethernet  network  that  monitors  inputs  from  the  environmentsuch  as  smoke  or  heatand  provides  outputs  that  address  all  the  other  life  safety  equipment.  endpoint  is  another  new  term.  nfpa  72  2016,  section  3.3.92,  defines  a  class  n  endpoint  as  the  end  of  a  pathway  where  a  single  addressable  device  or  a  control  unit  is  connected.  as  stated  in  annex  a  for  endpoint,  an  endpoint  device  originates  and/or  terminates  a  communication  stream  and  does  not  forward  it  to  other
__label__environmentmonitoring devices.  class  n  pathways  are  defined  by  their  performance.  section  12.3.6  states:  a  pathway  shall  be  designated  as  class  n  when  it  performs  as  follows:  ethernet  network  devices  are  addressablesimilar  to  fire  alarm  devices  on  an  slc  loopbut  with  an  important  distinction:  a  device  with  an  ethernet  address  typically  has  a  dedicated  cable  connected  to  the  physical  endpoint.  they  are  unlike  the  typical  devices  on  an  slc  loop  that  are  all  on  the  same  communication  line.  the  ethernet  network  switches  direct  data  packets  to  each  intended  recipient  device.  understanding  the  technology  of  the  future  is  important  if  you  plan  to

__label__environmentmonitoring during  last  decades;  the  expansion  of  urban  areas  near  forests,  called  urbanwildland  interface,  put  human  population  and  their  assets  at  higher  risk  of  wildfires  than  ever  before  .  thus,  the  strategy  of  the  fire  management  and  the  preparedness  towards  the  continuously  extended  severe  fire  danger  season  must  be  updated  and  enhanced.  in  the  smart  computing  context,  cloud  computing  the  internet  of  things  iot  and  big  data  analytics  are  properly  orchestrated  to  provide  assisting  applications  for  human  daily  activities  such  as  education,  health  and  transportation.  these  complex  applications  are  either  time  and  missioncritical  applications  with  stringent  requirements.  dealing  with  natural  disasters,
__label__environmentmonitoring like  wildfires,  is  an  interesting  field  for  the  development  of  such  applications,  since  the  early  and  precise  detection  of  a  forest  fire  is  the  most  important  step  for  intime  firefighting.  various  iot  node  arrangements,  for  example  wireless  sensor  networks  wsn  and,  more  recently,  unmanned  aerial  vehicle  uav  clusters  equipped  with  remote  sensing  capabilities,  have  enabled  the  detection  of  wildfires  ,  and  the  automatic  notification  of  the  responsible  public  authorities.  the  ability  to  perceive  their  environment  and  react  to  its  changes,  perform  basic  data  processing  and  exchange  information,  alongside  the  excellent  scalability  and  the  low  capital  and  operational  expenditures,  makes  iot
__label__environmentmonitoring networks  a  reliable  solution  for  autonomous  monitoring  of  large  forest  areas.  however,  as  these  networks  typically  comprise  of  small  battery  powered  devices  performing  multiple  tasks,  limited  energy  resources  and  the  scarcity  of  computation  capabilities  for  realtime  processing  are  the  most  important  disadvantages  towards  their  wide  adoption  in  the  firefighting  domain.  dealing  with  these  shortcomings,  edge  computing  is  a  new  service  delivery  paradigm  that  can  provide  rich  computation  resources  near  iot  portable  devices.  in  the  specific  case  of  wildfires,  a  cluster  of  powerful  servers  is  placed  at  the  edge  of  the  network  and  enables  the  offloading  and  processing  of  the  iot
__label__environmentmonitoring nodes  computationintensive  tasks,  e.g,  image  recognition,  in  order  to  reduce  their  energy  consumption  and  achieve  the  applications  strict  time  constraints.  the  proliferation  of  social  media  use  by  large  population  proportions  along  with  recent  advances  in  data  sensing,  collection,  storage  and  analysis,  supports  the  realization  of  the  participatory  data  gathering  paradigm,  also  known  as  social  sensing.  data  that  are  produced  on  social  media  services  can  act  as  an  additional  source  of  information  valuable  in  various  application  domains,  including  the  scope  of  disaster  prevention,  detection,  control  and  assessment.  for  example,  recent  research  efforts  have  evaluated  the  use  of  social  media  in  relation
__label__environmentmonitoring to  extreme  weather  incidents  ,  earthquake  events  detection  ,  and  to  estimate  diseases  spread  such  as  influenza  and  malaria  .  these  initial  findings  suggest  that  social  media  may  provide  a  promising  approach  for  detecting  and  mapping  environmental  hazards  and  climaterelated  impacts,  however  a  robust  methodology  has  yet  to  be  defined  and  validated.  in  particular,  within  the  scope  of  wildfire  detection,  social  media  users,  who  happen  to  be  in  the  proximity  of  a  fire  incident,  can  provide  valuable  information  and  testimony  about  the  current  situation  and  help  to  timely  and  accurately  detect  a  wildfire  .  the  potential  of  this  approach  has
__label__environmentmonitoring been  also  confirmed  by  european  commissions  jrc  initiative  named  digital  earth  nervous  system  .  generally,  all  the  aforementioned  technologies  can  be  parts  of  a  cyberphysical  system  cps,  which  integrates  computing,  networking  and  human  resources.  more  specifically,  in  this  article,  we  propose  a  threelevel  cyberphysical  social  system  cpss  for  early  fire  detection.  at  the  bottom  level,  a  network  consisting  of  static  or  mobile  iot  nodes  monitors  forest  areas  for  detecting  fires  at  their  initial  stage.  following  the  machine  learning  trend  ,  these  nodes  are  equipped  with  embedded  camera  modules  to  enable  computer  visionbased  fire  detection.  thus,  at  the  middle  level,  a
__label__environmentmonitoring scalable  edge  computing  framework  for  early  fire  detection  smoke,  hosts  two  image  classification  services,  which  processes  field  snapshots  captured  from  the  iot  nodes.  smoke  is  actually  a  dynamic  resource  scaling  mechanism  for  iotenabled,  time  and  missioncritical  applications,  meant  to  be  deployed  at  a  cluster  of  servers  at  the  network  edge,  in  the  nodes  proximity,  assisting  the  offloading  of  computationally  intensive,  energy  hungry  tasks.  at  the  top  level,  a  cloudbased  decisionmaking  service  combines  the  classification  results  of  the  previous  level,  users  actions  on  the  social  media  and  other  services,  such  as  weather  information  services,  in  order  to  accurately  infer  the  fire
__label__environmentmonitoring incident  severity  and  notify  the  responsible  authorities.  this  study  extends  the  work  in  and  the  main  contributions  of  it  can  be  summarized  to  the  following  three  main  topics:  a  vertical  scaling  mechanism;  contrary  to  a  cloud  computing  environment,  the  computational  resources  available  on  the  servers  located  at  the  edge  are  limited  .  hence,  the  simultaneous  tenancy  of  more  than  one  applications  at  each  edge  server  may  risk  the  quality  of  service  qos  satisfaction.  consequently,  a  dynamic  resource  allocation  and  admission  control  mechanism  is  developed  with  the  use  of  a  linear  switching  system  and  a  state  feedback  controller.  a  horizontal  scaling
__label__environmentmonitoring mechanism;  in  the  same  direction,  this  optimization  mechanism  is  responsible  for  the  activation/deactivation  of  each  edge  server,  the  placement  of  the  applications  instances  within  them  and  the  distribution  of  the  incoming  offloaded  requests  among  those  instances,  while  taking  into  account  various  performance  criteria.  a  cloud  decision  making  service;  among  the  main  challenges  in  early  detection  of  fire  related  emergency  situations  is  the  richness  of  the  data  that  are  gathered  from  various  sources  either  sensors  or  humans,  the  efficient  and  fast  processing  of  them  and  finally  the  estimation  of  the  criticality  level  of  the  emergency  situation.  in  this  work,  the  decision
__label__environmentmonitoring support  system  aims  to  combine  data  from  diverse  sources  such  as  iotgenerated  images,  satellite  information,  historic  weather  data  and  social  media  services  but  at  the  same  time  aims  to  produce  decisions  in  a  timely  manner.  the  rest  of  the  article  is  organized  as  follows.  in  ,  the  current  state  of  the  art  is  presented.  demonstrates  the  architecture  of  the  proposed  cpss,  while  in  the  theoretical  background  and  mathematical  justification  behind  the  developed  components  of  the  architecture  is  thoroughly  presented  and  analyzed.  the  evaluation  of  the  proposed  system  in  an  emulated  environment  comes  at  ,  while,  finally,  draws  the  conclusions  and
__label__environmentmonitoring possible  extensions  of  this  study.  in  this  section,  we  present  the  most  interesting  studies  in  bibliography  from  the  perspectives  of  iot,  edge  and  cloud  computing,  social  media  and  imagebased  wildfire  and/or  emergency  detection.  zhang  et  al.  composed  a  study  on  the  application  of  iot  infrastructures  on  the  fire  fighting  industries.  in  that  work,  the  status  quo  regarding  the  usage  and  the  main  characteristics  that  make  iot  devices  appealing,  was  presented,  while,  subsequently,  suggestions  on  the  wider  adoption  of  them  in  the  fire  fighting  domain,  were  discussed,  with  china  as  the  main  example.  in  the  same  direction,  the  authors  in  analyzed
__label__environmentmonitoring the  trend  of  leveraging  cloud  computing  and  iot  techniques  on  agriculture  and  forestry.  on  the  first  part,  several  relevant  applications  of  these  paradigms  were  listed;  there,  forest  monitoring  for  fire  prevention  held  a  significant  place.  on  the  second  part,  ideas  on  the  combination  of  those  two  for  maximizing  vegetation  benefits  were  proposed.  another  iot  setting,  this  time  in  the  form  of  a  wireless  sensor  network  was  studied  in  ,  to  support  early  fire  detecting  activities;  this  work  briefly  discussed  some  indoors  as  well  as  forest  based  installations.  finally,  on  their  search  for  additional  flexibility,  the  authors  in  used  images  captured
__label__environmentmonitoring from  uavs  to  detect  forest  fires.  the  forest  fire  detection  index  was  utilised,  alongside  other  classification  methods  for  vegetation  classification  and  tonalities  of  flames  and  smoke  in  order  to  assess  the  spread  rate.  one  of  the  difficulties  that  software  systems  aiming  to  integrate  multiple  information  sources  has  to  face  is  the  homogenization  of  data.  this  issue,  also  known  as  data  interoperability,  is  one  of  the  key  requirements  in  building  crossdomain  iot  applications  and  it  gets  even  more  complicated  when  the  goal  is  to  combine  information  sources  from  completely  diverse  software  services  areas  e.g.,  iot  and  social  networking  services.  there  are
__label__environmentmonitoring various  ongoing  standardization  efforts  toward  this  scope  and  organizations  such  as  ieee  standards  association,  aioti,  onem2m  and  w3c  are  in  collaboration  trying  to  reach  consensus  on  defining  common  apis  and  data  models  within  the  iot  application  domain  .  in  addition,  and  with  regards  to  machinetomachine  interoperability  the  european  telecommunications  standards  institute  etsi  contributes  to  the  worldwide  standardization  efforts  along  with  onem2m  through  the  onem2m  global  initiative  in  order  to  standardize  a  common  m2m  service  layer  platform  for  globally  applicable  and  accessindependent  m2m  services  .  in  the  study  ,  authors  defined  a  common  approach  and  data  model  able  to  represent  in
__label__environmentmonitoring a  uniform  way  information  both  from  iot  environment  and  social  media  services.  the  data  homogenization  issue  in  the  presented  approach  is  tackled  based  on  the  adaptation  of  semantic  and  syntactic  interoperability  mechanisms  which  are  detailed  presented  in  ,  .  in  the  case  of  wildfires,  social  media  can  be  a  powerful  crowdsensing  tool  for  situation  awareness  and  fast  data  diffusion.  a  review  on  the  us  of  social  media  on  forest  fire  detection  was  presented  in  .  this  study  categorized  the  wildfire  risk  management  systems  and  the  social  media  methodologies  followed,  crowdsourcing  applications  developed  and  social  media  frameworks  deployed  for  disaster  management.
__label__environmentmonitoring furthermore,  a  sensing  process  based  on  social  media  data  management  and  a  general  architecture  of  a  wildfire  social  sensor  management  platform  were  proposed.  the  following  social  mediabased  studies  are  the  most  relevant  to  our  approach.  wang  et  al.  provided  a  twitterbased  spatial,  temporal  and  content  analysis  for  wildfires.  the  kernel  density  estimation  kde  method  was  used  to  analyze  the  possible  spatial  patterns  of  the  tweets  referring  to  the  wildfires.  this  analysis  was  also  combined  with  the  temporal  evolution  of  the  tweets  and  a  term  frequency  analysis  to  validate  the  ability  of  social  media  to  characterize  an  emergency  over  time  and
__label__environmentmonitoring space.  also,  other  parameters,  such  as  the  influence  of  the  opinion  leaders,  were  taken  into  account.  twitcident  was  a  webbased  system  connected  to  emergency  broadcasting  services  that  automatically  searched,  filtered  and  classified  emergency  situations.  additionally,  analytical  tools  and  users  were  allowed  to  make  customized  searches  for  specific  events,  including  wildfires.  in  the  5g  context,  dynamic  scaling  of  edge  and  cloud  computing  resources,  i.e.,  the  onruntime,  ondemand  provisioning  of  the  amount  and  type  of  server  resources,  plays  a  key  role  for  the  performance  guarantee  of  time  and  missioncritical  applications.  on  the  contrary,  a  priori,  static  resource  provisioning  fails  to  deal  with
__label__environmentmonitoring unanticipated  changes  in  resource  demands  .  resource  scaling  can  also  be  classified  as  either  vertical  or  horizontal  .  with  the  term  vertical  scaling  ,  we  refer  to  the  ability  of  increasing/decreasing  the  capacity  of  existing  virtual  machines  vms  or  containers  by  dynamically  adding/removing  cpu  cores,  ram  or  storage;  on  the  other  hand,  horizontal  scaling  deals  with  the  activation/deactivation  of  servers  and  the  number  of  virtual  machines  or  containers  to  be  placed  in  them.  the  interested  reader  can  refer  to  for  a  complete  survey  on  cloud  elasticity.  leontiou  et  al.  proposed  a  hierarchical  vertical  and  horizontal  scaling  framework  for  cloud  services.
__label__environmentmonitoring at  the  bottom  level,  fuzzy  takagisugeno  systems  were  used  to  model  the  dynamic  operation  of  the  vms  and  a  robust  controller  was  designed  to  guarantee  the  quality  of  service  qos  requirements  and  a  stability  analysis  was  discussed.  at  the  top  level,  an  unbounded  knapsack  problem  was  solved  in  order  to  simultaneously  tackle  the  application  placement  within  the  active  servers  and  the  load  balancing  of  the  incoming  requests  into  the  vms.  saikrishna  et  al.  proposed  an  algorithm  to  develop  a  multiobjective  switching  controller  that  ensured  asymptotic  stability  with  pole  placement  and  addressed  the  problem  of  performance  management  of  a  webserver  hosted
__label__environmentmonitoring on  a  private  cloud.  moreover,  in  ,  grimaldi  et  al.  used  a  pid  gain  scheduler  to  horizontally  scale  the  available  resources  dynamically  and  achieve  a  desired  cpu  use.  similar  to  our  work,  the  authors  tried  to  maintain  the  control  error  close  to  zero  by  splitting  the  operating  spectrum  of  each  vm  to  distinct  regions  and  solving  an  optimization  problem  to  calculate  the  controller  gains  within  them.  finally,  the  authors  of  used  operating  regions,  as  well,  and  designed  specific  models  to  represent  the  behavior  of  each  one  of  them;  multiple  fixed  pi  feedback  controllers  which  alternated  on  runtime  based  on  the
__label__environmentmonitoring operating  region,  comprised  a  switching  control  system  that  dynamically  allocated  cpu  capacity  to  the  vms  in  order  to  achieve  a  desired  average  response  time.  contrary  to  cloud  computing,  little  attention  has  been  given  to  the  dynamic  resource  scaling  in  edge  computing  settings.  the  resource  provisioning  problem  on  edge  computing  is  usually  dictated  by  the  computation  offloading  strategy.  computation  offloading  is  the  process  of  redirecting  the  heavy  processing  tasks  of  mobile  or  iot  devices  to  a  nearby  edge  computing  infrastructure  for  execution.  most  of  the  proposed  computation  offloading  studies  used  fixed  modeling  and  static  resource  provisioning  for  the  edge  computing  resources.
__label__environmentmonitoring however,  these  resources  are,  as  we  mentioned  earlier,  limited  and  a  dynamic  resource  scaling  approach  is  necessary  to  guarantee  qos.  jia  et  al.  proposed  a  load  balancing  framework  for  geographically  spread  cloudlets,  i.e.,  smallscale  data  centers  or  clusters  of  computers  designed  to  quickly  provide  cloud  computing  services  to  mobile  and  iot  devices,  within  close  geographical  proximity.  the  operation  of  each  cloudlet  was  modeled  with  the  use  of  queuing  models  and  static  provisioning  of  cloudlet  resources  was  adopted.  a  scalable  load  balancing  algorithm  was  then  used  to  minimize  the  maximum  average  application  response  time  of  the  cloudlets.  in  ,  the  authors
__label__environmentmonitoring presented  a  comprehensive  analysis  on  energy  consumption  modeling  in  edge  computing  settings.  these  models  were  classified  as  either  static,  flowbased  or  timebased.  furthermore,  considering  various  network  parameters,  the  energy  consumption  in  cloud  and  edge  computing  related  scenarios  was  discussed.  the  experimental  results  demonstrated  that  computation  offloading  can  significantly  reduce  the  energy  consumption  of  iot  devices.  maga  proposed  a  mobilityaware,  genetic  algorithmbased  decision  system  that  aimed  to  improve  the  offloading  success  rate  and  reduce  the  energy  consumption  on  mobile  devices  while  the  response  time  requirements  were  met.  frequent  user  mobility  patterns  were  inferred  via  a  tail  matching  subsequence  mobile  access  prediction
__label__environmentmonitoring method  and  a  modified  genetic  algorithm  decided  which  components  of  the  work  flow  were  to  be  offloaded  or  executed  locally  otherwise.  the  resource  provisioning  of  the  cloudlets  was  considered  static.  this  article  proposes  a  hierarchical  cpss  that  leverages  the  advantages  of  some  of  the  abovementioned  technologies.  at  the  bottom  level,  the  sensing  capabilities  of  iot  devices  are  exploited  for  continuous  fire  monitoring.  the  computation  intensive  image  processing  is  offloaded  to  the  middle  level,  where  the  smoke  framework  implements  the  horizontal  and  vertical  scaling  of  the  edge  servers  resources,  in  order  to  guarantee  specific  response  time  requirements.  finally,  at  the  top,
__label__environmentmonitoring cloud  computing  layer,  the  image  classification  results  are  forwarded  and  combined  with  various  sensor  data,  as  well  as  with  a  spatial  and  temporal  analysis  of  social  media  actions  and  then  a  decision  making  service  infers  additional  information  on  the  incident  severity.  this  information  is  subsequently  forwarded  to  the  responsible  local  authorities  for  further  actions.  the  hypothetical  scenario  addressed  in  this  work  describes  an  iot  network,  consisting  of  iot  nodes  equipped  with  camera  modules  e.g.,  raspberry  pis  or  iq  firewatch  ,  capturing  images  in  order  to  detect  emergency  incidents  i.e.,  fire.  at  the  same  time,  we  assume  that  wireless  sensors  are
__label__environmentmonitoring scattered  in  the  same  forest  area;  in  our  case,  a  wireless  sensor  is  nothing  more  than  a  low  cost  sensor,  monitoring  gasemissions,  humidity  or  smoke  in  the  trees  or  vegetation.  the  proposed  cpss  is  envisioned  as  a  semirural  area  installation  were  forests  are  in  the  proximity  of  a  populated  area.  this  has  a  twofold  effect  on  the  system;  first,  its  whole  operation  is  based  on  a  local  private  network  e.g.,  wlan  and  a  cellular  network  is  not  necessary.  second,  civilians  with  mobile  devices  are  present.  the  sensors  data  alongside  the  information  provided  from  the  iot  nodes  and  the  social  media
__label__environmentmonitoring traffic  produced  by  the  human  factor,  are  fed  to  a  decisionmaking  service  deployed  on  the  cloud,  able  to  assert  the  risk  level  and  give  further  guidance  to  public  authorities.  finally,  an  emergency  mode  of  the  cpss  is  specified,  when,  in  the  case  of  a  possible  fire  outbreak  and  in  order  to  better  examine  the  incident,  there  is  a  rapid  increase  of  the  pictures  needed  to  be  analyzed.  thus,  regarding  this  iotbased  fire  detection  scenario,  the  following  identified  usecase  requirements  evince  the  importance  of  a  scalable  edge  computing  architecture  to  accommodate  the  offloading  of  the  computationally  demanding  processes  to  the  network
__label__environmentmonitoring edge.  the  ability  of  wildfires  to  spread  out  extremely  quickly  ,  makes  the  detection  and  suppression  at  an  early  stage  a  necessity.  such  timecritical  applications,  demand  lowlatency  access  to  servers  at  the  edge  of  the  network,  ability  to  perform  rapid  computations  and  take  immediate  decisions.  as  mentioned  above,  although  iot  nodes  demonstrate  excellent  firedetecting  fitting  capabilities  like  automation  and  control  of  their  functionality  in  relation  to  their  perception  of  the  environment,  wireless  data  transferring,  small  size  and  the  ability  to  form  scalable  networks,  they  usually  lack  the  computational  and  energy  resources  to  perform  complex  tasks  and  operate  autonomously  for  prolonged
__label__environmentmonitoring periods  of  time.  as  a  result,  frequent  usage  of  sensors,  communication  and  data  processing  has  to  be  minimized  in  order  to  find  a  balance  between  increasing  battery  life  and  accurate  incident  detection.  the  proposed  edge  computing  approach  enables  iot  nodes  to  offload  energy  and/or  computational  hungry  tasks  i.e.,  image  recognition  to  servers  in  proximity,  wirelessly  via  a  local  network.  this  placement  enables  lowlatency  access  to  the  servers,  contrary  to  the  access  to  the  remote  cloud  through  the  public  internet,  which  might  be  unpredictable  when  it  comes  to  response  times.  the  hypothesis  that  iot  nodes  produce  a  fluctuating  workload,  depending  on
__label__environmentmonitoring whether  they  operate  normally  or  in  the  emergency  mode  ,  increases  and  decreases  the  offloading  rate  for  a  specific  edge  server  rapidly.  as  a  result,  computational  needs  at  the  edge  of  the  network  may  vary  differently  from  time  to  time  for  the  image  recognition  application.  there  is  also  the  possibility  that  additional  applications  are  colocated  at  the  edge  servers;  this  makes  static  resource  provisioning  a  problematic  situation  that  may  lead  to  resource  underuse  and  subsequently  to  hold  the  ability  of  applications  to  coexist  at  the  same  server  back,  or  resource  overuse  which  will  possibly  introduce  delay  to  the  execution  off
__label__environmentmonitoring the  offloaded  requests  and  jeopardize  the  applications  missioncritical  aspect.  thus,  the  need  for  fine  grained  resource  allocation  and  qos  guarantee  is  evident.  a  critical  obstacle  when  integrating  information  from  heterogeneous  sources  is  that  the  underlying  information  systems  e.g.,  iot  platforms  are  mainly  isolated  and  act  as  vertical  silos.  the  lack  of  interoperability  among  these  systems  impedes  the  creation  of  crossdomain,  crossplatform  and  crossorganizational  services.  to  overcome  these  obstacles  syntactic  and  semantic  interoperability  solutions  are  necessary  to  be  enforced.  to  this  end,  syntactic  interoperability  is  associated  with  the  ability  of  systems  to  exchange  information  in  order  to  communicate  on  a  technical
__label__environmentmonitoring abstraction  level.  semantic  interoperability,  denotes  the  ability  of  different  applications  and  business  entities  to  understand  exchanged  data  in  a  similar  way,  implying  a  precise  and  unambiguous  meaning  of  the  exchanged  information.  a  common  challenge  that  society  has  to  address  in  the  recent  years  is  to  keep  a  balance  between  preventing  and  mediating  the  damage  that  occurs  from  disastrous  situations  without  on  the  same  time  violating  human  rights  such  as  the  right  of  privacy  protection  of  individuals.  advances  on  sensing  technologies  and  data  collection  mechanisms  make  feasible  the  deployment  of  vast  sensor  networks  that  can  potentially  become  intrusive  and  violate  established
__label__environmentmonitoring regulations  e.g.,  gdpr.  edge  computing  paradigm  assists  in  keeping  the  processing  at  the  edge  of  the  network  thus  avoiding  the  indiscriminate  transmission  and  storage  of  sensitive  information,  such  as  image  and  video  recordings.  in  this  section  we  describe  in  more  detail  the  design  of  our  cpss  architecture.  as  depicted  in  ,  the  designed  system  consists  of  two  main  agents,  namely  the  smoke  framework  and  the  intelligent  decision  making  component,  and  four  subordinate  agents  which  interact  with  each  other  and  contribute  in  a  unique  way  to  deal  with  the  emergency  incident;  the  iot  nodes,  the  sensors,  the  social  media  and  the
__label__environmentmonitoring public  authorities.  the  intelligent  decision  making  agent  operates  as  a  cloud  component  gathering  data  from  the  other  components,  operating  as  the  top  layer  of  this  cpss.  although  this  proposed  architecture  is  intrinsically  linked  with  the  earlyfire  detection  use  case,  which  is  studied  in  this  work,  it  can  be  easily  adapted  to  accommodate  a  variety  of  settings  with  similar  requirements.  cpss  architecture.  the  smoke  framework  follows  a  topdown  design  in  a  manner  that  there  exists  a  centralized  controller  that  makes  the  decisions  which  are  in  turn  propagated  to  the  lower  levels  of  the  architecture  to  be  realized  by  local  controllers.  the
__label__environmentmonitoring proposed  architecture  is  generally  applicable  in  a  singlesite  edge  computing  infrastructure  but  can  be  easily  expanded  for  edgetocloud  or  edgetoedge  collaboration;  its  components  are  described  in  detail  bellow.  smoke  supports  the  simultaneous  management  of  cohosted  applications  that  are  able  to  receive  offloaded  requests  on  the  edge  servers.  the  only  prerequisite  is  that  those  applications  be  containerized.  in  this  work,  for  the  sake  of  demonstrating  the  multitenancy  efficiency  of  smoke,  we  developed  two  tensorflowbased  object  recognition  applications  able  to  recognize  images  containing  events  of  interest  i.e.,  fire,  which  were  trained  offline  in  a  supervised  manner.  these  applications  were  then  containerized  and
__label__environmentmonitoring deployed  on  the  docker  platform  installed  of  each  edge  server.  containers  were  selected  instead  of  vms,  as  a  means  of  virtualization,  because  of  their  overall  lower  overhead,  smaller  footprint  and  lightweight  vertical  scalability.  the  offloaded  traffic,  generated  by  the  iot  nodes,  is  directed  to  the  central  controller  located  on  the  central  server  through  a  local  wireless  access  point.  here  lies  the  upper  level  control  process  of  our  mechanism,  as  depicted  in  .  to  accommodate  this  control  process,  time  in  our  framework  is  quantized  in  discrete  time  intervals;  at  the  beginning  of  each  time  interval  this  component  selects  an  appropriate  container
__label__environmentmonitoring formation  to  be  implemented  to  each  edge  server  directly  connected  to  it  and  consequently  distributes  the  incoming  workload  accordingly.  this  formation  defines  the  number  of  active  servers  alongside  the  number  and  the  operating  point  of  the  containers  to  be  placed  in  them.  with  the  term  operating  point  we  refer  to  the  number  of  the  offloaded  requests  that  each  container  will  accept,  the  number  of  cores  that  it  will  be  allowed  to  use,  as  well  as  the  average  response  time  it  is  requested  to  achieve  during  the  next  time  interval.  these  operating  points  of  the  containers  are  calculated  on  the  local
__label__environmentmonitoring controllers  ,  as  described  in  the  next  section.  this  control  process,  hereinafter  referred  to  as  horizontal  scaling  ,  is  performed  in  an  online  and  proactive  manner,  leveraging  an  internal  prediction  mechanism,  the  workload  predictor  ,  which  provides  an  estimation  on  the  number  of  requests  to  be  expected  on  the  time  interval,  for  each  application.  the  essential  input  for  this  estimation  process  is  provided  by  the  monitoring  service  component  of  the  local  controller  deployed  in  each  edge  server,  which  is  responsible  for  collecting  data  regarding  both  the  network  traffic  i.e.,  offloading  requests  admitted  and  endtoend  response  times  and  the  containers  resources
__label__environmentmonitoring use  i.e.,  cpu  usage  at  each  given  time.  then,  the  optimizer  component  uses  the  output  of  the  workload  predictor  and  the  feasible  operating  points,  calculated  offline,  and  computes  the  optimal  number  of  active  servers  and  containers  required  to  meet  the  different  performance  criteria.  the  theoretical  background  of  this  process  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in  .  hence,  depending  on  the  aforementioned  decision  and  considering  the  predicted  workload  for  each  time  interval,  the  central  controller  dictates  the  creation,  scaling  and  destruction  of  the  applicationspecific  containers  to  the  local  controllers  accordingly.  also,  at  the  end  of  each  time  interval,  the  average  classification
__label__environmentmonitoring score  of  the  offloaded  images  is  calculated  here.  additionally,  when  a  classification  score  above  a  predefined  threshold  emerges,  indicating  a  possible  fire  outbreak,  information  is  transmitted  to  the  respective  iot  node  regarding  its  new  operating  mode  normal  or  emergency.  the  time  between  the  capturing  of  the  image  of  interest  and  the  transmission  of  the  updated  iot  node  information  is  defined  as  the  applications  response  time.  all  the  monitoring  data  involved  in  this  process  are  stored  in  a  relational  database  present  in  the  central  server,  in  order  to  be  used  for  demonstration  purposes.  it  is  also  worth  noting  here  that,  physically,
__label__environmentmonitoring the  central  server  is  nothing  more  than  an  edge  server,  located  on  the  users  proximity,  with  a  more  advanced  role;  this  of  the  decision  maker.  smoke  architecture.  at  the  lower  level,  each  edge  server  is  equipped  with  a  local  controller,  responsible  for  both  gathering  the  requestrelated  statistics  from  the  containers,  we  mentioned  earlier,  needed  for  the  monitoring  service  and  tackling  the  small  fluctuations  of  the  incoming  workload,  according  to  the  predicted  number  of  requests  for  each  time  interval.  the  lower  level  control  process  implemented  in  this  component  moderately  scales  the  containers  vertically,  providing  the  required  resources,  thus  realizing  the  decision
__label__environmentmonitoring made  by  the  central  controller.  in  more  technical  terms,  the  communication  between  the  central  controller  and  the  local  controllers  is  performed  via  a  restapi  present  in  the  latter;  the  local  controller  also  uses  the  docker  platform  in  order  to  scale  the  containers.  this  vertical  scaling  ensures  that  the  containers  remain  within  and  area  around  the  selected  operating  point,  hence  guaranteeing  minimum  and  stable  application  response  times,  in  order  to  meet  certain  qos  requirements.  provides  further  mathematical  justification  for  this  process.  this  intelligent  decision  making  idm  service  is  deployed  on  the  cloud  layer  of  the  proposed  architecture.  the  geotagged  images  are
__label__environmentmonitoring processed  and  classified  at  the  smoke  framework  on  the  edge  layer  and,  if  the  average  classification  score  is  above  a  confidence  threshold  of  fire  and  smoke  detection,  then  an  ongoing  emergency  situation  probably  occurs  and  the  idms  operation  is  triggered.  in  order  to  further  evaluate  the  criticality  of  the  incident  at  the  targeted  area  additional  data  are  collected  by  the  data  collection  engine  in  order  to  be  fed  to  the  decision  algorithm  .  the  latter  applies  logical  rules  on  the  provided  data  collection  in  order  to  timely  infer  the  level  of  the  associated  danger  of  the  situation  and  render  the
__label__environmentmonitoring respective  estimation  in  an  intuitive  manner.  as  it  is  illustrated  in  ,  the  main  data  sources  integrated  with  this  system  are:  the  smoke  service  provides  the  classification  score  of  the  images  along  with  the  time  and  location,  in  terms  of  gps  coordinates  corresponding  to  the  iot  nodes  location,  from  the  associated  area  that  the  images  was  captured.  it  is  the  image  classification  score  that  triggers  the  overall  data  gathering  process,  while  additional  data  are  retrieved  based  on  location  criteria  indicated  by  the  respective  images  coordinates.  to  this  end,  a  reverse  geocoding  process  is  applied  in  order  to  extract  the  associated
__label__environmentmonitoring readable  addresses  and  place  names  which  are  particularly  useful  in  the  retrieval  of  data  from  social  media  services.  the  european  forest  fire  information  system  effis  calculates  on  a  daily  bases  an  index,  called  forest  fire  weather  index,  for  all  the  regions  of  eu  based  on  environmental  and  weather  related  information,  such  as  the  humidity  of  the  air  at  the  beginning  of  the  afternoon;  the  temperature  in  the  middle  of  the  afternoon;  the  precipitation  during  the  last  24  h;  the  maximum  speed  of  the  average  wind.  the  fire  danger  is  mapped  in  five  classes  with  a  spatial  resolution  of  about  16
__label__environmentmonitoring km.  the  fire  danger  classes  are  the  same  for  all  eu  countries  and  information  is  provided  encoded  as  geotiff  format  maps  showing  a  harmonized  picture  of  the  spatial  distribution  of  fire  danger  level  throughout  eu.  the  geotiff  standard  allows  georeferencing  information  to  be  embedded  within  a  tiff  file.  the  fire  danger  forecast  maps  are  updated  daily  and  are  freely  available  from  the  effis  online  service  .  the  actual  file  has  a  small  size  1  mb  hence  it  can  be  efficiently  processed.  the  five  classes  of  the  forest  fire  weather  index  embedded  as  different  color  codes  bands  in  the  geotiff  file
__label__environmentmonitoring are:  fuels  do  not  ignite  readily  from  small  firebrands  although  a  more  intense  heat  source,  such  as  lightning,  may  start  fires  in  duff  or  light  fuels.  fires  can  start  from  most  accidental  causes,  but  with  the  exception  of  lightning  fires  in  some  areas,  the  number  of  starts  is  generally  low.  all  fine  dead  fuels  ignite  readily  and  fires  start  easily  from  most  causes.  fires  start  easily  from  all  causes  and,  immediately  after  ignition,  spread  rapidly  and  increase  quickly  in  intensity.  fires  start  quickly,  spread  furiously,  and  burnt  intensely.  all  fires  are  potentially  serious.  in  the  current  implementation  of  the  idm
__label__environmentmonitoring the  twitter  microblogging  platform  has  been  integrated.  twitter  maintains  a  total  number  of  335  million  monthly  active  users,  who  produce  more  than  500  million  number  of  tweets  per  day.  the  fact  that  80  percent  of  twitter  users  use  the  service  through  mobile  devices,  makes  this  social  network  an  ideal  platform  for  applying  the  social  sensing  paradigm.  in  addition,  twitter  has  been  selected  in  the  scope  of  the  work  presented  in  this  article  due  to  its  openness  and  the  almost  unrestricted  access  to  the  publicly  available  user  provided  content  and  profile  information  through  apis.  data  collection  for  the  needs  of  the
__label__environmentmonitoring idm  is  facilitated  through  hashtags  and  keywords  associated  with  wildfires  combined  with  tags  denoting  georeference.  although  twitter  offers  the  option  to  geotag  the  provided  tweets,  this  feature  is  not  frequently  used,  thus  it  can  not  be  exploited  effectively  for  the  needs  of  the  idm  service.  on  the  other  hand,  it  is  a  common  practice  for  twitter  users  to  introduce  their  own  tags  in  order  to  express  the  connection  of  their  post  with  an  area.  the  reverse  geocoding  allows  the  idm  to  extract  a  set  of  local  area  names,  also  expressed  in  local  language,  which  will  be  used  as  keyword  criteria
__label__environmentmonitoring for  retrieving  tweets  that  potentially  are  associated  with  an  emerging  wildfire  incident.  intelligent  decision  making  architecture.  the  decision  algorithm  aggregates  information  from  the  described  sources,  homogenizes  their  input  and  generates  a  normalized  score  that  ranges  from  zero  to  one  highest  value  denoting  the  emergency  level.  the  overall  operation  is  triggered  periodically  by  smoke  classification  score  and  runs  continuously,  meaning  that  the  idm  may  receive  multiple  images  scores  from  various  locations,  where  a  decision  should  be  extracted  for  each  case.  as  it  is  already  stated,  the  image  classification  score  is  the  main  criterion  for  the  early  identification  of  the  fire  incident
__label__environmentmonitoring while  the  additional  data  gathered  are  utilised  in  order  to  further  evaluate  the  severity  of  the  incident  in  terms  of  human  presence  in  the  area,  potential  fire  spreading,  etc.  as  described  in  the  previous  section,  a  single  smoke  deployment  consists  of  the  many  local  controllers  and  one  central  controller;  each  local  controller  aims  at  controlling  and  regulating  the  operation  of  the  containers  that  run  on  the  same  edge  server  with  it;  the  central  controller  makes  the  decisions  on  the  activation  of  the  edge  servers  and  the  respective  containers,  as  well  as  the  load  balancing  of  the  incoming  requests.  trying  to
__label__environmentmonitoring be  compliant  with  the  taxonomy  defined  on  the  survey  on  ,  the  local  controller  was  designed  to  use  linear  switching  systems  for  modeling  the  containerized  applications  and  a  state  feedback  controller  for  each  linear  system,  designed  to  apply  admission  control  decisions.  at  the  same  time,  the  central  controller  solves  a  mixed  integer  programming  problem  to  determine  the  number  of  active  servers  and  containers,  which  are  necessary  for  serving  the  total  workload  of  the  hosted  applications.  as  mentioned  above,  the  dynamic  operation  of  the  containerized  applications  is  modeled  with  the  use  of  switching  linear  systems,  with  the  switching  criterion  being  the
__label__environmentmonitoring number  of  the  allocated  cpu  cores  to  each  container.  this  modeling  approach  captures  the  dynamic  behavior  of  the  containers  under  different  operational  conditions  and  enables  us  to  perform  indirect  resource  allocation.  in  our  case,  the  various  operational  conditions,  under  which  the  modeling  is  performed,  include  different  image  sizes,  resolutions  and  transmission  delays  depending  on  the  network  congestion  at  each  given  moment  per  request  and  a  variety  of  request  rate  values.  so,  for  each  different  cpu  core  allocation,  the  operation  of  the  container  is  described  by  a  discrete  linear  system  of  the  following  form,  where  is  the  state  variable  that  expresses
__label__environmentmonitoring the  average  application  response  time  for  time  interval  t  and  is  the  control  variable  that  represents  the  number  of  the  admitted  requests  within  time  interval  t  .  here,  with  the  term  admitted  we  describe  the  requests  that  are  actually  allowed  to  the  container  for  processing.  the  parameters  and  b  of  the  above  model  are  estimated  by  using  the  recursive  least  square  rls  algorithm  .  physically,  a  container  with  c  allocated  cores  is  constrained  to  serving  up  to  requests  of  the  containerized  application  while  maintaining  an  average  response  time  of  .  this  pair  is  called  an  operating  point  and  generally,  for
__label__environmentmonitoring each  such  switching  system,  a  set  of  feasible  operating  points  of  this  kind  can  be  computed  according  to  various  performance  criteria  and  while  taking  into  account  the  constraints  of  the  state  and  input  variables.  in  our  case,  these  feasible  operating  points  are  computed  by  solving  the  following  linear  programming  with  the  goal  of  maximizing  the  number  of  the  admitted  requests:  the  first  constraint  implies  that  each  operating  point  must  also  be  an  equilibrium  of  the  discrete  linear  system  and  this  will  guarantee  its  stability  and  confinement  in  a  specific  operating  area  around  it.  the  second  constraint  dictates  that  the  state
__label__environmentmonitoring variable  must  lay  between  a  minimum  and  a  maximum  value  set  by  the  applications  requirements,  while  the  last  constraint  refers  to  the  control  variable  varying  between  the  minimum  available  and  the  maximum  available  value  .  for  each  operating  point  of  every  linear  system,  a  state  feedback  controller  is  designed  in  order  for  the  respective  containerized  application  to  meet  the  response  time  requirements.  this  control  law  is  defined  as,  where  is  the  control  gain.  applying  in  ,  we  get  the  closed  loop  form  of  the  linear  system,  where  is  a  constant  term.  regulating  the  eigenvalue  of  the  system  ,  the  stability
__label__environmentmonitoring of  the  closed  loop  system  and  the  convergence  speed  to  the  equilibrium  point  are  affected.  thus,  we  select  a  stable  eigenvalue,  which  lays  inside  the  unitary  circle,  in  order  to  compute  the  control  gain  .  to  give  a  better  understanding  of  the  whole  process  illustrates  a  block  diagram  describing  the  closed  loop  system.  the  following  list  explains  the  role  of  each  signal  presented  there,  reference  input  :  the  average  application  response  time  for  the  respective  operating  point  .  control  error  :  the  difference  between  the  actual  average  response  time  of  the  last  interval  and  the  reference  value,  .  controller  :

__label__environmentmonitoring the  central  controller  on  the  top  layer,  is  to  decide  the  switching  action  for  the  horizontal  scaling  process,  as  described  in  .  as  shown  in  the  upper  part  of  ,  the  optimizer  component  consumes  information  regarding  the  available  operating  points  and  the  predicted  workload,  for  the  next  time  interval,  for  each  application.  the  prediction  of  incoming  workload,  estimated  according  to  a  linear  trend  forecasting  procedure  as  described,  in  ,  alongside  the  operating  points  facilitate  the  formulation  of  an  optimization  problem  solved  by  the  optimizer;  as  mentioned  earlier,  the  assumption  that  each  application  is  deployed  to  at  most  one  container  per
__label__environmentmonitoring edge  server  is  made.  furthermore,  at  a  preliminary  stage,  an  offline  exhaustive  procedure  where  all  the  feasible  combinations  of  the  containerized  applications  operating  points  within  a  server,  is  calculated.  feasible  combinations  are  the  ones  that  do  not  exceed  the  total  computational  capacity  of  the  respective  server.  then,  the  optimizer  minimizes  the  number  of  active  servers  and  the  allocated  cpu  resources  by  solving,  sequentially,  two  mixed  integer  linear  optimization  problems  milps.  at  the  first  milp,  the  minimum  number  of  edge  servers  to  be  activated  on  the  next  time  interval,  in  order  to  serve  the  estimated  workload,  is  determined  by  solving  the
__label__environmentmonitoring following,  here,  the  first  constraint  dictates  that  the  servers  to  be  activated  are  selected  from  the  pool  of  the  available  servers.  the  next  two  constraints  imply  that  each  of  the  selected  containers  to  be  deployed  on  the  selected  servers  corresponds  to  an  existing  operating  point  and  that  their  placement  on  the  active  servers  must  correspond  to  an  acceptable  combination.  finally,  the  last  constraint  means  that  the  estimated  total  workload  for  each  application,  ,  must  be  served  by  the  containers.  on  the  second  milp,  the  minimum  amount  of  computational  resources,  in  terms  of  cpu  cores  per  container  per  server,  are  computed,
__label__environmentmonitoring while  taking  into  account  the  result  of  the  previous  optimization,  where  is  the  number  of  allocated  cpu  cores  to  the  container  of  the  i  th  containerized  application  on  the  j  th  activated  server.  the  reason  behind  distinguishing  the  optimization  process  into  two  distinct  subproblems  is  that,  at  first,  we  tried  to  solve  a  multiobjective  milp  by  combining  the  two  optimization  targets  to  one  weighted  objective  function,  but  that  led  to  the  one  objective  being  successfully  optimized  while  the  other  one  concluded  to  a  suboptimal  solution,  regardless  of  the  assigned  weights.  also  it  should  be  noted  that  the  number  of  edge
__label__environmentmonitoring servers  is  relatively  small  so  the  overall  computation  time  of  these  optimization  processes  does  not  disrupt  the  central  controllers  smooth  operation.  as  already  stated,  the  decision  making  process  is  triggered  by  the  smoke  system  when  the  firerelated  average  classification  score  of  images,  captured  by  the  iot  node,  is  above  a  predefined  threshold,  thus  indicating  a  considerable  probability  of  fire  occurrence.  the  respective  score  sent  to  the  idm  is  denoted  by  ,  where  t  is  the  time  when  the  image  was  captured  by  the  iot  node  and  expresses  the  gps  coordinates  of  the  point  where  the  iot  node  was  located  at
__label__environmentmonitoring upon  image  capturing  latitude  x  and  longitude  y  .  as  already  stated,  the  value  of  lies  within  the  range  of  .  once  is  obtained,  the  idm  triggers  a  reverse  geocoding  process  in  order  to  map  the  gps  coordinates  to  a  specific  country  and  language,  and  to  extract  multiple  area  names  for  the  specified  point.  the  output  of  this  process  is  a  set  of  locationrelated  keywords  or  tags  denoted  by  .  various  combinations  of  these  tags  coupled  with  terms  linked  with  fire  emergency  are  generated  and  are  subsequently  fed  to  the  twitter  api  in  order  to  fetch  all  tweets  that  involve
__label__environmentmonitoring the  specific  term  combinations  and  are  posted  in  the  latest  window  frame  of  duration  .  the  population  of  the  retrieved  tweets  that  use  both  keywords  linked  to  the  area  of  interest  as  well  as  terms  related  to  fire  emergencies  is  then  averaged  by  the  population  of  all  tweets  that  only  use  keywords  linked  to  the  area  of  interest.  a  respective  social  media  score  is  eventually  calculated  that  lies  within  the  range  of  .  with  regards  to  the  fire  weather  index  fwi  provided  by  effis,  the  idm  retrieves  the  respective  values  from  the  geotiff  image  that  correspond  to  the  specified  gps
__label__environmentmonitoring coordinates  of  the  point  of  interest  .  to  deliver  this,  mapping  of  the  gps  coordinates  above  to  the  geotiff  geo  reference  system  is  necessary.  the  value  of  the  retrieved  fwi  for  the  specified  coordinates  is  and  the  respective  normalized  score  is  that  lies  within  the  range  of  .  finally,  the  idm  estimates  an  overall  score  of  fire  incident  at  point  p  and  time  t  that  indicates  the  severity  of  fire  incident  occurrence  and  is  expressed  as  where  the  weights  ,  ,  indicate  the  significance  of  the  respective  scores,  lie  within  the  range  of  and  for  which  it  stands  that  .
__label__environmentmonitoring the  experiments  conducted  so  far  have  assumed  that  ,  considering  the  reliability  of  the  respective  information  sources.  the  nature  of  the  assigned  weights  indicate  that  the  image  classification  engine  is  considered  as  more  important  for  the  initial  detection  of  the  fire  incident  while  the  other  two  sources  of  information  social  media  data  and  effis  have  a  complementary  role  in  further  evaluating  the  severity  of  the  situation.  in  this  section  the  experimental  setup  is  thoroughly  presented  alongside  an  evaluation  of  the  obtained  results.  at  first,  the  significant  role  of  smoke  is  evinced,  after  intense  experimentation  for  proof  of  concept  of  the
__label__environmentmonitoring horizontal  and  vertical  resource  scaling  on  an  edge  computing  topology  and  a  comparison  of  the  proposed  architecture  with  the  naive  solution  of  the  static  resource  allocation  is  presented.  subsequently,  a  timerelated  evaluation  on  the  sociallyaware  intelligent  decision  making  component,  with  input  from  social  media,  additional  sensors  data  and  image  classification  scores  produced  by  the  smoke  framework,  is  discussed.  to  demonstrate  the  operation  of  a  smoke  installation,  the  hypothetical  setting  of  a  forest  and  iot  nodes  mounted  on  uavs  that  fly  over  it,  while  capturing  images  in  order  to  detect  fire  occurrence,  is  emulated.  as  discussed  at  ,  at  the  same
__label__environmentmonitoring time  we  assume  the  presence  of  wireless  sensors  and  civilians  using  social  media  in  the  field.  furthermore,  two  additional  assumptions  are  made;  first,  that  due  to  the  large  space  uavs  need  to  cover  and  investigate,  each  one  of  them  takes  over  a  smaller  area,  while,  second,  in  the  case  of  a  possible  fire  outbreak,  they  are  dictated  to  gather  to  the  area  of  interest  to  better  examine  the  incident,  leading  to  a  rapid  increase  of  the  pictures  offloaded.  uavs  were  selected  as  the  evaluation  scenario  because,  although  they  pack  amazing  characteristics  like  operational  versatility  and  durability  in  various  weather  conditions,
__label__environmentmonitoring they  usually  lack  the  resources  to  accommodate  longspanning  missions,  like  vast  forest  areas  surveillance.  additionally,  the  hypothesis  that  uavs  gather  in  a  specific  geographic  area  when  certain  events  occur,  and  spread  otherwise,  allows  us  to  denote  the  finegrained,  scalingenabled  resource  allocation  taking  place  on  our  system.  at  this  point,  it  should  be  made  clear  that  uavbased  image  analysis  and  fleet  coordination  algorithms  are  decoupled  from  the  cpss  initial  design  and  operation.  therefore,  given  the  context  and  focus  of  this  paper,  uav  actual,  real  world  operational  methods  and  algorithmsthough  very  challenging  and  of  high  practical  importanceare  considered  outofscope  of  this  study.
__label__environmentmonitoring they  just  serve  the  purpose  of  a  conventional  use  case  to  enable  the  demonstration  of  the  capabilities  of  such  a  combination  of  an  edge  computing  framework  and  a  decisionmaking  platform.  the  first  experiment  illustrates  the  performance  of  the  smoke  framework  when  deployed  on  the  netmode  testbed  at  the  national  technical  university  of  athens  in  greece.  in  this  case,  two  identical  16core  edge  servers  with  16  gb  of  ram  were  used,  that  each  hosted  two  tensorflow  based  applications,  deployed  in  separate  docker  containers  as  explained  in  .  without  loss  of  generality,  we  made  the  assumption  that  each  edge  server  can  host
__label__environmentmonitoring exactly  one  container  of  each  of  these  applications,  due  to  the  fact  that  more  than  one  instances  of  the  same  service  would  introduce  additional  overhead  costs  when  deployed  on  different  containers  on  the  same  host.  the  differentiation  between  those  two  applications,  developed  solely  for  the  experimentation  purposes,  was  that  the  first  implemented  an  image  classification  for  conventional,  visible  light  pictures,  while  the  second  one  for  infrared  pictures.  the  model  trained  for  the  conventional  image  recognition  was  fed  with  a  specific  dataset  containing  either  pictures  of  forest  wildfires  or  plain  forests.  for  the  infrared  recognition  model,  we  used  a  synthetic  dataset,
__label__environmentmonitoring generated  from  the  aforementioned  one,  by  applying  an  infrared  photoshop  effect  to  each  image.  following  the  architecture  described  earlier,  these  edge  servers  also  hosted  an  instance  of  the  local  controller.  regarding  the  emulation  of  the  uavs,  two  raspberry  pi  devices  were  acting  as  the  mobile  nodes,  each  of  which  was  assigned  to  offloading  requests  to  the  edge  servers,  targeting  one  of  the  two  applications.  the  mobile  nodes  were  connected  via  wifi  to  an  alix3d2based  node  hosting  the  central  controller,  which  was  in  turn  linked  via  ethernet  to  the  two  identical  edge  servers.  this  whole  setting  represented  a  fully  deployed  smoke
__label__environmentmonitoring installation  in  a  forest  area.  it  should  be  once  again  noted  that  the  process  from  the  moment  a  uav  captured  an  image  and  offloaded  it  to  the  proximate  edge  server  infrastructure  for  processing  until  the  result  was  calculated,  as  stated  before,  was  defined  as  the  response  time.  in  addition  to  this,  it  was  assumed  that  the  edge  servers  were  responsible  for  the  uavs  operating  mode,  depending  on  the  situations  severity.  thus,  the  time  until  the  detection  of  a  possible  fire  incident,  i.e.,  the  response  time,  should  kept  below  an  acceptable  value.  finally,  the  average  classification  score  of  the  captured  images
__label__environmentmonitoring was  calculated  and  advertised  to  the  idm  on  the  cloud  nodes,  at  each  time  interval.  in  the  presented  emulation,  this  time  interval,  that  additionally  defines  the  overall  operation  of  the  smoke  framework,  as  explained  in  ,  is  set  to  30  s.  to  make  the  offloading  patterns  more  plausible,  the  amount  of  requests  produced  within  the  interval  follows  a  poisson  distribution,  while  the  interarrival  time  between  two  successive  requests  follows  an  exponential  distribution.  as  depicted  in  the  third  diagrams  of  and  ,  the  experiment  scenario  kicks  off  with  the  raspberry  pis  offloading  an  average  of  around  10  requests  per  time  interval
__label__environmentmonitoring bluecolored,  solid  line,  for  each  application,  simulating  a  normal  period  where  no  fire  indications  are  present  in  the  forest  area  tracking  mode  .  after  approximately  5  min,  the  average  number  of  requests  per  interval  starts  escalating,  mimicking  the  uavs  behaviour  of  gradually  approaching  the  area  of  interest,  i.e.,  the  frameworks  proximity,  when  an  emergency  situation  is  detected  emergency  mode  .  this  average  value  peaks  and  stabilizes  at  25  from  the  20th  to  the  40th  simulation  min,  where  it  is  assumed  that  a  fire  has  been  recognized  and  more  visual  coverage  of  its  area  and  spread  rate  is  required.  finally,  in
__label__environmentmonitoring the  last  part  of  the  emulation,  the  offloading  request  generating  rate  returns  to  normal  values,  reflecting  the  wildfire  being  put  under  control  and  subsequently  the  uavs  reverting  back  to  their  normal  operating  mode.  conventional  tensorflow  application.  infrared  tensorflow  application.  regarding  the  evaluation  of  the  scaling  mechanism  of  our  framework,  one  can  observe  in  the  second  diagrams  of  and  ,  that  the  central  controllers  horizontal  scaler  adapts  to  the  increased  requirements  in  computational  resources  while  on  emergency  mode  bluecolored  solid  line  and  dictates  the  activation  of  a  second  server  blackcolored,  dashed  line  between  the  10th  and  40th  min  of  the  emulation,

__label__environmentmonitoring operating  points  for  both  applicationspecific  containers,  from  which  the  horizontal  scaler  gets  to  choose;  each  operating  point  defines  the  nominal  amount  of  offloaded  requests,  ,  that  the  respective  container  is  able  to  process,  alongside  the  reference  input  ,  when  1,  2,  3  or  4  cores  are  allocated  to  it.  a  remark  regarding  the  restriction  of  cores  to  be  made  available  to  each  container  to  4,  is  that  this  seemed  to  be  a  plateau  where  the  containers  became  saturated  and  could  not  serve  significantly  more  requests,  despite  allocating  more  cores  to  them.  furthermore,  one  can  observe  that  certain  outliers  in  the
__label__environmentmonitoring poisson  distribution,  of  either  rapid  increase  or  decrease  in  the  offloading  requests,  cause  the  workload  predictor  to  poorly  estimate  the  incoming  workload  for  the  following  time  interval;  this  results  to  an  increased  amount  of  rejected  requests,  as  well  as  a  slight  oscillation  on  the  number  of  activated  servers.  server  operating  points.  with  respect  to  the  vertical  scaling  part  of  smoke,  the  admission  control  process,  executed  on  each  local  controller  of  each  server,  results  in  the  rejection  of  approximately  19.58  of  the  offloaded  requests  for  the  conventional  image  recognition  application  and  23.01  for  the  infrared  one  blackcolored  dashed  line  in  each
__label__environmentmonitoring third  diagram  of  and  .  this  is  a  consequence  of  the  real  incoming  workload  of  the  interval  exceeding  the  projected  one.  although  the  rejected  volume  is  not  negligible,  it  is  not  detrimental  to  the  event  detection  precision.  as  a  reminder,  both  these  scaling  processes  aim  to  maintain  the  average  response  time  below  an  acceptable  value,  ,  which  is  an  applicationspecific  value.  to  achieve  this,  the  reference  input  of  each  operating  point  is  empirically  set  near  to  .  in  our  scenario,  is  set  equal  to  10  s  for  both  applications,  thus  the  reference  inputs  of  the  operating  points  in  are  set
__label__environmentmonitoring to  3  s  and  3.5  s  respectively.  this  goal  is  achieved,  as  depicted  with  the  bluecolored  solid  line  in  the  first  diagrams  in  both  and  ;  the  response  time  remains  within  the  limit  of  10  s,  despite  the  workload  fluctuations.  in  these  diagrams,  average  transmission  and  computation  times  are  also  plotted  with  redcolored,  dotted  and  blackcolored,  dashed  lines  respectively;  one  can  easily  note  that  the  average  response  time  follows  the  same  patterns  as  the  average  computational  time,  meaning  that  it  is  mainly  affected  by  it.  the  average  transmission  time  is  negligible  due  to  the  use  of  the  ieee  802.11ac  standard,
__label__environmentmonitoring which  provides  high  throughput  for  the  images  size  of  about  5  mb  used  in  this  experiment.  finally,  the  vertical  scaling  of  smoke  is  compared  to  a  static  allocation  of  four  cores  for  each  application;  with  the  greencolored,  dot  dashed  line  on  each  first  subfigure  we  denote  the  average  response  time  of  this  static  allocation,  while  on  each  second  the  total  cores  statically  allocated.  one  can  easily  observe  that  when  the  experiment  is  on  the  tracking  mode,  it  demonstrates  better  average  response  times  for  both  applications,  however,  it  still  suffers  from  the  phenomenon  of  overprovisioning;  that  is  when  a  container  uses
__label__environmentmonitoring resources,  that  could  be  allocated  other  processes,  without  significant  benefits.  on  the  other  hand,  when  the  experiment  enters  the  emergency  mode,  there  are  times  when  4  statically  allocated  cores  are  inadequate  for  the  processing  requirements,  resulting  in  violation  of  the  10  s  limit  for  the  average  application  response  time.  this  problem  of  providing  less  than  the  necessary  resources  is  called  underprovisioning  and  it  potentially  puts  the  missions  accuracy  into  risk.  as  stated  in  ,  the  sociallyaware  intelligent  decision  making  process  is  triggered  when  the  smoke  component  calculates  an  average  classification  score  of  the  images  offloaded  in  the  last  time  interval
__label__environmentmonitoring that  is  associated  with  a  high  probability  of  fire  incident  detection.  in  this  subsection,  the  evaluation  results  of  the  idm  component  are  presented  focusing  on  the  overall  time  overhead  that  is  imposed  until  a  final  fire  detection  decision  is  reached.  to  this  end,  several  experiments  have  been  executed  in  order  to  identify  the  average  time  delays  imposed  by  the  various  individual  steps  of  the  idm  algorithm.  these  steps  are  the  following:  reverse  geocoding  process  of  the  provided  gps  coordinates,  which  is  based  on  the  call  of  external  apis  e.g.,  google  maps  api  in  order  to  obtain  a  set  of  area
__label__environmentmonitoring names  and  location  identifying  keywords.  extraction  of  fire  weather  index  extracted  from  the  geotiff  image  based  on  the  provided  gps  coordinates.  collection  and  analysis  of  twitter  posts  that  are  related  with  the  indicated  area.  after  executing  several  experiments,  the  results  obtained  indicate  that  the  average  time  required  for  step  a  is  0.42  s,  while  the  average  time  needed  for  step  b  is  0.08  s.  as  one  can  easily  observe,  the  introduced  time  overhead  is  minimal.  on  the  other  hand,  twitter  data  retrieval  and  tweet  processing  may  introduce  a  significant  time  overhead  that  depends  heavily  on  the  overall  number  of  tweets
__label__environmentmonitoring that  comply  with  the  retrieval  criteria  e.g.,  twitter  posts  containing  tags  and  keywords  related  with  the  area  and  a  forestfire  incident.  illustrates  the  aggregated  time  needed  for  the  idm  to  perform  steps  a,  b  and  c  for  increasing  volumes  of  retrieved  twitter  data.  in  order  to  estimate  the  expected  volume  of  twitter  data  that  is  generated  during  wildfire  incidents,  a  thorough  review  of  existing  approaches  has  been  conducted  and  an  analysis  of  the  respective  datasets  indicating  the  evolution  of  the  tweet  posts  upon  fire  incident  occurrence.  the  results,  presented  in  ,  show  that  the  total  number  of  tweets  are  not
__label__environmentmonitoring more  than  10  k  for  the  entire  duration  of  the  wildfire  incident.  in  our  case,  the  twitter  stream  api  is  utilised  and  the  retrieval  and  processing  of  tweets  is  taking  place  in  an  online  mode  aiming  to  detect  the  incident  as  soon  as  possible.  hence,  it  is  safe  to  assume  a  few  hundred  tweets  to  be  generated  within  the  first  minutes  of  the  wildfire  ignition.  therefore,  given  the  results  captured  in  ,  the  overall  time  overhead  imposed  by  the  social  media  mining  process  lies  between  5  and  40  s,  which  enables  the  proposed  idm  to  reach  a  decision  in  a
__label__environmentmonitoring timely  manner.  decision  extraction  in  relation  to  amount  of  tweets  retrieved.  a  review  of  wildfire  incidents  and  related  tweets  volumes.  all  in  all,  these  two  proposed  cpss  mechanisms  work  seamlessly  and  efficiently  towards  the  time  and  missioncritical  application  of  the  early  forest  fire  detection.  the  smoke  framework  manages  to  alleviate  the  iot  nodes  computational  workload,  timely  dictate  their  operating  mode  and  orchestrate  their  new  formation,  should  it  be  deemed  necessary,  while  the  servers  resources  are  optimally  used.  subsequently,  the  idm  is  fed  with  the  needed  information  that  enables  it  to  communicate  the  decision  promptly  to  the  public  authorities.  in  this
__label__environmentmonitoring article,  a  cyberphysical  social  system  for  early  fire  detection  is  presented;  a  scalable  edge  computing  framework,  called  smoke,  is  deployed  on  the  network  edge  and  is  receiving  captured  images  from  several  iot  nodes  to  evaluate  the  criticality  of  the  situation;  on  a  higher  level,  an  intelligent  decisionmaking  service  is  deployed  on  the  cloud,  receiving  data  from  various  sources  i.e.,  various  low  cost  sensors,  social  media  users  and  smoke  and  communicates  with  the  local  authorities  in  case  of  emergency.  our  work  focused  on  two  main  aspects,  namely  a  the  horizontal  and  vertical  scaling  of  the  available  edge  servers  resources,  in  order
__label__environmentmonitoring to  achieve  optimal  allocation  and  use  of  resources  and  b  the  decision  making  mechanism,  for  a  timecritical  application,  that  takes  the  social  factor  into  consideration.  the  proposed  computation  offloading  mechanism  is  generic  and  applicable  on  several  types  of  mobile  edge  computing  mec  environments  and  applications.  the  experiments  conducted  and  presented  in  the  previous  section  allowed  us  to  draw  some  significant  conclusions  regarding  the  performance  of  the  proposed  frameworks.  horizontal  and  vertical  scaling  of  edge  servers  is  essential  for  guaranteeing  the  qos  metrics  of  time  and  mission  critical  applications,  while  dynamic  resource  allocation  prevents  over  or  under  provisioning  of  the  edge
__label__environmentmonitoring servers  resources.  moreover,  admission  control  on  the  incoming  offloaded  requests  is  a  key  factor  for  timecritical  applications  with  stringent  requirements  in  terms  of  retention  of  the  desired  qos  levels,  like  average  task  execution  and  transmission  latency.  finally,  the  evaluation  with  regards  to  the  time  needed  for  the  idm  component  to  collect  the  necessary  data  and  extract  a  decision,  shows  that  the  overall  time  overhead  is  not  higher  than  40  s.  this  time  duration  is  considered  within  the  time  limits  of  such  a  timecritical  system  especially  considering  the  heterogeneity  of  the  collected  information  types  and  sources.  having  established  a  timeefficient  data
__label__environmentmonitoring collection  mechanism,  among  the  authors  next  steps  is  the  evaluation  of  the  provided  recommendations  and  their  comparison  with  ground  truth  data.  once  again  we  find  it  significant  to  highlight  the  fact  that  the  actual  uav  operation  is  not  a  part  of  the  cpsss  core  performance  evaluation  as  it  is  decoupled  from  it.  however,  the  extraordinary  uav  capabilities  could  further  assist  demonstrating  the  essential  scope  of  this  work.  thus,  for  future  work,  a  realworld  experimentation  of  this  proposed  cpss  architecture  will  be  in  the  spotlight.  potential  infrastructures  for  this  purpose  include  the  federation  of  testbeds  provided  by  h2020  rawfie  project,  which
__label__environmentmonitoring aims  at  providing  research  facilities  for  iot  devices,  including  uavs,  and  supporting  experiments  with  monitoring  tools  and  mechanisms  for  safely  conducting  realistic  simulations.  in  this  direction,  rawfie  provides  aeroloop  ,  a  simulation  environment  that  allows  users  to  conduct  experiments  with  multiple  virtual  uavs  vuavs  in  a  flexible  and  controlled  way  and  to  thoroughly  test  and  deeply  discover  the  frameworks  capabilities  before  trying  out  systemsoftware  and  missions  in  the  real  world.  another  issue  that  will  concern  us  is  the  use  of  the  lte  technology  as  an  alternative  to  the  wifi  access  points  currently  used  for  the  communication  between  the  iot  nodes
__label__environmentmonitoring and  the  smoke  framework.  this  will  allow  our  framework  to  expand  its  operational  range  beyond  semirural  located  forests  and  enable  the  coverage  of  vast  areas.  hence,  evaluating  and  conducting  a  comparative  study  on  trying  to  minimize  the  data  transmission  overhead  will  be  essential  for  a  complete  study  in  iotbased  early  fire  detection.  it  should  be  also  noted  that,  in  this  study,  smoke  is  deployed  on  homogeneous  servers.  however,  using  homogeneous  servers  is  not  always  pragmatic  in  a  realworld  iot  environment.  the  use  of  operating  points  enables  a  uniform  description  for  the  resources  needed  to  serve  a  specific  number  of  requests
__label__environmentmonitoring in  heterogeneous  servers.  therefore,  future  plans  aim  to  conduct  further  research  on  resource  elasticity,  modifying  the  central  controller  in  order  to  address  the  use  case  of  heterogeneous  servers.  finally,  regarding  the  idm  component,  it  lies  among  the  plans  of  the  authors  to  evaluate  further  the  accuracy  of  the  proposed  integrated  decision  making  mechanism  in  support  of  fire  detection  based  on  real  wildfire  incidents  and  extend  this  to  support  the  detection  of  other  emergencies  e.g.,  floods  or  tsunamis.  the  following  abbreviations  are  used  in  this  manuscript:  all  authors  contributed  extensively  to  the  work  presented  in  this  article.  s.p.  and  i.r.  formulated

__label__environmentmonitoring problems  usually  occurduring  the  monitoring  process  of  the  temperature  in  a  room.for  example,  a  server  room  must  be  kept  between  15  to  20degree  celsius  to  monitor  a  temperature  in  or  else  the  servermight  crash  and  can  cause  a  loss  of  hundreds  thousands.management  has  to  choose  either  to  place  a  person  tomonitor  the  temperature,  or  to  save  on  human  capital  bydeveloping  a  system  that  can  monitor  the  temperature  fromother  places  at  any  given  time.  in  order  to  solve  the  problem,  the  webbasedtemperature  monitoring  system  that  can  be  access  anywhereand  anytime  through  the  internet  is  build.  with  this  system  auser  can  remotely

__label__environmentmonitoring december  6,  2019  posted  by  on  september  7,  2017  iot  stands  for  internet  of  things  and  refers  to  small  devices  equipped  with  direct  internet  connectivity,  without  needing  an  external  computer.  they  are  usually  composed  of  a  main  microcontroller  and  an  additional  connectivity  eg.  esp8266  for  wifi,  enc28j60  for  ethernet  or  they  are  complete  soc  including  both  the  processing  unit  and  the  connectivity  modems  in  one  single  package.  regardless  of  their  form  or  shape,  these  devices  open  new  applications  for  remote  sensing  and  controlling,  and  bring  system  automation  to  a  new  level  of  performance.  examples  of  such  devices  were  presented  on
__label__environmentmonitoring this  blog  even  before  iot  was  coined  as  a  buzzword.  see  the  or  the  development  of  of  what  is  now  .  to  exemplify  the  iot  concept  i  propose  the  following  architecture:  on  the  hardware  side,  we  need  the  following  components:  for  the  backend  i  will  demo  using  the  .  this  is  handled  by  the  ,  but  alternatively  a  simple  php  script  can  be  used  too.  there  are  multiple  way  of  putting  these  together,  i  went  for  putting  the  wemos  d1  at  the  bottom,  the  battery  shield  in  the  middle,  and  the  temperature  shield  at  the  top  for  better  air  contact
__label__environmentmonitoring and  less  internal  heating  interference.  this  means  we  solder  the  female  headers  to  the  wemos  d1,  the  mixed  headers  to  the  battery  shield  and  the  male  headers  to  the  ds18b20  temperature  shield.  heres  the  result:  the  pcbs  can  now  be  stacked  in  the  proposed  order,  with  the  wemos  at  the  bottom  and  the  ds18b20  sensor  at  the  top.  heres  the  assembled  device:  with  the  simple  iot  device  ready,  we  need  to  program  it.  the  firmware  needs  to  setup  the  wifi  connection  to  an  internet  wireless  router,  then  periodically  read  the  temperature  values  and  send  them  to  the  backend.  before  we

__label__environmentmonitoring code  logic,  to  make  the  module  connect  to  an  internet  wireless  router  at  program  start,  then  periodically  read  temperature  and  send  it  to  the  backend.  the  exp  protocol  was  introduced  with  the  ,  to  implement  a  way  of  building  custom  iot  devices  with  a  variable  number  of  sensors.  it  defines  the  communication  rules  between  an  iot  device  device  and  a  backend  server  server  for  the  purpose  of  exchanging  sensor  data  data.  each  device  is  uniquely  identified  using  a  device  id  allocated  by  the  server.  all  devices  must  have  an  owner,  identified  with  a  userid  /  userkey  pair.  the  exp  protocol
__label__environmentmonitoring is  a  bidirectional  communication  protocol  for  the  very  minimum,  the  server  needs  to  return  a  unique  allocated  device  id,  the  very  first  time  a  device  connects  or  in  case  the  device  reports  an  invalid  device  id.  most  of  the  traffic  however  is  for  uploading  data  from  the  iot  device  to  the  server.  the  exp  protocol  uses  http  post  to  send  the  data  to  the  server.  each  call  needs  to  be  authenticated  with  a  userid/userkey  pair  sent  along  with  the  http  post  headers,  for  every  call.  the  http  post  headers  must  also  contain  the  device  id:  device  id  the  device  id
__label__environmentmonitoring is  an  8  digit  hex  number  in  the  form  13xxxxxx.  13  is  the  device  class  and  is  immutable,  while  the  following  digits  are  the  device  number  and  are  unique  from  one  unit  to  another.  the  device  id  is  saved  in  the  eeprom  at  address  0,  using  4  bytes.  eeprom  on  startup,  the  device  reads  its  own  device  id  from  the  eeprom.  the  very  first  time,  the  device  number  will  be  0  invalid  but  the  device  class  will  be  added  13000000.  every  minute,  the  temperature  sensor  is  read,  and  a  http  post  is  issued  to  the  server.  if  the  server  receives
__label__environmentmonitoring an  invalid  device  id  like  13000000,  it  will  allocate  a  new  valid  device  id  and  will  return  it  as  a  response  to  the  http  post  in  json  format.  the  iot  device  will  parse  the  response,  and  if  a  device  id  is  received,  it  will  store  it  to  the  eeprom  so  on  the  next  call  will  report  with  a  valid  device  id.  owner  authentication  each  device  belongs  to  an  owner,  identified  with  a  user  id  /  user  key  pair.  you  will  need  to  register  a  user  account  on  the  .  the  user  id  /  user  key  pair  needs  to  be  sent
__label__environmentmonitoring out  with  each  http  post  call.  the  sensor  data  each  http  post  calls  a  restful  api  on  the  server.  the  format  is:  ,  followed  by  a  variable  number  of  keyvalue  pairs  separated  by  slash  sign  /.  each  key  identifies  a  specific  sensor  parameters,  as  per  the  following  list:  to  report  a  temperature  reading,  the  http  post  call  url  must  be:  reporting  the  time  with  01  is  compulsory.  the  code  becomes:  the  automated  device  id  allocation  means  the  same  code  can  be  installed  on  multiple  devices,  and  they  will  be  individually  addressable  via  their  distinct  device  ids.  once  connected,  the  device
__label__environmentmonitoring will  start  uploading  measurements  automatically,  and  these  can  be  accessed  via  in  numerical  form,  or  charts  can  be  seen  on  the  .  to  open  a  specific  device  id,  you  can  use  where  the  parameter  needs  to  be  a  valid  device  id.  here  are  the  measurements  taken  by  the  assembled  device:  this  simple  construction  illustrates  the  iot  concept  and  provides  a  solid  base  for  expanding  to  more  complicated  sensors.  the  exp  protocol  can  be  used  to  add  additional  readings  to  the  simple  iot  device,  including  sensors  for  co2  or  pm2.5.  since  the  simple  iot  device  runs  on  a  battery,  power  consumption
__label__environmentmonitoring can  be  implemented  in  the  code,  turning  the  esp8266  radio  off  to  save  power,  and  only  reconnecting  before  data  upload.  a  good  approach  is  to  have  it  take  measurements  every  3060  minutes  and  sleep  in  between.  there  are  four  types  of  sleep  modes  for  the  esp8266:  nosleep,  modemsleep,  lightsleep,  and  deepsleep.  they  all  have  different  functions  and  different  current  cost:  nosleep  modemsleep:  lightsleep:  deepsleep:  you  can  use  the  deepsleep  mode  to  have  the  esp8266  go  idle  when  measurements  are  not  needed  .  you  can  take  temperature  readings  every  60minutes  and  have  the  wemos  d1  go  to  sleep  in  between.  then
__label__environmentmonitoring on  wakeup,  make  sure  the  connection  is  up  before  retransmitting.  the  logic  is  as  follows:  the  sleep  time  is  specified  in  microseconds  s,  and  you  can  call  it  with:  ,  you  will  need  to  configure  your  wifi  settings  in  the  code,  the  apssid  and  apkey  .  code  mirror  .  i  did  a  workshop  on  simple  iot  at  the  balccon2k17  in  novi  sad,  now  at  its  fifth  edition:  the  participants  received  tens  of  kits  to  assemble  including  some  soldering  their  simple  iot  devices,  a  cube  like  unit  that  runs  on  battery,  measures  temperature  and  sends  all  data  online  via  wifi.  the

__label__environmentmonitoring sensors  are  small  pieces  of  hardware  which  enable  the  internet  of  things  by  monitoring  processes,  collecting  huge  amounts  of  data  and  taking  several  measurements.  the  falling  prices  of  these  sensors  is  helping  drive  down  iot  deployment  costs  and  is  enabling  an  increasing  number  of  use  cases  in  the  iot  space.  there  are  specific  sensors  for  each  iot  use  case,  depending  on  the  requirements  of  the  installation.  there  are  sensors  for  measuring  temperature,  pressure  and  others  to  monitor  the  quality  of  the  air  or  of  waters.  we  will  take  a  look  at  several  different  types  of  sensors  and  their  corresponding  use
__label__environmentmonitoring cases.  these  sensors  can  be  utilized  in  nearly  every  iot  environment,  from  the  factory  floor  to  agricultural  fields.  in  manufacturing,  temperature  sensors  can  continually  measure  the  temperature  of  a  machine  to  ensure  it  stays  within  a  secure  threshold.  in  agriculture,  these  sensors  are  deployed  to  track  the  temperature  of  soil,  water  and  plants  to  maximize  output.  these  sensors  can  also  be  used  in  healthrelated  iot  projects.  contact  temperature  sensors  are  required  to  be  in  physical  contact  with  the  object  being  sensed  and  use  conduction  to  monitor  changes  in  temperature.  they  can  be  used  to  detect  solids,  liquids  or  gases  over
__label__environmentmonitoring a  wide  range  of  temperatures.  meanwhile,  noncontact  temperature  sensors  use  convection  and  radiation  to  monitor  changes  in  temperature.  these  sensors  are  able  to  detect  the  presence  of  nearby  objects  or  persons  without  any  physical  contact.  these  sensors  detect  motion  and  are  frequently  used  in  a  retail  setting.  retailers  can  use  a  customers  proximity  to  a  product  to  send  deals  and  coupons  directly  to  their  smartphone.  proximity  sensors  can  also  be  used  to  monitor  the  availability  of  parking  spaces  in  large  venues  like  airports,  malls  and  stadiums.  also,  proximity  sensors  are  used  in  manufacturing  environments  such  as  beverages  and  food  can

__label__environmentmonitoring the  internet  of  things  couldnt  exist  without  smart  sensors.  while  the  use  of  sensor  technology  has  long  affected  how  manufacturers,  industrial  organizations  and  utilities  operate,  the  addition  of  to  sensors  has  expanded  their  impact  and  use  cases,  bringing  more  connectivity  and  analytics  to  processes  than  ever  before.  today,  smart  factories,  smart  cities,  smart  buildings  and  connected  individuals  are  using  an  array  of  smart  sensors  to  collect  realtime  data  for  realtime  insights  and  decisionmaking.  however,  these  arent  your  grandfathers  sensors.  they  may  collect  some  of  the  same  data  as  the  sensors  of  yesteryear,  but  todays  smart  sensors  are  internetenabled  and  more
__label__environmentmonitoring sophisticated  than  ever.  lets  dive  into  how  smart  sensors  work  and  their  use  cases  across  various  verticals.  in  general,  a  smart  sensor  has  three  major  components:  a  sensor  that  captures  data  from  an  environment;  a  ,  which  computes  on  the  output  of  the  sensor  via  programming;  and  communications  capabilities  that  enable  the  sensor  to  communicate  the  microprocessors  output  for  action.  a  smart  sensor  may  include  multiple  types  of  sensors  see  sidebar,  as  well  as  transducers,  transceivers,  amplifiers,  analog  filters  and  a  power  source,  among  other  components.  to  be  most  effective,  internet  of  things  sensors  should  include  wireless  communications,  be  smart
__label__environmentmonitoring enough  to  compute  data  remotely  and  be  programmable  to  accommodate  new  capabilities  as  needed,  said  institute  of  electrical  and  electronics  engineers  senior  member  shawn  chandler.  sensors  for  use  in  iot  may  be  purposed  for  nearly  any  form  of  measurement,  providing  a  mechanism  that  links  desired  observations  from  the  field  to  an  application,  chandler  said.  to  categorize  sensors,  he  said,  think  of  them  in  terms  of  the  physics  domains.  smart  sensors  serve  three  broad  purposes.  first,  they  provide  greater  visibility  into  existing  processes  and  workflows,  identifying  items,  locating  them  and  determining  their  environmental  conditions.  for  example,  smart  sensors  in  environments  can
__label__environmentmonitoring keep  track  of  temperature  and  humidity,  can  log  data  for  historical  records  and  quality  management,  or  can  be  used  as  triggers  for  alarms  or  process  management  in  plants  or  warehouses.  second,  iot  sensors  can  be  embedded  into  products  to  improve  processes  or  the  products  themselves.  in  the  manufacturing  process,  sensors  can  monitor,  control  and  improve  operations  or  be  to  streamline  how  products  are  delivered.  when  embedded  in  devices,  smart  products  can  create  new  revenue  possibilities.  third,  the  lower  cost  and  more  advanced  capabilities  of  sensors  enable  wider  and  more  effective  use  cases.  the  cost  of  physical  sensors  and  rfid  tags
__label__environmentmonitoring has  dropped  considerably,  as  have  the  costs  of  smart  sensor  software  applications,  connectivity  options  and  deployments.  the  three  use  cases  of  iot  sensors  outlined  above  lead  to  three  categories  of  benefits,  said  paul  miller,  a  senior  analyst  at  forrester  research.  first,  the  increased  visibility  iot  sensors  provide  into  existing  workflows  and  processes  enable  companies  to  see  where  things  are  thanks  to  realtime  data.  for  example,  logistics  companies  can  outfit  their  fleet  of  vehicles  with  sensors  to  detect  the  location  of  each  truck.  as  companies  begin  to  mine  data  from  those  sensors,  miller  said,  the  second  benefit  emerges:  predicting  what  comes
__label__environmentmonitoring next.  in  the  same  logistics  example,  collecting  realtime  data  about  where  a  fleet  has  been  and  how  long  trucks  take  to  complete  their  routes  can  enable  the  company  to  predict  when  drivers  will  deliver  packages.  smart  sensors  in  logistics  can  also  gather  information  about  a  drivers  driving  style  and  the  size  and  weight  of  packages,  as  well  as  external  data,  such  as  traffic  or  weather  conditions  that  may  affect  delivery.  now  you  build  a  rich  and,  hopefully,  accurate  model  that  can  be  used  to  improve  communication  with  customers,  optimize  loading  and  routing,  or  reduce  costs  and  emissions,  miller  said.  in
__label__environmentmonitoring another  example,  smart  sensors  in  manufacturing  can  collect  historical  machine  data  that  companies  can  use  to  build  models  to  predict  when  machine  components  are  likely  to  fail.  instead  of  facing  the  potentially  huge  cost  of  unplanned  downtime  for  a  production  line  or  factory,  suspect  components  can  be  proactively  replaced  during  scheduled  periods  of  time,  miller  said.  the  third  benefit  of  smart  sensors  relates  to  ;  iot  creates  a  number  of  new  business  models.  with  data  about  how  a  machine  operates,  how  it  is  used  and  how  it  wears  out,  manufacturers  can  offer  to  customers,  miller  said.  manufacturers  can  now  include
__label__environmentmonitoring consumables,  servicing  and  even  replacement  parts  in  the  price  of  a  machine.  companies  like  kaeser  compressor  in  germany,  which  traditionally  made  and  sold  compressed  air  machines,  are  now  able  to  offer  and  charge  customers  by  the  liter  of  compressed  air  consumed,  miller  said.  consumables,  spare  parts,  servicing  and  even  the  machine  itself  are  only  paid  for  when  theyre  needed  and  used.  rfid  tags  are  iot  sensors  that  collect  data  about  the  specific  object  to  which  a  tag  is  attached.  commonly  used  in  supply  chain  management,  id  badging  and  access  control,  involves  sending  data  using  specific  radio  wave  emissions.  rfid  has
__label__environmentmonitoring two  forms,  chandler  said:  active  and  passive.  an  active  rfid  tag  contains  an  onboard  power  supply,  enabling  a  tag  to  communicate  data  at  any  time  and  over  larger  distances.  a  passive  rfid  tag  may  not  communicate  unless  it  is  activated  by  a  radio  frequency  emission.  it  then  uses  the  radio  wave  captured  by  the  antenna  in  the  tag  to  activate  data  collection  and  power  the  return  communication  path.  forrester  research  predicts  that  smart  sensorbased,  trackandtrace  and  smart  products  will  be  the  fastestgrowing  use  cases,  with  24.2  and  24  compound  annual  growth  rates  respectively.  but  the  applications  wont  stop  there.  sensors
__label__environmentmonitoring are  increasingly  being  built  into  products  at  the  point  of  manufacture,  miller  said.  industrial  equipment,  trains,  planes  and  buildings  increasingly  arrive  with  hundreds  or  even  thousands  of  sensors  already  connected.  however,  internet  of  things  sensors  arent  limited  to  only  new  products.  in  markets  like  industrial  manufacturing,  where  machines  may  have  a  life  span  measured  in  decades,  theres  also  a  healthy  market  in  to  older  equipment,  miller  said,  noting  that  lowered  sensor  costs  combined  with  the  growing  prevalence  of  infrastructure  that  can  support  iot  data  flows  will  result  in  companies  deploying  sensors  in  greater  numbers.  where  today,  a  logistics  company  might
__label__environmentmonitoring install  sensors  in  a  truck,  tomorrow  it  may  be  costeffective  to  install  sensors  in  every  pallet  or  even  every  package,  miller  said.  the  arrival  of  5g,  he  added,  will  eventually  make  it  easier  to  work  with  a  large  number  of  sensors,  even  in  environments  where  data  latency  causes  problems  today.  also  of  note  is  the  increased  use  of  edge  computing.  as  more  analytics,  including  the  use  of  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence,  is  ,  organizations  or  the  sensors  themselves  or  the  iot  edge  gateways  the  sensors  connect  to  will  be  able  to  make  decisions  faster  and  more  effectively.  chandler  noted
__label__environmentmonitoring that  the  continued  miniaturization  of  sensors  will  change  the  future  sensor  landscape.  sensors  will  continue  to  get  smaller  over  time  and  more  capable  in  terms  of  computational  capability,  he  said.  sensors  will  also  offer  more  functions  in  the  same  platform,  serving  different  sensing  categories  from  the  same  devices.  sensors  will  be  installed  in  more  and  more  devices,  with  everything  from  wearables  to  specialpurpose  sensors  linking  observations  from  our  environment  to  a  computing  platform,  chandler  said.  estimates  from  pundits  in  the  industry  expect  that  the  total  number  of  iot  devices  and,  thus,  possible  sensors  will  triple  in  the  next  six  years,

__label__environmentmonitoring sponsored  channels  sensors  are  the  troops  of  the  internet  of  things,  the  ontheground  pieces  of  hardware  doing  the  critical  work  of  monitoring  processes,  taking  measurements  and  collecting  data.  they  are  often  one  of  the  first  things  people  think  of  when  picturing  iot.  the  decreasing  price  of  these  tiny  devices  is  helping  keep  iot  deployment  costs  low  and  enabling  a  myriad  of  use  cases.  but  not  every  sensor  is  made  the  same  and  every  iot  installation  requires  a  specific  type  of  sensor.  we  will  take  a  look  at  several  different  sensor  flavors  and  their  corresponding  use  cases.  these  devices  can  be
__label__environmentmonitoring used  in  nearly  every  iot  environment,  from  the  factory  floor  to  agricultural  fields.  in  manufacturing,  these  sensors  can  continually  measure  the  temperature  of  a  machine  to  ensure  it  stays  within  a  secure  threshold.  on  the  farm,  they  are  used  to  track  the  temperature  of  soil,  water  and  plants  to  maximize  output.  these  sensors  detect  motion  and  are  frequently  used  in  a  retail  setting.  a  retailer  can  use  a  customers  proximity  to  a  product  to  send  deals  and  coupons  directly  to  their  smartphone.  proximity  sensors  can  also  be  used  to  monitor  the  availability  of  parking  spaces  in  large  venues  like  airports,

__label__environmentmonitoring proposed  was  tested  in  a  real  scenario  using  a  prototype  system,  integrated  by  nodes  and  sensors,  specifically  designed  and  developed  to  gather  the  environmental  data  of  interest.  the  results  obtained  demonstrate  that  with  the  developed  system  it  is  possible  to  obtain,  process,  and  store  environmental  information.  additionally,  the  analysis  performed  over  the  gathered  data  using  machine  learning  and  pattern  recognition  mechanisms  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  determine  the  occupancy  of  indoor  environments.  the  internet  of  things  iot  paradigm  enables  the  interaction  between  physical  objects  via  application  services  to  add  characteristics  such  as  network  connectivity,  sensing,  and  actuation  allowing  to
__label__environmentmonitoring move  forward  to  the  smart  objects  approach.  thus,  smart  objects  can  communicate  with  each  other,  share  information,  and  coordinate  their  actions  in  order  to  take  smart  and  cognitive  decisions  according  to  the  environment  where  they  are  deployed  .  combining  the  iot  paradigm  and  the  smart  objects  approach,  the  concept  of  smart  city  arose.  a  smart  city  uses  a  variety  of  sensors  and  smart  objects  embedded  on  traditional  things  and  locations  e.g.,  buildings,  parks,  and  sidewalks  to  improve  the  citizens  quality  of  life.  one  of  the  smart  cities  sectors  is  smart  environments,  and  its  definition  is  given  by  cook  et  al.
__label__environmentmonitoring a  smart  environment  can  acquire  and  apply  knowledge  about  the  surroundings  and  its  inhabitants  to  improve  their  experience  in  that  ambiance  .  smart  environments  have  become  popular  in  recent  years  targeting  the  automation  of  everyday  tasks  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of  life.  a  typical  example  of  this  kind  of  systems  is  the  management  of  energy  consumption  and  heat  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  hvac  ,  in  smart  buildings.  for  the  previous  particular  use  case,  it  is  essential  to  know  the  occupancy  estimation  of  specific  areas  in  order  to  trigger  the  proper  actions  to  minimise  consumption  during  periods  of  vacancy,
__label__environmentmonitoring optimise  ventilation  dynamically  for  occupant  comfort,  or  forecast  of  longterm  behaviors.  to  empower  the  smart  environment  approach,  the  use  of  learning  mechanisms  plays  a  key  role  to  analyse  patterns,  predict  situations,  and  take  decisions/actions.  thus,  new  terms  such  as  ambient  intelligence  ami  arise  in  this  context.  ami  brings  intelligence  to  our  everyday  environments,  making  them  sensitive  to  us.  amis  primary  goal  is  to  introduce  automation  into  the  environment  to  generate  knowledge  about  the  users  and  their  surroundings,  accumulating  data  and  taking  smart  and  cognitive  decisions  .  making  these  environments  smarter,  we  can  make  the  life  of  their  occupants  simpler  and
__label__environmentmonitoring more  automated.  a  specific  research  topic  framed  in  the  context  of  a  smart  environment  is  focused  on  looking  at  people,  detecting,  tracking  and  identifying  them,  as  a  way  to  offer  highquality,  intelligent  services,  while  considering  human  factors  such  as  life  patterns,  health,  and  mood  of  a  person  .  one  example  is  to  analyse  patterns  of  an  elderly  person  and  generate  an  alert  when  something  abnormal  happens.  for  this,  knowing  the  places  occupancy  is  a  priority.  many  techniques  are  developed  to  detect  the  presence  of  people,  the  most  common  are  cameras  and  wearable  devices.  however,  these  devices  suffer  from  privacy  or
__label__environmentmonitoring intrusiveness  issues.  research  challenges  arise  with  the  design  of  occupancy  detection  techniques.  one  of  these  challenges  is  related  to  how  to  preserve  occupants  privacy.  a  smart  environment  system  should  be  designed  to  avoid  identifying  occupants  or  their  activities.  thus,  there  is  the  need  for  nonintrusive  techniques  to  detect  occupancy  or  improve  the  mechanisms  already  available.  environmental  data  are  an  excellent  source  of  information  for  occupancy  detection  since  the  presence  of  living  beings  affects  the  surroundings  through  heat  or  carbon  dioxide  co  emission  without  jeopardising  the  privacy  of  the  occupants  in  that  particular  location.  nevertheless,  only  with  data,  it  is  almost
__label__environmentmonitoring impossible  to  gauge  something.  machine  learning  ml  techniques  look  at  the  data  and  try  to  find  patterns;  with  these  patterns,  it  is  possible  to  affirm  the  occupancy  with  a  certain  percentage  of  certainty.  although  some  contributions  have  been  performed  in  this  direction,  there  is  still  room  for  improvement,  and  this  research  proposal  is  focused  on  that.  the  main  purpose  of  this  research  is  the  design  and  development  of  an  affordable  and  nonintrusive  solution  to  improve  occupants  experience  in  smart  environments  with  ml  support.  the  proposed  solution  monitors  temperature,  light  intensity,  noise,  and  co  to  estimate  the  presence  of  occupants  through
__label__environmentmonitoring these  environmental  features  that  can  be  integrated  with  other  existent  approaches.  first,  the  data  are  collected  and  analysed,  before  applying  ml  techniques  to  infer  the  occupancy  of  the  area  under  monitoring.  in  the  first  stage,  our  solution  detects  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants.  in  the  second  stage,  the  number  of  occupants  inside  the  area  of  interest  is  estimated.  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  discusses  the  related  work.  presents  the  solution  developed  to  detect  occupants,  its  architecture,  and  the  key  features  that  were  considered,  the  gathering  system  and  the  ml  concerns.  shows  the  experimental  implementation.  analyses  and  discusses  the
__label__environmentmonitoring results  obtained.  finally,  conclusions  are  presented  in  as  well  as  suggestions  for  future  works.  occupancy  detection  systems  could  be  classified  according  to  the  need  to  use  a  terminal  or  not  ,  .  in  the  case  of  the  methods  that  require  a  terminal,  it  is  necessary  to  attach  a  device  to  the  occupants  to  keep  track  of  them  e.g.,  a  smartphone.  in  the  nonterminal  methods,  the  detection  is  based  on  a  passive  approach  that  is  focused  on  monitoring  areas  or  spaces  instead  of  the  identification  of  devices  e.g.,  cameras  monitoring  a  room.  depicts  a  simple  classification  of  the  occupancy  detection  methods
__label__environmentmonitoring following  the  terminal  and  nonterminal  approaches,  and  their  more  specific  characterisations,  which  are  used  to  organise  the  discussion  of  this  section.  a  simple  classification  of  occupancy/location  detection  methods.  in  the  branch  of  terminals,  the  methods  for  occupancy  and  counting  lay  on  devices  that  have  embedded  wireless  transmitters  which  support  different  communication  technologies,  such  as,  radiofrequency  identification  rfid,  wifi  and  bluetooth,  or  global  positioning  system  gps  in  the  case  of  wearable  devices.  on  the  other  hand,  the  branch  of  nonterminals  relies  on  monitoring  specific  surroundings  by  using  cameras,  smart  meters  for  energy  consumption,  or  environmental  sensors  e.g.,  co  and  temperature.  a
__label__environmentmonitoring discussion  of  some  relevant  works  on  occupancy  detection  is  presented  below.  hahnel  et  al.  proposed  a  probabilistic  measurement  model  for  rfid  readers  that  allows  accurately  tracking  rfid  tags  in  the  environment;  specifically,  the  authors  studied  the  problem  of  localising  the  rfid  tags  using  a  mobile  platform  based  in  robots  equipped  with  rfid  antennas.  li  and  becerikgerber  performed  a  survey  of  rfidbased  solutions  and  the  algorithms  used  for  occupancy  and  location  at  indoor  environments.  after  discussing  more  than  twenty  projects,  authors  identify  the  drawbacks  of  each  solution  to  move  forward  to  the  identification  of  the  most  relevant  research  challenges  regarding  outdoor/indoor
__label__environmentmonitoring location  sensing  solutions.  in  a  followup  research,  li  et  al.  proposed  an  energysaving  strategy  for  smart  buildings  based  on  rfid  occupancy  detection  to  support  demanddriven  hvac  operation  by  detecting  and  tracking  occupants  around  areas  of  interest  inside  the  buildings.  the  use  of  rfid  technologies  for  occupancy  detection  is  an  affordable  option  considering  the  price  of  receptors  and  tags;  nonetheless,  this  approach  could  be  affected  by  electric  and  magnetic  conditions  of  the  environment  leading  to  inaccurate  occupancy  detection.  a  more  constraining  issue  is  the  fact  that  occupants  have  to  carry  a  special  tag  to  be  monitored,  making  the  process  invasive  and
__label__environmentmonitoring susceptible  to  additional  errors  in  case  the  occupants  forget  their  specific  devices  somewhere.  some  occupation  detection  methods  take  advantage  of  the  communication  technologies  embedded  in  devices  commonly  used  by  the  occupants  of  the  area  of  interest,  such  as  smartphones,  smartwatches,  and  fitness  trackers.  huh  and  seo  came  up  with  a  system  that  estimates  the  indoor  position  of  a  user  taking  advantage  of  some  specific  characteristics  of  the  bluetooth  protocol.  specifically,  the  system  uses  beacon  frames  to  extract  information  about  the  received  signal  strength  indication  rssi  and  trilateration  that  is  processed  to  infer  indoor  positioning.  filippoupolitis  et  al.  evaluated  how  accurate
__label__environmentmonitoring occupancy  estimation  in  indoor  environments  using  bluetooth  low  energy  ble  could  be  in  a  prototype  system  composed  of  ble  beacons,  a  mobile  application,  and  a  server.  after  performing  the  analysis  of  the  data  collected  using  three  ml  approaches  i.e.,  knearest  neighbors,  logistic  regression,  and  support  vector  machine,  the  authors  concluded  that  the  combination  of  ble  and  ml  leads  to  a  good  occupancy  estimation.  depatla  et  al.  proposed  a  framework  for  counting  the  total  number  of  people  walking  in  an  area  based  on  the  wifi  rssi  measurements  between  a  pair  of  transmitter/receiver  antennas.  the  authors  developed  a  mathematical  model  to  determine
__label__environmentmonitoring the  probability  distribution  of  the  received  signal  amplitude  as  a  function  of  the  total  number  of  occupants  based  on  kullbackleiber  divergence  estimation.  the  results  obtained  concluded  the  authors  approach  could  estimate  the  total  number  of  people  in  indoor  and  outdoor  areas  with  good  accuracy.  balaji  et  al.  designed  a  system,  sentinel,  that  leverages  in  the  wifi  infrastructure  deployed  in  the  area  of  interest  along  with  smartphone  carried  by  occupants  to  estimate  occupancy  and  enhance  the  performance  of  the  hvac  system  via  actuation.  the  sentinel  system  proposed  by  the  authors  shows  an  accuracy  of  86,  with  6.2  false  negative  error  regarding
__label__environmentmonitoring the  occupancy  in  indoor  environments.  additionally,  the  tests  performed  depict  that  using  actuation  over  the  hvac  system  it  was  possible  to  save  around  17.8  energy.  wearable  electronics,  such  as  smartwatches  and  fitness  trackers  are  becoming  more  ubiquitous  and  carrying  more  sensors  and  communication  interfaces.  jin  et  al.  took  advantage  of  the  previous  statement  to  investigate  the  causal  influence  of  user  activity  on  various  environmental  parameters  monitored  by  occupantcarried  multipurpose  sensors.  their  results  showed  that  the  fusion  of  the  data  collected  from  the  sensors  available  in  the  wearable  devices  e.g.,  light  level,  accelerometer,  heart  rate,  bluetooth,  and  gps  achieves  a  good
__label__environmentmonitoring classification  regarding  occupancy/location  reaching  in  some  cases  values  around  99  of  accuracy.  the  quality  of  data  obtained  using  the  method  that  involved  wearable  devices,  wifi  and  bluetooth  allows  a  more  accurate  occupancy/location  estimation;  however,  these  approaches  have  privacy  concerns  regarding  how  to  use  the  data  gathered.  for  example,  the  use  of  bluetooth  allows  having  access  to  specific  and  unique  information  of  the  devices,  such  as  the  mac  address;  or  in  the  case  of  a  fitness  tracker  the  heart  rate  histogram  could  reveal  some  particular  condition  or  disease.  this  information  could  be  crossed  with  other  data  to  obtain  detailed  information  about
__label__environmentmonitoring the  owner  of  the  device.  in  the  nonterminal  branch  for  occupancy/location,  the  methods  that  use  cameras  are  wellknown.  fleuret  et  al.  combined  a  generative  model  with  dynamic  programming  to  track  occlusions  and  lighting  changes  in  frame  images  in  order  to  derive  the  trajectories  of  each  of  them.  with  the  proposed  model,  authors  were  able  to  track  multiple  persons  and  ranked  their  trajectories  inside  the  area  under  study.  alahi  et  al.  addressed  the  problem  of  localising  people  in  crowds  using  a  network  of  heterogeneous  cameras  by  formulating  a  problem  focused  on  calculating  the  occupancy  vector  per  each  captured  frame;  this  is
__label__environmentmonitoring the  discretised  occupancy  of  people  on  the  ground  from  the  foreground  silhouettes.  the  occupancy  approach  proposed  is  complemented  by  a  graphdriven  tracking  procedure  suited  to  deal  with  the  temporal  dynamics  of  people  occupancy  vectors.  the  main  outcome  of  this  work  is  a  welldefined  mathematical  formulation  to  locate  people  via  cameras  that  record  frames  with  very  noisy  features.  in  the  same  way  as  with  the  wearable  solutions  discussed  above,  the  use  of  cameras  for  occupancy/location  brings  a  set  of  privacy  issues  regarding  the  identity  of  occupants  and  objects  that  could  represent  a  problem  in  the  final  solution.  a  different  solution  based
__label__environmentmonitoring on  smart  meters  is  presented  by  chen  et  al.  .  they  tried  to  predict  the  occupancy  analysing  electrical  usage.  they  observed  that  the  homes  pattern  of  electricity  usage  changes  when  there  are  occupants.  the  study  was  carried  out  in  two  homes  and  later  on  correlated  with  statistical  data  e.g.,  powers  mean  and  variance.  some  challenges  on  nonintrusive  occupancy  monitoring  are  also  discussed.  another  solution  by  lee  et  al.  used  an  array  of  pyroelectric  infrared  sensors  pir  to  detect  residents  location  in  a  smart  home.  the  authors  also  proposed  an  algorithm  to  analyse  the  information  collected  from  the  pir  sensors.  the
__label__environmentmonitoring evaluation  was  carried  out  using  an  experimental  testbed.  jin  et  al.  tested  several  binary  techniques  using  data  from  residential  and  commercial  buildings  based  on  information  regarding  power  usage  that  requires  minimal  system  calibration  and  setup,  while  also  ensuring  the  privacy  of  the  occupants.  the  accuracy  of  these  works  to  determine  the  number  of  occupants  is  low  and  could  be  considered  just  an  estimation  since  the  power  consumption  is  aggregated,  consequently,  the  exact  number  of  people  occupying  the  area  of  interest  could  not  be  accurate.  the  results  of  dong  et  al.  indicate  that  co  and  acoustic  parameters  have  the  most  significant
__label__environmentmonitoring correlation  with  the  number  of  occupants  in  a  space.  several  studies  correlate  the  co  concentrations  with  the  presence  of  occupants  such  as  in  the  research  of  gruber  et  al.  .  ryu  et  al.  used  indoor  and  outdoor  co  concentrations  and  electricity  consumptions  of  lighting  systems  in  a  controlled  testbed.  although  the  co  levels  could  be  used  to  determine  occupancy,  gathering  this  kind  of  data  with  good  levels  of  accuracy  is  not  an  easy  task  considering  that  aspects  such  as  room  ventilation,  room  flowrate,  and  presence  of  plants  in  the  room  could  drastically  influence  the  concentration  and  dissipation  of  the  aforementioned
__label__environmentmonitoring gas.  thus,  it  is  not  feasible  to  only  use  co  as  a  metric  for  occupancy  estimation.  candanedo  et  al.  and  amayri  estimated  occupancy  using  a  combination  of  heterogeneous  sensors.  the  first  research  uses  data  from  light,  temperature,  humidity  and  co  sensors;  and  the  second  one  uses  data  from  luminance,  temperature,  humidity,  motion  detection,  power  consumption,  and  co  ,  as  well  as  data  collected  from  a  microphone  or  door/window  burglary  sensors.  these  works  follow  the  same  ground  truth  strategy  focused  on  cameras  to  corroborate  the  presence  of  occupants,  which  introduce  several  privacy  constraints.  additionally,  both  works  utilise  ml  techniques  to  evaluate
__label__environmentmonitoring the  results  of  the  proposed  solutions,  particularly,  decision  tree  learning  algorithms.  considering  the  number  of  sensors  and  devices  used  in  these  studies  were  significantly  high,  our  proposal  is  focused  on  answering  the  question  whether  it  is  possible  to  obtain  similar  or  better  results  regarding  occupancy  detection  using  fewer  resources.  even  more,  our  proposal  uses  a  nonintrusive  ground  truth  strategy  to  avoid  jeopardising  the  privacy  and  security  of  the  occupants  in  the  area  of  interest.  this  research  uses  as  inspiration  some  of  the  ideas  proposed  in  the  works  discussed,  in  particular,  the  gathering  of  data  from  different  sources  to  move  forward
__label__environmentmonitoring to  a  complete  analysis  of  the  data  collected  using  a  ml  approach.  our  goal  is  to  detect  occupancy  in  indoor  environments  by  preprocessing  the  datasets  collected  before  applying  ml  to  a  binary  and  multiclass  problem.  additionally,  we  design  our  solution  focused  on  two  main  requirements:  the  first  one  is  to  try  to  take  advantage  of  cheap/affordable  devices  commonly  deployed  in  smart  environment,  and  the  second  one  is  to  guarantee  that  the  privacy  of  the  occupants  in  the  area  under  study  would  not  be  compromised.  thus,  after  the  discussion  of  the  works  in  this  research  area,  our  proposal  uses  environmental  features
__label__environmentmonitoring via  the  combination  of  data  gathered  from  different  sensors.  this  solution  is  presented  in  the  following  section.  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  occupancy  detection  could  be  used  to  trigger  some  actuation  mechanisms  in  smart  environments  in  order  to  improve  resource  usage  and  user  experience,  among  other  factors.  an  important  issue  that  must  be  considered  is  the  preservation  of  privacy  of  the  data  collected  and  analysed.  additionally,  it  would  be  desirable  to  take  advantage  of  the  infrastructure  available  in  the  surroundings  to  avoid  incurring  in  extra  expenses,  while  allowing  the  scalability  of  the  solution.  considering  these  factors,  this  research  is
__label__environmentmonitoring focused  on  a  nonintrusive  and  inexpensive  solution  for  occupancy  estimation  that  ensures  occupants  privacy  while  taking  advantage  of  the  technological  infrastructure  already  available  in  common  smart  environments  including  smart  buildings  and  smart  homes.  from  the  analysis  performed  on  ,  and  to  comply  with  the  previously  established  requirements,  our  occupancy  detection  solution  is  focused  on  environmental  data.  a  scene  analysis  approach  is  used  in  this  research  to  extract  the  features  of  interest  for  indoor  scenarios  to  proceed  and  then  to  estimate  the  occupancy  in  the  area  using  the  gathered  data  .  the  scene  analysis  method  does  not  rely  on  any  theoretical

__label__environmentmonitoring equivalent  to  the  heat  dissipated  by  a  few  laptops  .  thus,  the  heat  of  an  environment  is  influenced  by  the  number  of  persons  in  there.  similar  to  heat,  co  is  a  side  effect  of  the  metabolism.  it  is  an  essential  gas  for  the  existence  of  life,  but  at  very  high  concentrations  e.g.,  greater  than  5000  parts  per  million  ppm  it  can  pose  a  health  risk.  co  concentrations  commonly  found  in  buildings  are  not  a  direct  health  risk,  but  this  concentration  can  be  used  as  an  indicator  of  occupancy  .  in  fact,  occupants  are  the  principal  source  of  co  increasing  in
__label__environmentmonitoring indoor  environments  .  in  1879,  thomas  edison  invented  the  first  light  bulb  which  made  viable  to  extend  the  working  hours  of  the  human  beings  .  nowadays,  it  is  common  to  have  artificial  light  in  working  spaces.  this  fact  enables  the  possibility  of  drawing  a  relation  between  light  sources  and  occupancy  in  indoor  environments.  noise  is  another  feature  that  is  affected  by  the  number  of  human  beings  in  an  ambient  .  thus,  it  is  possible  to  expect  that  the  noise  of  a  specific  place  will  increase  with  the  number  of  people  there.  an  important  fact  that  should  be  considered  in  indoor
__label__environmentmonitoring environments  is  that  they  usually  have  background  noise  produced  by  household  appliances  or  other  static  sources  of  sound.  considering  the  discussion  and  facts  addressed  so  far  in  this  section,  this  research  uses  the  following  environmental  features  to  detect  and  estimate  the  occupancy  of  indoor  environments:  heat  via  the  measurement  of  the  temperature  in  the  area  of  interest,  co  ,  light  intensity,  and  noise.  specifically,  a  testbed  was  designed  to  acquire  the  data  and  extract  the  information  to  be  analysed  using  a  ml  approach.  in  the  next  subsection,  the  architecture  designed  and  used  to  process  the  data  gathered  from  the  features
__label__environmentmonitoring selected  in  this  work  is  presented.  the  data  processing  architecture  used  in  this  research  is  depicted  in  .  the  architecture  has  four  layers:  objects  layer,  communication  layer,  analysis  layer,  and  application  layer.  the  functionality  of  each  layer  is  presented  below:  objects  layer  :  deals  with  the  physical  sensors  that  collect  raw  data  information.  the  sensors  used  in  this  research  are  presented  in  .  sensors  used  in  the  objects  layer.  communication  layer  :  handles  the  data  coming  from  the  sensors.  in  this  layer,  the  following  components  are  used:  an  embedded  operating  system,  signal  processors,  microcontrollers,  and  gateway  nodes.  in  this  layer,
__label__environmentmonitoring the  communication  between  an  arduino  yun  a  microcontroller  board  based  on  the  atmega32u4  and  the  atheros  ar9331  and  the  sensors  e.g.,  thermistors  and  sound  sensors  is  carried  out  using  10  bits  adc  via  an  i2c  bus.  the  arduino  yun  communicates  with  a  raspberry  pi  rpi  by  serial  communication  performed  by  the  universal  serial  bus  usb  port  to  process  and  store  the  data  gathered.  analysis  layer  :  provides  the  data  management  required  to  extract  the  necessary  information  from  the  raw  data  collected  in  the  lower  layers.  this  layer  includes  the  elements  to  perform  data  mining,  analytics  services,  and  device  management.  the
__label__environmentmonitoring data  collected  and  analysed  are  stored  using  a  mysql  database  version  5.5.  the  tool  used  to  perform  the  analytics  of  the  data  was  matlab  version  v.9.2.r2017a.  application  layer  :  deals  with  the  utilisation  of  the  processed  data.  it  includes  services  and  applications.  this  last  layer  uses  the  previous  layers  to  acquire  raw  data  through  sensors,  storing  and  treating  it  to  apply  ml  techniques  to  perform  the  main  goal  of  this  research,  which  is  to  detect  people  in  indoor  environments  using  a  nonintrusive  approach.  data  processing  architecture.  the  flow  of  data  in  the  processing  architecture  begins  at  the  lower  level  with
__label__environmentmonitoring the  raw  data  acquisition  via  environmental  sensors.  specifically,  every  time  that  the  arduino  yun  receives  a  signal  from  the  rpi  every  10  s,  the  former  one  gets  ten  samples  with  a  delay  of  100  microseconds.  next,  an  average  is  computed  and  sent  to  the  rpi.  finally,  a  new  average  is  calculated  using  the  aggregated  data  of  six  values  and  it  is  stored  in  the  mysql  database.  with  this  average,  it  is  possible  to  decrease  the  fluctuations  in  the  data.  this  process  is  repeated  every  minute.  in  the  upper  layers  of  the  architecture,  the  analytic  functions  using  ml  are  run  over
__label__environmentmonitoring the  data  collected  and  stored  after  preprocessing  it.  thus,  the  outcome  of  the  application  layer  will  be  an  estimation  of  the  occupancy  of  the  indoor  area  under  study.  in  the  ml  context,  a  supervised  approach  is  used  to  process  the  data  so  the  system  could  learn  from  it.  we  use  three  classifiers:  logistic  regression  lr,  a  direct  probabilistic  interpretation;  support  vector  machine  svm,  a  hyperplane  with  the  maximal  margin  to  separate  the  data  with  similarities;  and  artificial  neural  network  ann,  a  classifier  inspired  by  how  the  human  brain  works.  for  the  ann  case,  the  hypothesis  function  is  obtained  by  processing
__label__environmentmonitoring the  input  features  via  a  set  of  activation  units.  these  classifiers  are  largely  used  in  classification  problems  ,  ,  .  the  purpose  of  using  these  three  classifiers  is  to  compare  and  select  the  best  classifier,  considering  the  specific  problem  and  the  features  involved.  some  parameters  can  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  classifier.  these  parameters  have  fix/default  value  results  under  the  same  conditions.  thus,  it  is  necessary  to  tweak  the  classifiers  parameters  according  the  problem  under  study  to  improve  the  results  obtained  during  the  analysis  of  the  data.  for  lr,  the  regularisation  parameter  and  the  degree  of  the  polynomial  were
__label__environmentmonitoring used.  in  the  case  of  svm,  we  applied  the  penalty  cost  c  ,  and  the  standard  deviation  parameter  .  for  ann,  the  number  of  hidden  layers  units  ,  and  the  previous  and  parameters  were  utilised.  regarding  the  default  cases,  for  lr,  a  sigmoid  function  with  threshold  equal  to  ,  ,  and  was  used.  for  svm,  a  radialbasis  function  rbf  kernel  was  used  in  conjunction  with  these  values  and  .  for  ann,  three  layers  input  layer,  hidden  layer,  and  output  layer  were  used,  and  the  following  values  were  set:  ,  ,  and  .  these  values  represent  the  base  cases  for  each
__label__environmentmonitoring classifier  before  proceeding  with  a  grid  search  during  the  training  phase  in  order  to  tweak  them  to  improve  the  performance  of  each  classifier.  for  lr,  the  possible  values  of  were  and  for  the  range  was  13.  for  svm,  values  were  ,  and  c  could  assume  .  finally,  for  ann,  could  take  the  following  values  ,  the  range  of  values  of  was  13,  and  could  assume  13.  to  select  the  default  and  improved  values  for  the  classifiers,  we  used  the  recommendations  of  clarke  et  al.  and  perez  et  al.  .  in  this  research,  two  problems  were  studied,  a  binary  problem,  where
__label__environmentmonitoring the  positive  case  is  the  presence  of  occupants  and  the  negative  case  is  the  absence  of  occupants,  and  a  multiclass  problem,  where  the  objective  is  to  determine  the  exact  number  of  occupants.  the  research  started  with  the  selection  of  the  features  to  estimate  the  occupancy  in  indoor  environments,  to  move  forward  to  the  design  of  the  fourlayers  data  processing  architecture  corresponding  to:  1  the  sensors  to  gather  the  data  concerning  the  features  selected;  2  the  communication  protocols  used  between  sensors,  microcontrollers,  and  processors;  3  how  to  preprocess  and  store  the  data;  and  4  the  analysis  of  the  data  collected  using
__label__environmentmonitoring a  ml  approach  where  the  different  classifiers  were  tested  in  order  to  determine  the  best  one  by  tweaking  their  parameters.  the  setup  of  the  testbed  used  in  this  work,  as  well  as  how  the  ml  classifiers  were  evaluated  according  to  their  performance  is  detailed  in  the  next  section.  the  experiments  were  conducted  in  a  room  of  the  laboratory  of  communications  and  telematicscentre  for  informatics  and  systems  located  in  the  middle  of  the  department  of  informatics  engineering  at  the  university  of  coimbra.  the  room  has  an  area  of  8.5  5.5  m  and  4.15  m  of  height.  this  room  has  a  small
__label__environmentmonitoring occupancy  change  the  maximum  number  of  occupants  is  five,  and  the  minimum  number  of  occupants  is  zero  and  very  low  ventilation.  the  only  ventilation  in  the  room  is  the  door  and  few  window  cracks.  the  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  equipment  were  off  during  the  time  of  the  tests  to  prevent  any  influence  on  the  data  collected,  and  it  was  assumed  that  the  occupants  kept  the  doors  and  windows  closed  and  the  lights  on  during  the  period  they  were  in  there.  this  testbed  was  set  up  to  study  occupancy  detection  in  indoor  environments  using  nonintrusive  sensors  and  ml  techniques.  the
__label__environmentmonitoring primary  objective  of  the  experiments  is  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  regarding  occupancy  detection  in  two  branches,  the  simplest  one  focuses  on  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants;  and  the  more  advanced  one  on  the  estimation  of  the  number  of  occupants.  in  the  remainder  of  this  section,  we  discuss  about  the  placement  of  the  nodes  to  collect  the  environmental  data  and  analysis  performed  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  classifier  utilised.  the  datasets  used  in  this  research,  as  well  as  the  source  code  used  in  the  nodes  e.g.,  arduinos  and  rpis  and  the  analysis  of  the  data  using  ml
__label__environmentmonitoring methods,  are  available  via  a  github  repository  .  three  gathering  and  processing  nodes  i.e.,  3  rpis  and  3  arduinos  were  placed  in  the  room  see  in  strategic  positions  to  collect  data.  shows  the  physical  location  of  the  nodes  in  the  area  under  study.  node  1  has  a  temperature  in  and  out  and  sound  sensors;  node  2  has  temperature,  co  and  sound  sensors;  and  node  3  has  the  most  significant  variety  of  sensors  including  temperature,  co  ,  sound,  and  light  intensity.  besides  gathering  environmental  data,  node  1  is  responsible  for  controlling  the  number  of  occupants  in  the  room  i.e.,  the  ground

__label__environmentmonitoring on  it  was  one  of  the  lamps.  regarding  the  temperature,  a  sensor  was  placed  in  the  hallway  and  other  sensors  inside  the  room.  the  difference  between  the  temperatures  gathered  at  these  two  different  places  was  analysed  to  estimate  the  occupancy  in  the  room.  a  ground  of  truth  approach  was  adopted  in  this  research  to  validate  the  data  gathered.  concretely,  in  this  work,  a  simple  mechanism  with  two  buttons  blue  to  enter  and  red  to  leave  was  developed  to  create  the  ground  truth  and  register  when  a  person  enters  or  leaves  the  room.  every  time  that  an  occupant  presses  one  of
__label__environmentmonitoring these  buttons,  the  counter  is  increased  or  decreased,  respectively.  to  visualise  if  the  number  of  occupants  is  correct,  three  led  were  introduced  as  a  binary  counter  occupants  in  the  room.  the  leftmost  led  is  the  most  significant  and  the  rightmost  led  is  the  least  significant.  the  number  of  total  occupants  by  minute  is  the  average  of  samples  acquired  every  10  s.  to  analyse  the  performance  of  the  classifiers,  several  criteria  were  used.  accuracy  measures  the  percentage  of  entries  that  were  correctly  classified  see  equation  ,  and  the  miss  rate  measures  the  percentage  of  entries  that  were  incorrectly  classified  see  equation
__label__environmentmonitoring .  true  positive  tp  and  true  negative  tn  represent  the  correct  classification/prediction  if  the  entry  belongs  to  the  positive  class  or  negative  class,  respectively.  false  negative  fn  and  false  positive  fp  represent  the  incorrect  classification/prediction  if  the  entry  does  not  belong  to  the  negative  and  positive  classes,  respectively  .  where  n  is  the  total  size  of  the  training  dataset.  to  evaluate  a  classifier,  it  is  necessary  to  verify  its  accuracy  when  it  has  to  process  new  data.  the  classifiers  can  have  a  high  accuracy  when  they  are  tested  with  the  training  dataset,  but  they  can  have  a  low  accuracy  with
__label__environmentmonitoring a  new  dataset.  thus,  it  is  recommended  to  split  the  data  into  a  training  dataset  and  a  testing  dataset  .  the  training  dataset  is  suitable  to  train  the  classifiers,  and  the  testing  dataset  is  appropriated  to  measure  their  performance  to  new  entries.  typically,  the  dataset  is  divided  into  three  portions:  training  to  train  the  classifiers,  crossvalidation  to  adjust  the  parameters,  and  testing  to  verify  the  performance  of  the  classifiers  ,  .  in  this  work,  the  dataset  used  was  split  following  the  same  approach,  particularly  for  the  cross  validation  the  kfold  method  with  was  used  .  in  certain  cases,  the  dataset
__label__environmentmonitoring can  have  skewed  classes,  i.e.,  one  class  has  a  small  set  of  data.  for  example,  assuming  that  the  training  dataset  contains  0  positive  and  100  negative  entries,  and  if  all  instances  are  predicted  correctly,  the  accuracy  will  be  100,  but  the  classifier  had  no  chance  of  learning  the  hidden  patterns.  with  the  previous  example,  it  can  be  said  that  the  accuracy  does  not  work  well  when  the  dataset  is  unbalanced,  i.e.,  it  has  more  data  in  one  class  than  in  the  other.  the  fscore  was  used  to  predict  the  performance  of  the  classifiers.  it  is  a  technique  that  measures  the
__label__environmentmonitoring discrimination  of  classes,  through  a  harmonic  mean  of  two  metrics,  recall  and  precision  see  equation  .  recall  measures  the  percentage  of  entries  that  belongs  to  the  positive  class  and  was  classified/predicted  correctly  see  equation  .  precision  measures  the  percentage  of  hits  over  the  entries  of  the  predicted  positive  class  that  really  belongs  to  positive  class  see  equation  .  to  have  a  high  fscore,  both  precision  and  recall  must  be  high.  equation  can  only  be  applied  to  binary  classification  problems,  but  it  can  be  extrapolated  to  a  multiclass  classification  problem.  the  macroaverage  method  takes  the  average  of  precision  and  recall  of
__label__environmentmonitoring each  class  label  see  equations  and  ,  .  where  k  is  the  class  label.  the  analysis  and  discussion  of  the  results  obtained  in  this  research  are  presented  in  the  next  section.  the  data  acquisition  for  this  research  was  performed  over  two  weeks  on  november  2017  using  a  rate  of  one  sample  per  minute.  first,  the  data  were  analysed  and  a  strategy  to  use  it  was  defined.  it  was  confirmed  that  some  data  had  outliers  and  noise;  consequently,  to  mitigate  this  issue,  two  filters  i.e.,  an  outlier  filter  and  a  lowpass  filter  lpf  were  applied.  the  performance  of  the  filters  over
__label__environmentmonitoring the  data  is  depicted  in  .  performance  of  the  outlier  and  lpf  filters  over  the  temperature  i.e.,  difference  of  outdoor  and  indoor  temperatures  data  gathered.  an  lpf  is  a  circuit  that  offers  easy  passage  to  lowfrequency  signals  and  difficult  passage  to  highfrequency  signals.  equation  gives  the  discrete  implementation  of  the  first  order  lpf,  where  is  the  smoothing  factor,  y  is  the  filtered  output,  x  is  the  input,  and  n  is  the  sample  index.  calculating  the  next  value  through  this  smoothing  factor  and  the  previous  value,  it  was  possible  to  reduce  the  data  noise,  making  the  transitions  between  samples  slower  and
__label__environmentmonitoring smoother.  in  a  second  stage,  ten  consecutive  days  of  data  were  selected,  representing  a  total  of  14,400  samples  where  almost  25  represented  positive  cases,  and  75  represented  negative  cases  for  each  dataset  and  the  ml  mechanisms  were  applied.  the  dataset  was  divided  into  two  portions,  training  and  testing.  the  training  portion  was  then  subdivided  into  two  portions,  training  and  crossvalidation  portions,  respectively,  representing  70  of  the  original  dataset  and  the  remaining  30  corresponds  to  a  testing  portion.  within  the  first  portion  i.e.,  training  80  was  used  for  training  and  20  was  used  for  crossvalidation  according  to  the  kfold  with  a
__label__environmentmonitoring approach  to  prevent  overfitting  .  this  value  for  was  selected  given  the  unbalanced  nature  of  our  dataset,  where  the  average  occupancy  was  around  8  h  per  day  that  corresponds  to  office  hours;  thus,  having  periods  of  16  h  without  relevant  data  per  day.  using  this  value  i.e.,  ,  we  minimise  the  probability  of  having  kportions  without  any  relevant  data.  in  the  remaining  of  the  section,  a  discussion  about  how  the  data  were  preprocessed  and  the  approach  used  during  the  binary  and  multiclass  problems  is  presented.  the  processing  and  analysis  of  the  environmental  data  gathered  during  the  research  are  depicted  in
__label__environmentmonitoring ad.  in  the  charts,  the  blue  and  red  lines  represent  a  day  without  and  with  occupants  in  the  area  under  study,  respectively.  particularly,  in  b,  the  red  line  depicts  a  day  with  precisely  one  occupant  in  the  room  and  the  yellow  line  a  day  with  more  than  one  occupant.  processing  and  analysis  of  the  environmental  data  gathered.  in  a,  the  graph  is  in  celsius  degrees  by  hours.  for  this  analysis,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  the  data  corresponds  to  the  subtraction  of  the  indoor  and  outdoor  temperature  as  it  was  described  in  .  for  the  data  collected,  it
__label__environmentmonitoring is  possible  to  conclude  that  the  temperatures  difference  is  higher  with  occupants  than  without  occupants.  the  first  occupant  arrived  around  09:00  and  the  last  occupant  left  around  18:00.  there  are  a  couple  of  exceptions  around  10:00  and  around  12:00.  the  first  one  happens  because  of  the  incidence  of  the  sunlight  in  the  room,  which  on  this  period  of  test  occurs  at  this  hour,  increasing  the  indoor  temperature.  the  second  one  occurs  when  the  occupants  left  the  room  to  have  lunch.  in  b,  the  graph  is  in  ppm  per  hour.  it  is  possible  to  see  that  when  an  occupant  arrived  i.e.,
__label__environmentmonitoring around  09:00  the  co  levels  increased  approximately  500  ppm.  this  increase  was  more  noticeable  when  more  than  one  occupant  was  in  the  room,  increasing  to  around  2000  ppm.  in  days  without  occupants,  the  levels  were  between  400  and  450  ppm.  c  depicts  the  noise  data  processed.  it  is  possible  to  see  that  the  differences  are  not  significant  considering  that  the  values  are  almost  the  same  with  or  without  people.  the  light  intensity  data  is  depicted  in  d.  it  is  possible  to  see  that  when  an  occupant  arrived,  close  to  10:00,  the  lux  increased  to  around  110  and  when  he  left,
__label__environmentmonitoring close  to  18:00,  the  lux  decreased  to  zero.  around  10:00,  it  is  possible  to  notice  an  increase  in  the  light  intensity  as  a  result  of  the  incidence  of  the  sunlight  in  the  room.  this  behavior  is  consistent  with  the  results  and  the  observations  performed  during  the  analysis  of  the  temperature  in  the  room.  after  preprocessing  the  data,  each  classifier  was  tested.  the  results  obtained  are  presented  in  the  next  two  subsections.  the  binary  problem  aims  to  determine  whether  an  occupant  was  in  the  room  or  not  .  presents  the  results  by  applying  the  classifiers  with  the  dataset  without  changing  the
__label__environmentmonitoring parameters.  analysing  the  results,  the  classifiers  with  best  fscores  were  lr  followed  by  svm.  the  ann  classifier  had  the  lowest  fscore  in  almost  all  the  cases.  in  some  cases,  the  result  was  0,  i.e.,  the  classifier  could  not  predict  any  positive  outcome.  fscore  results  of  applying  ml  algorithms  to  the  data  collected  for  the  binary  problem  with  default  parameters.  regarding  the  noise  as  an  element  to  estimate  occupancy,  the  fscore  results  show  that  for  the  area  under  study  this  feature  is  not  a  good  indicator;  considering  that  the  room  is  a  workplace,  people  are  usually  concentrated  and  spend  most  of

__label__environmentmonitoring perform  as  expected.  one  possible  approach  to  enhance  the  results  obtained  would  be  to  calculate  the  derivative  and  then  check  whether  it  has  a  certain  slope  to  determine  if  an  occupant  arrived  or  left  the  room;  nevertheless,  this  method  requires  more  data,  as  well  as  more  analysis.  the  temperature  data  suffer  from  the  same  problem  than  the  co  data.  it  is  difficult  to  have  a  fixed  number  of  occupants  in  the  room.  thus,  it  was  important  to  have  a  dataset  with  more  data  for  calculating  the  time  taken  for  the  temperature  to  stabilise  to  improve  the  results.  however,  even  without

__label__environmentmonitoring data  analysed  has  to  suffer  changes  before  applying  a  ml  technique.  the  noise  had  a  low  fscore,  and  the  light  indicated  only  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants.  for  these  reasons,  only  the  temperature  was  analysed  in  a  multiclass  problem.  fscore  results  of  parameters  that  perform  the  highest  score  for  lr,  svm,  and  ann  for  the  binary  problem.  the  fscores  reached  by  the  classifiers,  particularly  in  the  case  of  temp  and  light,  show  that  it  is  possible  to  obtain  high  accuracy  regarding  indoor  occupancy  using  the  lr,  svm,  and  ann  classifiers,  which  is  aligned  with  some  of  the  results  reported
__label__environmentmonitoring in  the  state  of  the  art.  specifically,  in  the  research  work  of  candanedo  et  al.  ,  a  research  framed  within  the  same  topic  although  using  a  different  dataset,  the  authors  obtained  an  accuracy  of  85.33  for  temp  and  97.66  for  light  using  a  linear  discriminant  analysis  lda  model.  these  results  are  comparable  with  the  values  obtained  by  lr  and  svm  in  this  research  considering  the  classifiers  linearity.  in  the  case  of  temp,  lr  and  svm  showed  better  accuracy  i.e.,  around  4.  on  the  other  hand,  for  light,  lda  performed  better  than  lr  and  svm  by  around  2.  instead  of  an
__label__environmentmonitoring ann  approach,  candanedo  et  al.  decided  to  determine  the  performance  of  classification  and  regression  trees  cart  learning  algorithms  for  this  specific  problem.  the  accuracy  results  obtained  using  cart  were  86.51  and  99.31  for  temp  and  light,  respectively.  thus,  for  temp,  the  ann  approach  had  a  better  accuracy  89.72  i.e.,  around  3,  and,  in  the  case  of  light,  the  cart  model  beat  the  ann  classifier  by  around  4  i.e.,  99.31  against  95.32.  the  multiclass  problem  aims  to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  in  a  room.  during  this  work,  on  average,  there  were  five  occupants  in  the  room.  after  observing  the  behavior
__label__environmentmonitoring of  the  data  gathered  and  the  binary  problem  results,  it  is  possible  to  conclude  that  temperature  is  the  more  interesting  feature  to  be  tested  in  the  multiclass  approach.  even  though  it  was  possible  to  obtain  fscores  beyond  95  for  all  the  classifiers  for  the  data  corresponding  to  light,  its  binary  nature  makes  impossible  to  use  it  to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  in  the  area  under  study,  thus  it  was  discarded.  summarises  both  the  parameters  and  the  fscores  obtained  using  the  default  values  for  said  parameters,  and  after  tweaking  them.  concerning  the  analysis  of  the  temperature  data  using  the  default
__label__environmentmonitoring parameters  for  each  classifier,  the  following  fscores  results  were  obtained:  24.43  for  lr,  24.90  for  svm,  and  25.15  for  ann.  these  results  are  far  away  from  what  we  had  expected,  thus  an  additional  tweaking  of  the  parameter  was  applied  in  order  to  improve  the  fscores.  in  the  best  scenario,  the  following  fscores  results  were  obtained:  29.43  more  5  for  lr;  29.72  more  4.82  for  svm;  and  28.70  more  3.55  in  the  case  of  ann.  fscore  results  of  parameters  for  lr,  svm,  and  ann  for  the  multiclass  problem.  the  results  obtained  for  the  multiclass  problem  show  that  it  was  not  possible
__label__environmentmonitoring to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  using  just  the  temperature  data.  when  the  default  parameters  were  used,  all  the  classifiers  reported  almost  the  same  fscores,  i.e.,  around  24.5.  after  changing  the  parameters,  the  svm  classifier  produced  the  best  results  for  this  dataset,  around  29.72.  it  was  also  assumed  that  the  human  body  surface  had  a  uniform  temperature  and  a  consistent  heat  production,  but  this  is  not  necessarily  true.  the  human  body  has  a  distinct  physical  shape  and  also  has  multiple  thermophysiological  properties.  thus,  it  is  difficult  to  include  those  factors  in  a  numerical  constant  in  an  indoor  space.  a  valid
__label__environmentmonitoring estimation  of  the  number  of  occupants  in  indoor  environments  using  nonintrusive  environmental  sensors  requires  a  deep  study  of  the  correlation  of  the  data  gathered.  ml  techniques  have  proven  to  be  useful  to  better  understand  the  interaction  and  behavior  between  the  sensors,  according  to  the  changes  induced  by  the  occupants  in  indoor  environments.  for  the  multiclass  problem,  the  correlation  between  light,  temperature,  and  co  looks  promising.  in  a  first  step,  the  analysis  of  the  light  could  determine  accurately  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants,  and,  as  a  second  step,  a  study  of  the  correlation  between  temperature  and  co  could  enhance  the
__label__environmentmonitoring estimation  concerning  the  number  of  occupants  in  a  specific  area.  thus,  these  open  issues  lead  to  the  possibility  to  perform  future  research  in  this  field.  nowadays,  companies  and  researchers  are  working  on  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  of  citizens,  using  the  iot  paradigm  to  reach  the  idea  of  building  smart  environments.  in  this  context,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  have  mechanisms  to  predict  or  estimate  the  occupancy  of  indoor  environments  to  make  smart  decisions  about  how  to  selfadapt  to  the  environmental  conditions.  in  this  research,  a  solution  for  occupancy  detection  with  nonintrusive  devices  using  sensors  such  as  temperature,  noise,  co
__label__environmentmonitoring ,  and  light  intensity  was  proposed  and  tested.  a  functional  system,  made  up  of  a  device  to  gather  and  process  environmental  data,  and  to  analyse  the  data  patterns  over  the  collected  data  regarding  people  occupancy  in  indoor  environments  using  ml  methods,  was  tested.  the  analysis  performed  allows  asserting  that  with  features  such  as  noise  data  in  working  environments  the  performance  of  the  recognition  system  might  be  degraded.  however,  with  features  such  as  temperature,  co  ,  and  light  data,  it  will  be  possible  to  estimate  the  detection  of  occupants  with  an  acceptable  level  of  accuracy.  thus,  the  work  done  in  this
__label__environmentmonitoring research  could  feed  thirdparty  applications  focused  on  indoor  occupancy  detection  to  generate  smart  decisions  considering  the  occupants  needs.  for  future  works,  it  is  necessary  to  study  the  full  correlation  of  the  environmental  data  used  in  this  research.  a  starting  point  could  be  the  analysis  of  features  and  their  impact  on  the  system.  the  co  data  have  to  endure  some  processing  to  find  the  most  meaningful  way  to  use  this  type  of  data,  since  it  was  found  that  they  represent  one  of  the  best  features  to  detect  the  number  of  occupants.  david  perez  abreu  wishes  to  acknowledge  the  portuguese  funding  institution

__label__environmentmonitoring the  ncbi  web  site  requires  javascript  to  function.  smart  environments  try  to  adapt  their  conditions  focusing  on  the  detection,  localisation,  and  identification  of  people  to  improve  their  comfort.  it  is  common  to  use  different  sensors,  actuators,  and  analytic  techniques  in  this  kind  of  environments  to  process  data  from  the  surroundings  and  actuate  accordingly.  in  this  research,  a  solution  to  improve  the  users  experience  in  smart  environments  based  on  information  obtained  from  indoor  areas,  following  a  nonintrusive  approach,  is  proposed.  we  used  machine  learning  techniques  to  determine  occupants  and  estimate  the  number  of  persons  in  a  specific  indoor  space.  the  solution
__label__environmentmonitoring proposed  was  tested  in  a  real  scenario  using  a  prototype  system,  integrated  by  nodes  and  sensors,  specifically  designed  and  developed  to  gather  the  environmental  data  of  interest.  the  results  obtained  demonstrate  that  with  the  developed  system  it  is  possible  to  obtain,  process,  and  store  environmental  information.  additionally,  the  analysis  performed  over  the  gathered  data  using  machine  learning  and  pattern  recognition  mechanisms  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  determine  the  occupancy  of  indoor  environments.  the  internet  of  things  iot  paradigm  enables  the  interaction  between  physical  objects  via  application  services  to  add  characteristics  such  as  network  connectivity,  sensing,  and  actuation  allowing  to
__label__environmentmonitoring move  forward  to  the  smart  objects  approach.  thus,  smart  objects  can  communicate  with  each  other,  share  information,  and  coordinate  their  actions  in  order  to  take  smart  and  cognitive  decisions  according  to  the  environment  where  they  are  deployed  .  combining  the  iot  paradigm  and  the  smart  objects  approach,  the  concept  of  smart  city  arose.  a  smart  city  uses  a  variety  of  sensors  and  smart  objects  embedded  on  traditional  things  and  locations  e.g.,  buildings,  parks,  and  sidewalks  to  improve  the  citizens  quality  of  life.  one  of  the  smart  cities  sectors  is  smart  environments,  and  its  definition  is  given  by  cook  et  al.
__label__environmentmonitoring a  smart  environment  can  acquire  and  apply  knowledge  about  the  surroundings  and  its  inhabitants  to  improve  their  experience  in  that  ambiance  .  smart  environments  have  become  popular  in  recent  years  targeting  the  automation  of  everyday  tasks  in  order  to  improve  the  quality  of  life.  a  typical  example  of  this  kind  of  systems  is  the  management  of  energy  consumption  and  heat  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  hvac  ,  in  smart  buildings.  for  the  previous  particular  use  case,  it  is  essential  to  know  the  occupancy  estimation  of  specific  areas  in  order  to  trigger  the  proper  actions  to  minimise  consumption  during  periods  of  vacancy,
__label__environmentmonitoring optimise  ventilation  dynamically  for  occupant  comfort,  or  forecast  of  longterm  behaviors.  to  empower  the  smart  environment  approach,  the  use  of  learning  mechanisms  plays  a  key  role  to  analyse  patterns,  predict  situations,  and  take  decisions/actions.  thus,  new  terms  such  as  ambient  intelligence  ami  arise  in  this  context.  ami  brings  intelligence  to  our  everyday  environments,  making  them  sensitive  to  us.  amis  primary  goal  is  to  introduce  automation  into  the  environment  to  generate  knowledge  about  the  users  and  their  surroundings,  accumulating  data  and  taking  smart  and  cognitive  decisions  .  making  these  environments  smarter,  we  can  make  the  life  of  their  occupants  simpler  and
__label__environmentmonitoring more  automated.  a  specific  research  topic  framed  in  the  context  of  a  smart  environment  is  focused  on  looking  at  people,  detecting,  tracking  and  identifying  them,  as  a  way  to  offer  highquality,  intelligent  services,  while  considering  human  factors  such  as  life  patterns,  health,  and  mood  of  a  person  .  one  example  is  to  analyse  patterns  of  an  elderly  person  and  generate  an  alert  when  something  abnormal  happens.  for  this,  knowing  the  places  occupancy  is  a  priority.  many  techniques  are  developed  to  detect  the  presence  of  people,  the  most  common  are  cameras  and  wearable  devices.  however,  these  devices  suffer  from  privacy  or
__label__environmentmonitoring intrusiveness  issues.  research  challenges  arise  with  the  design  of  occupancy  detection  techniques.  one  of  these  challenges  is  related  to  how  to  preserve  occupants  privacy.  a  smart  environment  system  should  be  designed  to  avoid  identifying  occupants  or  their  activities.  thus,  there  is  the  need  for  nonintrusive  techniques  to  detect  occupancy  or  improve  the  mechanisms  already  available.  environmental  data  are  an  excellent  source  of  information  for  occupancy  detection  since  the  presence  of  living  beings  affects  the  surroundings  through  heat  or  carbon  dioxide  co  emission  without  jeopardising  the  privacy  of  the  occupants  in  that  particular  location.  nevertheless,  only  with  data,  it  is  almost
__label__environmentmonitoring impossible  to  gauge  something.  machine  learning  ml  techniques  look  at  the  data  and  try  to  find  patterns;  with  these  patterns,  it  is  possible  to  affirm  the  occupancy  with  a  certain  percentage  of  certainty.  although  some  contributions  have  been  performed  in  this  direction,  there  is  still  room  for  improvement,  and  this  research  proposal  is  focused  on  that.  the  main  purpose  of  this  research  is  the  design  and  development  of  an  affordable  and  nonintrusive  solution  to  improve  occupants  experience  in  smart  environments  with  ml  support.  the  proposed  solution  monitors  temperature,  light  intensity,  noise,  and  co  to  estimate  the  presence  of  occupants  through
__label__environmentmonitoring these  environmental  features  that  can  be  integrated  with  other  existent  approaches.  first,  the  data  are  collected  and  analysed,  before  applying  ml  techniques  to  infer  the  occupancy  of  the  area  under  monitoring.  in  the  first  stage,  our  solution  detects  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants.  in  the  second  stage,  the  number  of  occupants  inside  the  area  of  interest  is  estimated.  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  discusses  the  related  work.  presents  the  solution  developed  to  detect  occupants,  its  architecture,  and  the  key  features  that  were  considered,  the  gathering  system  and  the  ml  concerns.  shows  the  experimental  implementation.  analyses  and  discusses  the
__label__environmentmonitoring results  obtained.  finally,  conclusions  are  presented  in  as  well  as  suggestions  for  future  works.  occupancy  detection  systems  could  be  classified  according  to  the  need  to  use  a  terminal  or  not  ,  .  in  the  case  of  the  methods  that  require  a  terminal,  it  is  necessary  to  attach  a  device  to  the  occupants  to  keep  track  of  them  e.g.,  a  smartphone.  in  the  nonterminal  methods,  the  detection  is  based  on  a  passive  approach  that  is  focused  on  monitoring  areas  or  spaces  instead  of  the  identification  of  devices  e.g.,  cameras  monitoring  a  room.  depicts  a  simple  classification  of  the  occupancy  detection  methods
__label__environmentmonitoring following  the  terminal  and  nonterminal  approaches,  and  their  more  specific  characterisations,  which  are  used  to  organise  the  discussion  of  this  section.  a  simple  classification  of  occupancy/location  detection  methods.  in  the  branch  of  terminals,  the  methods  for  occupancy  and  counting  lay  on  devices  that  have  embedded  wireless  transmitters  which  support  different  communication  technologies,  such  as,  radiofrequency  identification  rfid,  wifi  and  bluetooth,  or  global  positioning  system  gps  in  the  case  of  wearable  devices.  on  the  other  hand,  the  branch  of  nonterminals  relies  on  monitoring  specific  surroundings  by  using  cameras,  smart  meters  for  energy  consumption,  or  environmental  sensors  e.g.,  co  and  temperature.  a
__label__environmentmonitoring discussion  of  some  relevant  works  on  occupancy  detection  is  presented  below.  hahnel  et  al.  proposed  a  probabilistic  measurement  model  for  rfid  readers  that  allows  accurately  tracking  rfid  tags  in  the  environment;  specifically,  the  authors  studied  the  problem  of  localising  the  rfid  tags  using  a  mobile  platform  based  in  robots  equipped  with  rfid  antennas.  li  and  becerikgerber  performed  a  survey  of  rfidbased  solutions  and  the  algorithms  used  for  occupancy  and  location  at  indoor  environments.  after  discussing  more  than  twenty  projects,  authors  identify  the  drawbacks  of  each  solution  to  move  forward  to  the  identification  of  the  most  relevant  research  challenges  regarding  outdoor/indoor
__label__environmentmonitoring location  sensing  solutions.  in  a  followup  research,  li  et  al.  proposed  an  energysaving  strategy  for  smart  buildings  based  on  rfid  occupancy  detection  to  support  demanddriven  hvac  operation  by  detecting  and  tracking  occupants  around  areas  of  interest  inside  the  buildings.  the  use  of  rfid  technologies  for  occupancy  detection  is  an  affordable  option  considering  the  price  of  receptors  and  tags;  nonetheless,  this  approach  could  be  affected  by  electric  and  magnetic  conditions  of  the  environment  leading  to  inaccurate  occupancy  detection.  a  more  constraining  issue  is  the  fact  that  occupants  have  to  carry  a  special  tag  to  be  monitored,  making  the  process  invasive  and
__label__environmentmonitoring susceptible  to  additional  errors  in  case  the  occupants  forget  their  specific  devices  somewhere.  some  occupation  detection  methods  take  advantage  of  the  communication  technologies  embedded  in  devices  commonly  used  by  the  occupants  of  the  area  of  interest,  such  as  smartphones,  smartwatches,  and  fitness  trackers.  huh  and  seo  came  up  with  a  system  that  estimates  the  indoor  position  of  a  user  taking  advantage  of  some  specific  characteristics  of  the  bluetooth  protocol.  specifically,  the  system  uses  beacon  frames  to  extract  information  about  the  received  signal  strength  indication  rssi  and  trilateration  that  is  processed  to  infer  indoor  positioning.  filippoupolitis  et  al.  evaluated  how  accurate
__label__environmentmonitoring occupancy  estimation  in  indoor  environments  using  bluetooth  low  energy  ble  could  be  in  a  prototype  system  composed  of  ble  beacons,  a  mobile  application,  and  a  server.  after  performing  the  analysis  of  the  data  collected  using  three  ml  approaches  i.e.,  knearest  neighbors,  logistic  regression,  and  support  vector  machine,  the  authors  concluded  that  the  combination  of  ble  and  ml  leads  to  a  good  occupancy  estimation.  depatla  et  al.  proposed  a  framework  for  counting  the  total  number  of  people  walking  in  an  area  based  on  the  wifi  rssi  measurements  between  a  pair  of  transmitter/receiver  antennas.  the  authors  developed  a  mathematical  model  to  determine
__label__environmentmonitoring the  probability  distribution  of  the  received  signal  amplitude  as  a  function  of  the  total  number  of  occupants  based  on  kullbackleiber  divergence  estimation.  the  results  obtained  concluded  the  authors  approach  could  estimate  the  total  number  of  people  in  indoor  and  outdoor  areas  with  good  accuracy.  balaji  et  al.  designed  a  system,  sentinel,  that  leverages  in  the  wifi  infrastructure  deployed  in  the  area  of  interest  along  with  smartphone  carried  by  occupants  to  estimate  occupancy  and  enhance  the  performance  of  the  hvac  system  via  actuation.  the  sentinel  system  proposed  by  the  authors  shows  an  accuracy  of  86,  with  6.2  false  negative  error  regarding
__label__environmentmonitoring the  occupancy  in  indoor  environments.  additionally,  the  tests  performed  depict  that  using  actuation  over  the  hvac  system  it  was  possible  to  save  around  17.8  energy.  wearable  electronics,  such  as  smartwatches  and  fitness  trackers  are  becoming  more  ubiquitous  and  carrying  more  sensors  and  communication  interfaces.  jin  et  al.  took  advantage  of  the  previous  statement  to  investigate  the  causal  influence  of  user  activity  on  various  environmental  parameters  monitored  by  occupantcarried  multipurpose  sensors.  their  results  showed  that  the  fusion  of  the  data  collected  from  the  sensors  available  in  the  wearable  devices  e.g.,  light  level,  accelerometer,  heart  rate,  bluetooth,  and  gps  achieves  a  good
__label__environmentmonitoring classification  regarding  occupancy/location  reaching  in  some  cases  values  around  99  of  accuracy.  the  quality  of  data  obtained  using  the  method  that  involved  wearable  devices,  wifi  and  bluetooth  allows  a  more  accurate  occupancy/location  estimation;  however,  these  approaches  have  privacy  concerns  regarding  how  to  use  the  data  gathered.  for  example,  the  use  of  bluetooth  allows  having  access  to  specific  and  unique  information  of  the  devices,  such  as  the  mac  address;  or  in  the  case  of  a  fitness  tracker  the  heart  rate  histogram  could  reveal  some  particular  condition  or  disease.  this  information  could  be  crossed  with  other  data  to  obtain  detailed  information  about
__label__environmentmonitoring the  owner  of  the  device.  in  the  nonterminal  branch  for  occupancy/location,  the  methods  that  use  cameras  are  wellknown.  fleuret  et  al.  combined  a  generative  model  with  dynamic  programming  to  track  occlusions  and  lighting  changes  in  frame  images  in  order  to  derive  the  trajectories  of  each  of  them.  with  the  proposed  model,  authors  were  able  to  track  multiple  persons  and  ranked  their  trajectories  inside  the  area  under  study.  alahi  et  al.  addressed  the  problem  of  localising  people  in  crowds  using  a  network  of  heterogeneous  cameras  by  formulating  a  problem  focused  on  calculating  the  occupancy  vector  per  each  captured  frame;  this  is
__label__environmentmonitoring the  discretised  occupancy  of  people  on  the  ground  from  the  foreground  silhouettes.  the  occupancy  approach  proposed  is  complemented  by  a  graphdriven  tracking  procedure  suited  to  deal  with  the  temporal  dynamics  of  people  occupancy  vectors.  the  main  outcome  of  this  work  is  a  welldefined  mathematical  formulation  to  locate  people  via  cameras  that  record  frames  with  very  noisy  features.  in  the  same  way  as  with  the  wearable  solutions  discussed  above,  the  use  of  cameras  for  occupancy/location  brings  a  set  of  privacy  issues  regarding  the  identity  of  occupants  and  objects  that  could  represent  a  problem  in  the  final  solution.  a  different  solution  based
__label__environmentmonitoring on  smart  meters  is  presented  by  chen  et  al.  .  they  tried  to  predict  the  occupancy  analysing  electrical  usage.  they  observed  that  the  homes  pattern  of  electricity  usage  changes  when  there  are  occupants.  the  study  was  carried  out  in  two  homes  and  later  on  correlated  with  statistical  data  e.g.,  powers  mean  and  variance.  some  challenges  on  nonintrusive  occupancy  monitoring  are  also  discussed.  another  solution  by  lee  et  al.  used  an  array  of  pyroelectric  infrared  sensors  pir  to  detect  residents  location  in  a  smart  home.  the  authors  also  proposed  an  algorithm  to  analyse  the  information  collected  from  the  pir  sensors.  the
__label__environmentmonitoring evaluation  was  carried  out  using  an  experimental  testbed.  jin  et  al.  tested  several  binary  techniques  using  data  from  residential  and  commercial  buildings  based  on  information  regarding  power  usage  that  requires  minimal  system  calibration  and  setup,  while  also  ensuring  the  privacy  of  the  occupants.  the  accuracy  of  these  works  to  determine  the  number  of  occupants  is  low  and  could  be  considered  just  an  estimation  since  the  power  consumption  is  aggregated,  consequently,  the  exact  number  of  people  occupying  the  area  of  interest  could  not  be  accurate.  the  results  of  dong  et  al.  indicate  that  co  and  acoustic  parameters  have  the  most  significant
__label__environmentmonitoring correlation  with  the  number  of  occupants  in  a  space.  several  studies  correlate  the  co  concentrations  with  the  presence  of  occupants  such  as  in  the  research  of  gruber  et  al.  .  ryu  et  al.  used  indoor  and  outdoor  co  concentrations  and  electricity  consumptions  of  lighting  systems  in  a  controlled  testbed.  although  the  co  levels  could  be  used  to  determine  occupancy,  gathering  this  kind  of  data  with  good  levels  of  accuracy  is  not  an  easy  task  considering  that  aspects  such  as  room  ventilation,  room  flowrate,  and  presence  of  plants  in  the  room  could  drastically  influence  the  concentration  and  dissipation  of  the  aforementioned
__label__environmentmonitoring gas.  thus,  it  is  not  feasible  to  only  use  co  as  a  metric  for  occupancy  estimation.  candanedo  et  al.  and  amayri  estimated  occupancy  using  a  combination  of  heterogeneous  sensors.  the  first  research  uses  data  from  light,  temperature,  humidity  and  co  sensors;  and  the  second  one  uses  data  from  luminance,  temperature,  humidity,  motion  detection,  power  consumption,  and  co  ,  as  well  as  data  collected  from  a  microphone  or  door/window  burglary  sensors.  these  works  follow  the  same  ground  truth  strategy  focused  on  cameras  to  corroborate  the  presence  of  occupants,  which  introduce  several  privacy  constraints.  additionally,  both  works  utilise  ml  techniques  to  evaluate
__label__environmentmonitoring the  results  of  the  proposed  solutions,  particularly,  decision  tree  learning  algorithms.  considering  the  number  of  sensors  and  devices  used  in  these  studies  were  significantly  high,  our  proposal  is  focused  on  answering  the  question  whether  it  is  possible  to  obtain  similar  or  better  results  regarding  occupancy  detection  using  fewer  resources.  even  more,  our  proposal  uses  a  nonintrusive  ground  truth  strategy  to  avoid  jeopardising  the  privacy  and  security  of  the  occupants  in  the  area  of  interest.  this  research  uses  as  inspiration  some  of  the  ideas  proposed  in  the  works  discussed,  in  particular,  the  gathering  of  data  from  different  sources  to  move  forward
__label__environmentmonitoring to  a  complete  analysis  of  the  data  collected  using  a  ml  approach.  our  goal  is  to  detect  occupancy  in  indoor  environments  by  preprocessing  the  datasets  collected  before  applying  ml  to  a  binary  and  multiclass  problem.  additionally,  we  design  our  solution  focused  on  two  main  requirements:  the  first  one  is  to  try  to  take  advantage  of  cheap/affordable  devices  commonly  deployed  in  smart  environment,  and  the  second  one  is  to  guarantee  that  the  privacy  of  the  occupants  in  the  area  under  study  would  not  be  compromised.  thus,  after  the  discussion  of  the  works  in  this  research  area,  our  proposal  uses  environmental  features
__label__environmentmonitoring via  the  combination  of  data  gathered  from  different  sensors.  this  solution  is  presented  in  the  following  section.  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  occupancy  detection  could  be  used  to  trigger  some  actuation  mechanisms  in  smart  environments  in  order  to  improve  resource  usage  and  user  experience,  among  other  factors.  an  important  issue  that  must  be  considered  is  the  preservation  of  privacy  of  the  data  collected  and  analysed.  additionally,  it  would  be  desirable  to  take  advantage  of  the  infrastructure  available  in  the  surroundings  to  avoid  incurring  in  extra  expenses,  while  allowing  the  scalability  of  the  solution.  considering  these  factors,  this  research  is
__label__environmentmonitoring focused  on  a  nonintrusive  and  inexpensive  solution  for  occupancy  estimation  that  ensures  occupants  privacy  while  taking  advantage  of  the  technological  infrastructure  already  available  in  common  smart  environments  including  smart  buildings  and  smart  homes.  from  the  analysis  performed  on  ,  and  to  comply  with  the  previously  established  requirements,  our  occupancy  detection  solution  is  focused  on  environmental  data.  a  scene  analysis  approach  is  used  in  this  research  to  extract  the  features  of  interest  for  indoor  scenarios  to  proceed  and  then  to  estimate  the  occupancy  in  the  area  using  the  gathered  data  .  the  scene  analysis  method  does  not  rely  on  any  theoretical
__label__environmentmonitoring model  or  specific  hardware;  however,  it  requires  a  preliminary  phase  for  capturing  features  which  are  influenced  by  changes  in  the  area  of  interest  .  in  this  section,  we  explain  the  criteria  applied  to  select  the  features  used  in  our  solution  before  moving  forward  to  the  description  of  the  design  of  the  fourlayers  architecture  adopted  for  the  gathering  and  processing  of  the  data.  the  section  concludes  with  the  discussion  of  the  ml  classifiers  that  were  selected  to  improve  the  performance  of  occupancy  detection  in  indoor  environments.  summarises  the  terms  used  in  the  remaining  of  the  manuscript.  notation  table.  c  a  human
__label__environmentmonitoring body  is  similar  to  a  machine,  as  to  perform  actions  it  needs  energy.  the  first  and  second  laws  of  thermodynamics  state  that  it  is  impossible  to  create  energy  out  of  nowhere  and  a  hot  body  transfers  its  energy  to  a  cold  one.  consequently,  the  human  body  is  subject  to  these  laws.  this  energy  is  interchanged  with  the  environment,  in  the  form  of  heat,  can  be  by  sensible  heat  conduction,  convection,  and  radiation  or  latent  heat  transfers  evaporation  and  condensation  .  a  healthy  adult  human  releases  approximately  between  100  watts  in  a  resting  state  and  1000  watts  in  an  effort  state,
__label__environmentmonitoring equivalent  to  the  heat  dissipated  by  a  few  laptops  .  thus,  the  heat  of  an  environment  is  influenced  by  the  number  of  persons  in  there.  similar  to  heat,  co  is  a  side  effect  of  the  metabolism.  it  is  an  essential  gas  for  the  existence  of  life,  but  at  very  high  concentrations  e.g.,  greater  than  5000  parts  per  million  ppm  it  can  pose  a  health  risk.  co  concentrations  commonly  found  in  buildings  are  not  a  direct  health  risk,  but  this  concentration  can  be  used  as  an  indicator  of  occupancy  .  in  fact,  occupants  are  the  principal  source  of  co  increasing  in
__label__environmentmonitoring indoor  environments  .  in  1879,  thomas  edison  invented  the  first  light  bulb  which  made  viable  to  extend  the  working  hours  of  the  human  beings  .  nowadays,  it  is  common  to  have  artificial  light  in  working  spaces.  this  fact  enables  the  possibility  of  drawing  a  relation  between  light  sources  and  occupancy  in  indoor  environments.  noise  is  another  feature  that  is  affected  by  the  number  of  human  beings  in  an  ambient  .  thus,  it  is  possible  to  expect  that  the  noise  of  a  specific  place  will  increase  with  the  number  of  people  there.  an  important  fact  that  should  be  considered  in  indoor
__label__environmentmonitoring environments  is  that  they  usually  have  background  noise  produced  by  household  appliances  or  other  static  sources  of  sound.  considering  the  discussion  and  facts  addressed  so  far  in  this  section,  this  research  uses  the  following  environmental  features  to  detect  and  estimate  the  occupancy  of  indoor  environments:  heat  via  the  measurement  of  the  temperature  in  the  area  of  interest,  co  ,  light  intensity,  and  noise.  specifically,  a  testbed  was  designed  to  acquire  the  data  and  extract  the  information  to  be  analysed  using  a  ml  approach.  in  the  next  subsection,  the  architecture  designed  and  used  to  process  the  data  gathered  from  the  features

__label__environmentmonitoring data  collected  and  analysed  are  stored  using  a  mysql  database  version  5.5.  the  tool  used  to  perform  the  analytics  of  the  data  was  matlab  version  v.9.2.r2017a.  application  layer  :  deals  with  the  utilisation  of  the  processed  data.  it  includes  services  and  applications.  this  last  layer  uses  the  previous  layers  to  acquire  raw  data  through  sensors,  storing  and  treating  it  to  apply  ml  techniques  to  perform  the  main  goal  of  this  research,  which  is  to  detect  people  in  indoor  environments  using  a  nonintrusive  approach.  data  processing  architecture.  the  flow  of  data  in  the  processing  architecture  begins  at  the  lower  level  with
__label__environmentmonitoring the  raw  data  acquisition  via  environmental  sensors.  specifically,  every  time  that  the  arduino  yun  receives  a  signal  from  the  rpi  every  10  s,  the  former  one  gets  ten  samples  with  a  delay  of  100  microseconds.  next,  an  average  is  computed  and  sent  to  the  rpi.  finally,  a  new  average  is  calculated  using  the  aggregated  data  of  six  values  and  it  is  stored  in  the  mysql  database.  with  this  average,  it  is  possible  to  decrease  the  fluctuations  in  the  data.  this  process  is  repeated  every  minute.  in  the  upper  layers  of  the  architecture,  the  analytic  functions  using  ml  are  run  over
__label__environmentmonitoring the  data  collected  and  stored  after  preprocessing  it.  thus,  the  outcome  of  the  application  layer  will  be  an  estimation  of  the  occupancy  of  the  indoor  area  under  study.  in  the  ml  context,  a  supervised  approach  is  used  to  process  the  data  so  the  system  could  learn  from  it.  we  use  three  classifiers:  logistic  regression  lr,  a  direct  probabilistic  interpretation;  support  vector  machine  svm,  a  hyperplane  with  the  maximal  margin  to  separate  the  data  with  similarities;  and  artificial  neural  network  ann,  a  classifier  inspired  by  how  the  human  brain  works.  for  the  ann  case,  the  hypothesis  function  is  obtained  by  processing
__label__environmentmonitoring the  input  features  via  a  set  of  activation  units.  these  classifiers  are  largely  used  in  classification  problems  ,  ,  .  the  purpose  of  using  these  three  classifiers  is  to  compare  and  select  the  best  classifier,  considering  the  specific  problem  and  the  features  involved.  some  parameters  can  improve  the  overall  performance  of  the  classifier.  these  parameters  have  fix/default  value  results  under  the  same  conditions.  thus,  it  is  necessary  to  tweak  the  classifiers  parameters  according  the  problem  under  study  to  improve  the  results  obtained  during  the  analysis  of  the  data.  for  lr,  the  regularisation  parameter  and  the  degree  of  the  polynomial  were
__label__environmentmonitoring used.  in  the  case  of  svm,  we  applied  the  penalty  cost  c  ,  and  the  standard  deviation  parameter  .  for  ann,  the  number  of  hidden  layers  units  ,  and  the  previous  and  parameters  were  utilised.  regarding  the  default  cases,  for  lr,  a  sigmoid  function  with  threshold  equal  to  ,  ,  and  was  used.  for  svm,  a  radialbasis  function  rbf  kernel  was  used  in  conjunction  with  these  values  and  .  for  ann,  three  layers  input  layer,  hidden  layer,  and  output  layer  were  used,  and  the  following  values  were  set:  ,  ,  and  .  these  values  represent  the  base  cases  for  each
__label__environmentmonitoring classifier  before  proceeding  with  a  grid  search  during  the  training  phase  in  order  to  tweak  them  to  improve  the  performance  of  each  classifier.  for  lr,  the  possible  values  of  were  and  for  the  range  was  13.  for  svm,  values  were  ,  and  c  could  assume  .  finally,  for  ann,  could  take  the  following  values  ,  the  range  of  values  of  was  13,  and  could  assume  13.  to  select  the  default  and  improved  values  for  the  classifiers,  we  used  the  recommendations  of  clarke  et  al.  and  perez  et  al.  .  in  this  research,  two  problems  were  studied,  a  binary  problem,  where
__label__environmentmonitoring the  positive  case  is  the  presence  of  occupants  and  the  negative  case  is  the  absence  of  occupants,  and  a  multiclass  problem,  where  the  objective  is  to  determine  the  exact  number  of  occupants.  the  research  started  with  the  selection  of  the  features  to  estimate  the  occupancy  in  indoor  environments,  to  move  forward  to  the  design  of  the  fourlayers  data  processing  architecture  corresponding  to:  1  the  sensors  to  gather  the  data  concerning  the  features  selected;  2  the  communication  protocols  used  between  sensors,  microcontrollers,  and  processors;  3  how  to  preprocess  and  store  the  data;  and  4  the  analysis  of  the  data  collected  using
__label__environmentmonitoring a  ml  approach  where  the  different  classifiers  were  tested  in  order  to  determine  the  best  one  by  tweaking  their  parameters.  the  setup  of  the  testbed  used  in  this  work,  as  well  as  how  the  ml  classifiers  were  evaluated  according  to  their  performance  is  detailed  in  the  next  section.  the  experiments  were  conducted  in  a  room  of  the  laboratory  of  communications  and  telematicscentre  for  informatics  and  systems  located  in  the  middle  of  the  department  of  informatics  engineering  at  the  university  of  coimbra.  the  room  has  an  area  of  8.5  5.5  m  and  4.15  m  of  height.  this  room  has  a  small
__label__environmentmonitoring occupancy  change  the  maximum  number  of  occupants  is  five,  and  the  minimum  number  of  occupants  is  zero  and  very  low  ventilation.  the  only  ventilation  in  the  room  is  the  door  and  few  window  cracks.  the  heating,  ventilation,  and  air  conditioning  equipment  were  off  during  the  time  of  the  tests  to  prevent  any  influence  on  the  data  collected,  and  it  was  assumed  that  the  occupants  kept  the  doors  and  windows  closed  and  the  lights  on  during  the  period  they  were  in  there.  this  testbed  was  set  up  to  study  occupancy  detection  in  indoor  environments  using  nonintrusive  sensors  and  ml  techniques.  the
__label__environmentmonitoring primary  objective  of  the  experiments  is  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  regarding  occupancy  detection  in  two  branches,  the  simplest  one  focuses  on  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants;  and  the  more  advanced  one  on  the  estimation  of  the  number  of  occupants.  in  the  remainder  of  this  section,  we  discuss  about  the  placement  of  the  nodes  to  collect  the  environmental  data  and  analysis  performed  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  and  precision  of  the  classifier  utilised.  the  datasets  used  in  this  research,  as  well  as  the  source  code  used  in  the  nodes  e.g.,  arduinos  and  rpis  and  the  analysis  of  the  data  using  ml
__label__environmentmonitoring methods,  are  available  via  a  github  repository  .  three  gathering  and  processing  nodes  i.e.,  3  rpis  and  3  arduinos  were  placed  in  the  room  see  in  strategic  positions  to  collect  data.  shows  the  physical  location  of  the  nodes  in  the  area  under  study.  node  1  has  a  temperature  in  and  out  and  sound  sensors;  node  2  has  temperature,  co  and  sound  sensors;  and  node  3  has  the  most  significant  variety  of  sensors  including  temperature,  co  ,  sound,  and  light  intensity.  besides  gathering  environmental  data,  node  1  is  responsible  for  controlling  the  number  of  occupants  in  the  room  i.e.,  the  ground

__label__environmentmonitoring on  it  was  one  of  the  lamps.  regarding  the  temperature,  a  sensor  was  placed  in  the  hallway  and  other  sensors  inside  the  room.  the  difference  between  the  temperatures  gathered  at  these  two  different  places  was  analysed  to  estimate  the  occupancy  in  the  room.  a  ground  of  truth  approach  was  adopted  in  this  research  to  validate  the  data  gathered.  concretely,  in  this  work,  a  simple  mechanism  with  two  buttons  blue  to  enter  and  red  to  leave  was  developed  to  create  the  ground  truth  and  register  when  a  person  enters  or  leaves  the  room.  every  time  that  an  occupant  presses  one  of
__label__environmentmonitoring these  buttons,  the  counter  is  increased  or  decreased,  respectively.  to  visualise  if  the  number  of  occupants  is  correct,  three  led  were  introduced  as  a  binary  counter  occupants  in  the  room.  the  leftmost  led  is  the  most  significant  and  the  rightmost  led  is  the  least  significant.  the  number  of  total  occupants  by  minute  is  the  average  of  samples  acquired  every  10  s.  to  analyse  the  performance  of  the  classifiers,  several  criteria  were  used.  accuracy  measures  the  percentage  of  entries  that  were  correctly  classified  see  equation  ,  and  the  miss  rate  measures  the  percentage  of  entries  that  were  incorrectly  classified  see  equation
__label__environmentmonitoring .  true  positive  tp  and  true  negative  tn  represent  the  correct  classification/prediction  if  the  entry  belongs  to  the  positive  class  or  negative  class,  respectively.  false  negative  fn  and  false  positive  fp  represent  the  incorrect  classification/prediction  if  the  entry  does  not  belong  to  the  negative  and  positive  classes,  respectively  .  where  n  is  the  total  size  of  the  training  dataset.  to  evaluate  a  classifier,  it  is  necessary  to  verify  its  accuracy  when  it  has  to  process  new  data.  the  classifiers  can  have  a  high  accuracy  when  they  are  tested  with  the  training  dataset,  but  they  can  have  a  low  accuracy  with
__label__environmentmonitoring a  new  dataset.  thus,  it  is  recommended  to  split  the  data  into  a  training  dataset  and  a  testing  dataset  .  the  training  dataset  is  suitable  to  train  the  classifiers,  and  the  testing  dataset  is  appropriated  to  measure  their  performance  to  new  entries.  typically,  the  dataset  is  divided  into  three  portions:  training  to  train  the  classifiers,  crossvalidation  to  adjust  the  parameters,  and  testing  to  verify  the  performance  of  the  classifiers  ,  .  in  this  work,  the  dataset  used  was  split  following  the  same  approach,  particularly  for  the  cross  validation  the  kfold  method  with  was  used  .  in  certain  cases,  the  dataset
__label__environmentmonitoring can  have  skewed  classes,  i.e.,  one  class  has  a  small  set  of  data.  for  example,  assuming  that  the  training  dataset  contains  0  positive  and  100  negative  entries,  and  if  all  instances  are  predicted  correctly,  the  accuracy  will  be  100,  but  the  classifier  had  no  chance  of  learning  the  hidden  patterns.  with  the  previous  example,  it  can  be  said  that  the  accuracy  does  not  work  well  when  the  dataset  is  unbalanced,  i.e.,  it  has  more  data  in  one  class  than  in  the  other.  the  fscore  was  used  to  predict  the  performance  of  the  classifiers.  it  is  a  technique  that  measures  the
__label__environmentmonitoring discrimination  of  classes,  through  a  harmonic  mean  of  two  metrics,  recall  and  precision  see  equation  .  recall  measures  the  percentage  of  entries  that  belongs  to  the  positive  class  and  was  classified/predicted  correctly  see  equation  .  precision  measures  the  percentage  of  hits  over  the  entries  of  the  predicted  positive  class  that  really  belongs  to  positive  class  see  equation  .  to  have  a  high  fscore,  both  precision  and  recall  must  be  high.  equation  can  only  be  applied  to  binary  classification  problems,  but  it  can  be  extrapolated  to  a  multiclass  classification  problem.  the  macroaverage  method  takes  the  average  of  precision  and  recall  of

__label__environmentmonitoring the  data  is  depicted  in  .  performance  of  the  outlier  and  lpf  filters  over  the  temperature  i.e.,  difference  of  outdoor  and  indoor  temperatures  data  gathered.  an  lpf  is  a  circuit  that  offers  easy  passage  to  lowfrequency  signals  and  difficult  passage  to  highfrequency  signals.  equation  gives  the  discrete  implementation  of  the  first  order  lpf,  where  is  the  smoothing  factor,  y  is  the  filtered  output,  x  is  the  input,  and  n  is  the  sample  index.  calculating  the  next  value  through  this  smoothing  factor  and  the  previous  value,  it  was  possible  to  reduce  the  data  noise,  making  the  transitions  between  samples  slower  and
__label__environmentmonitoring smoother.  in  a  second  stage,  ten  consecutive  days  of  data  were  selected,  representing  a  total  of  14,400  samples  where  almost  25  represented  positive  cases,  and  75  represented  negative  cases  for  each  dataset  and  the  ml  mechanisms  were  applied.  the  dataset  was  divided  into  two  portions,  training  and  testing.  the  training  portion  was  then  subdivided  into  two  portions,  training  and  crossvalidation  portions,  respectively,  representing  70  of  the  original  dataset  and  the  remaining  30  corresponds  to  a  testing  portion.  within  the  first  portion  i.e.,  training  80  was  used  for  training  and  20  was  used  for  crossvalidation  according  to  the  kfold  with  a
__label__environmentmonitoring approach  to  prevent  overfitting  .  this  value  for  was  selected  given  the  unbalanced  nature  of  our  dataset,  where  the  average  occupancy  was  around  8  h  per  day  that  corresponds  to  office  hours;  thus,  having  periods  of  16  h  without  relevant  data  per  day.  using  this  value  i.e.,  ,  we  minimise  the  probability  of  having  kportions  without  any  relevant  data.  in  the  remaining  of  the  section,  a  discussion  about  how  the  data  were  preprocessed  and  the  approach  used  during  the  binary  and  multiclass  problems  is  presented.  the  processing  and  analysis  of  the  environmental  data  gathered  during  the  research  are  depicted  in
__label__environmentmonitoring ad.  in  the  charts,  the  blue  and  red  lines  represent  a  day  without  and  with  occupants  in  the  area  under  study,  respectively.  particularly,  in  b,  the  red  line  depicts  a  day  with  precisely  one  occupant  in  the  room  and  the  yellow  line  a  day  with  more  than  one  occupant.  processing  and  analysis  of  the  environmental  data  gathered.  in  a,  the  graph  is  in  celsius  degrees  by  hours.  for  this  analysis,  it  is  important  to  point  out  that  the  data  corresponds  to  the  subtraction  of  the  indoor  and  outdoor  temperature  as  it  was  described  in  .  for  the  data  collected,  it
__label__environmentmonitoring is  possible  to  conclude  that  the  temperatures  difference  is  higher  with  occupants  than  without  occupants.  the  first  occupant  arrived  around  09:00  and  the  last  occupant  left  around  18:00.  there  are  a  couple  of  exceptions  around  10:00  and  around  12:00.  the  first  one  happens  because  of  the  incidence  of  the  sunlight  in  the  room,  which  on  this  period  of  test  occurs  at  this  hour,  increasing  the  indoor  temperature.  the  second  one  occurs  when  the  occupants  left  the  room  to  have  lunch.  in  b,  the  graph  is  in  ppm  per  hour.  it  is  possible  to  see  that  when  an  occupant  arrived  i.e.,
__label__environmentmonitoring around  09:00  the  co  levels  increased  approximately  500  ppm.  this  increase  was  more  noticeable  when  more  than  one  occupant  was  in  the  room,  increasing  to  around  2000  ppm.  in  days  without  occupants,  the  levels  were  between  400  and  450  ppm.  c  depicts  the  noise  data  processed.  it  is  possible  to  see  that  the  differences  are  not  significant  considering  that  the  values  are  almost  the  same  with  or  without  people.  the  light  intensity  data  is  depicted  in  d.  it  is  possible  to  see  that  when  an  occupant  arrived,  close  to  10:00,  the  lux  increased  to  around  110  and  when  he  left,
__label__environmentmonitoring close  to  18:00,  the  lux  decreased  to  zero.  around  10:00,  it  is  possible  to  notice  an  increase  in  the  light  intensity  as  a  result  of  the  incidence  of  the  sunlight  in  the  room.  this  behavior  is  consistent  with  the  results  and  the  observations  performed  during  the  analysis  of  the  temperature  in  the  room.  after  preprocessing  the  data,  each  classifier  was  tested.  the  results  obtained  are  presented  in  the  next  two  subsections.  the  binary  problem  aims  to  determine  whether  an  occupant  was  in  the  room  or  not  .  presents  the  results  by  applying  the  classifiers  with  the  dataset  without  changing  the
__label__environmentmonitoring parameters.  analysing  the  results,  the  classifiers  with  best  fscores  were  lr  followed  by  svm.  the  ann  classifier  had  the  lowest  fscore  in  almost  all  the  cases.  in  some  cases,  the  result  was  0,  i.e.,  the  classifier  could  not  predict  any  positive  outcome.  fscore  results  of  applying  ml  algorithms  to  the  data  collected  for  the  binary  problem  with  default  parameters.  regarding  the  noise  as  an  element  to  estimate  occupancy,  the  fscore  results  show  that  for  the  area  under  study  this  feature  is  not  a  good  indicator;  considering  that  the  room  is  a  workplace,  people  are  usually  concentrated  and  spend  most  of
__label__environmentmonitoring the  time  in  silence.  the  results  of  the  fscore  related  to  the  light  intensity  were  satisfactory  with  the  limitation  that  this  approach  could  not  be  used  to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  in  the  room,  just  their  presence.  as  more  occupants  in  the  room  usually  results  in  higher  co  concentrations,  these  data  can  detect  the  number  of  occupants,  as  can  be  seen  in  b.  however,  because  the  room  does  not  have  a  good  air  flow  rate,  this  concentration  reduces  slowly  and  can  take  hours  to  stabilise.  consequently,  this  approach  to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  inside  the  laboratory  did  not
__label__environmentmonitoring perform  as  expected.  one  possible  approach  to  enhance  the  results  obtained  would  be  to  calculate  the  derivative  and  then  check  whether  it  has  a  certain  slope  to  determine  if  an  occupant  arrived  or  left  the  room;  nevertheless,  this  method  requires  more  data,  as  well  as  more  analysis.  the  temperature  data  suffer  from  the  same  problem  than  the  co  data.  it  is  difficult  to  have  a  fixed  number  of  occupants  in  the  room.  thus,  it  was  important  to  have  a  dataset  with  more  data  for  calculating  the  time  taken  for  the  temperature  to  stabilise  to  improve  the  results.  however,  even  without

__label__environmentmonitoring data  analysed  has  to  suffer  changes  before  applying  a  ml  technique.  the  noise  had  a  low  fscore,  and  the  light  indicated  only  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants.  for  these  reasons,  only  the  temperature  was  analysed  in  a  multiclass  problem.  fscore  results  of  parameters  that  perform  the  highest  score  for  lr,  svm,  and  ann  for  the  binary  problem.  the  fscores  reached  by  the  classifiers,  particularly  in  the  case  of  temp  and  light,  show  that  it  is  possible  to  obtain  high  accuracy  regarding  indoor  occupancy  using  the  lr,  svm,  and  ann  classifiers,  which  is  aligned  with  some  of  the  results  reported

__label__environmentmonitoring ann  approach,  candanedo  et  al.  decided  to  determine  the  performance  of  classification  and  regression  trees  cart  learning  algorithms  for  this  specific  problem.  the  accuracy  results  obtained  using  cart  were  86.51  and  99.31  for  temp  and  light,  respectively.  thus,  for  temp,  the  ann  approach  had  a  better  accuracy  89.72  i.e.,  around  3,  and,  in  the  case  of  light,  the  cart  model  beat  the  ann  classifier  by  around  4  i.e.,  99.31  against  95.32.  the  multiclass  problem  aims  to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  in  a  room.  during  this  work,  on  average,  there  were  five  occupants  in  the  room.  after  observing  the  behavior
__label__environmentmonitoring of  the  data  gathered  and  the  binary  problem  results,  it  is  possible  to  conclude  that  temperature  is  the  more  interesting  feature  to  be  tested  in  the  multiclass  approach.  even  though  it  was  possible  to  obtain  fscores  beyond  95  for  all  the  classifiers  for  the  data  corresponding  to  light,  its  binary  nature  makes  impossible  to  use  it  to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  in  the  area  under  study,  thus  it  was  discarded.  summarises  both  the  parameters  and  the  fscores  obtained  using  the  default  values  for  said  parameters,  and  after  tweaking  them.  concerning  the  analysis  of  the  temperature  data  using  the  default
__label__environmentmonitoring parameters  for  each  classifier,  the  following  fscores  results  were  obtained:  24.43  for  lr,  24.90  for  svm,  and  25.15  for  ann.  these  results  are  far  away  from  what  we  had  expected,  thus  an  additional  tweaking  of  the  parameter  was  applied  in  order  to  improve  the  fscores.  in  the  best  scenario,  the  following  fscores  results  were  obtained:  29.43  more  5  for  lr;  29.72  more  4.82  for  svm;  and  28.70  more  3.55  in  the  case  of  ann.  fscore  results  of  parameters  for  lr,  svm,  and  ann  for  the  multiclass  problem.  the  results  obtained  for  the  multiclass  problem  show  that  it  was  not  possible
__label__environmentmonitoring to  estimate  the  number  of  occupants  using  just  the  temperature  data.  when  the  default  parameters  were  used,  all  the  classifiers  reported  almost  the  same  fscores,  i.e.,  around  24.5.  after  changing  the  parameters,  the  svm  classifier  produced  the  best  results  for  this  dataset,  around  29.72.  it  was  also  assumed  that  the  human  body  surface  had  a  uniform  temperature  and  a  consistent  heat  production,  but  this  is  not  necessarily  true.  the  human  body  has  a  distinct  physical  shape  and  also  has  multiple  thermophysiological  properties.  thus,  it  is  difficult  to  include  those  factors  in  a  numerical  constant  in  an  indoor  space.  a  valid
__label__environmentmonitoring estimation  of  the  number  of  occupants  in  indoor  environments  using  nonintrusive  environmental  sensors  requires  a  deep  study  of  the  correlation  of  the  data  gathered.  ml  techniques  have  proven  to  be  useful  to  better  understand  the  interaction  and  behavior  between  the  sensors,  according  to  the  changes  induced  by  the  occupants  in  indoor  environments.  for  the  multiclass  problem,  the  correlation  between  light,  temperature,  and  co  looks  promising.  in  a  first  step,  the  analysis  of  the  light  could  determine  accurately  the  presence  or  absence  of  occupants,  and,  as  a  second  step,  a  study  of  the  correlation  between  temperature  and  co  could  enhance  the
__label__environmentmonitoring estimation  concerning  the  number  of  occupants  in  a  specific  area.  thus,  these  open  issues  lead  to  the  possibility  to  perform  future  research  in  this  field.  nowadays,  companies  and  researchers  are  working  on  enhancing  the  quality  of  life  of  citizens,  using  the  iot  paradigm  to  reach  the  idea  of  building  smart  environments.  in  this  context,  it  would  be  beneficial  to  have  mechanisms  to  predict  or  estimate  the  occupancy  of  indoor  environments  to  make  smart  decisions  about  how  to  selfadapt  to  the  environmental  conditions.  in  this  research,  a  solution  for  occupancy  detection  with  nonintrusive  devices  using  sensors  such  as  temperature,  noise,  co
__label__environmentmonitoring ,  and  light  intensity  was  proposed  and  tested.  a  functional  system,  made  up  of  a  device  to  gather  and  process  environmental  data,  and  to  analyse  the  data  patterns  over  the  collected  data  regarding  people  occupancy  in  indoor  environments  using  ml  methods,  was  tested.  the  analysis  performed  allows  asserting  that  with  features  such  as  noise  data  in  working  environments  the  performance  of  the  recognition  system  might  be  degraded.  however,  with  features  such  as  temperature,  co  ,  and  light  data,  it  will  be  possible  to  estimate  the  detection  of  occupants  with  an  acceptable  level  of  accuracy.  thus,  the  work  done  in  this
__label__environmentmonitoring research  could  feed  thirdparty  applications  focused  on  indoor  occupancy  detection  to  generate  smart  decisions  considering  the  occupants  needs.  for  future  works,  it  is  necessary  to  study  the  full  correlation  of  the  environmental  data  used  in  this  research.  a  starting  point  could  be  the  analysis  of  features  and  their  impact  on  the  system.  the  co  data  have  to  endure  some  processing  to  find  the  most  meaningful  way  to  use  this  type  of  data,  since  it  was  found  that  they  represent  one  of  the  best  features  to  detect  the  number  of  occupants.  david  perez  abreu  wishes  to  acknowledge  the  portuguese  funding  institution
