__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  resources  and  transmission  of  measurements.  in  the  rest  of  this  section,  we  provide  some  more  details  on  the  categories  of  devices  we  have  integrated.  the  power  consumption  meters  installed  measure  the  apparent  power  and  average  power  consumption  of  a  school  building.  meters  are  situated  on  the  general  electricity  distribution  board  of  each  such  building  to  measure  each  one  of  the  threephase  power  supply  of  the  building.  these  devices  are  equipped  with  xbee  modules  in  order  to  access  the  ieee  802.15.4  network  and  transmit  the  measurements  to  cloud  services  via  the  custom  made  gateway  nodes.  for  more  details  regarding  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement design  and  technical  specification  of  the  devices  see  .  the  environmental  comfort  meters  measure  various  aspects  affecting  the  wellbeing  of  the  buildings  inhabitants,  such  as  thermal  satisfaction  with  surrounding  thermal  conditions,  visual  perception  of  available  light  comfort  and  overall  noise  exposure.  we  also  monitor  room  occupancy  using  passive  infrared  sensors  pir.  these  devices  are  also  equipped  with  xbee  modules  in  order  to  access  the  ieee  802.15.4  network  and  transmit  the  measurements  to  the  cloud  services  via  our  custommade  gateways.  for  more  details  regarding  the  design  and  technical  specification  of  the  devices  see  .  these  provide  information  on  the  outdoor  atmospheric
__label__energymonitoringmanagement conditions  including  precipitation  levels,  wind  speed  and  direction.  the  atmospheric  meters  monitor  atmospheric  pressure  and  the  concentration  of  selected  pollutants,  to  provide  insights  on  the  pollution  levels  near  school  buildings.  these  devices  communicate  with  our  system  directly  via  ethernet  or  wifi  and  are  powered  using  poweroverethernet  or  are  plugged  into  the  sockets  of  the  building  when  available.  for  more  details  regarding  the  design  and  technical  specification  of  the  devices  see  .  in  certain  locations  where  the  installation  of  our  custom  devices  was  not  feasible  due  to  connectivity  or  other  restrictions,  we  have  installed  a  number  of  meazon  power  meters  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement sensors.  these  sensors  communicate  with  meazons  proprietary  data  infrastructure  and  their  data  are  then  pushed  to  our  platform.  on  the  hardware  side,  these  devices  communicate  using  zigbee  to  a  central  gateway  device  that  is  either  connected  to  the  internet  via  ethernet  or  use  3g  in  order  to  communicate  directly  with  meazons  proprietary  cloud  services.  similarly,  in  some  of  the  buildings  instead  of  our  custom  weather  stations,  we  used  some  offtheself  synfield  weather  stations  that  offered  us  wifi  connectivity  to  avoid  installing  additional  cables  on  the  roofs  of  the  buildings,  as  well  as  energy  harvesting  via  solar  panels.  in  this  case,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  weather  stations  communicate  via  wifi  directly  to  proprietary  cloud  services.  in  one  of  the  schools  involved  a  large  technical  high  school/college  a  bms  was  already  in  place,  utilized  by  the  building  manager  and  other  technical  staff  to  monitor  and  control  several  aspects  of  the  daytoday  business.  however,  this  system  provided  little  to  none  standard  interfaces  to  external  systems.  to  integrate  its  infrastructure  to  our  system  a  custom  application  was  developed  to  poll  periodically  the  collected  data  directly  from  the  applications  database  and  transmit  the  data  to  ourplatform.  our  platform  provides  a  unified  api  for  retrieving  data  from  multiple  sites
__label__energymonitoringmanagement and  multiple  hardware  platforms  with  transparency.  each  hardware  device  integrated  in  the  platform  is  mapped  to  a  resource  .  resources  are  selfdescribed  entities  and  are  also  software/hardware  agnostic.  the  data  api  acts  as  a  wrapper  function  and  hides  much  of  the  lowerlevel  plumbing  of  hardware  specific  api  calls  for  querying  and  retrieving  data,  providing  a  common  api  for  retrieving  historical  or  realtime  data  fromresources.  to  facilitate  integration  between  the  existing  hardware  and  software  technologies,  the  exchange  of  the  information  occurs  through  api  mappers  .  the  api  mapper  acts  as  a  translation  proxy  for  data  acquisition  and  it  is  responsible  for
__label__energymonitoringmanagement polling  the  devices  infrastructure  through  proprietary  apis  and  translating  the  received  measurements  in  a  ready  to  process  form  for  the  platform.  in  general,  the  api  mapper  transforms  data  to  and  from  the  api.  the  data  input  type  can  be,  based  on  each  devices  capabilities,  either  poll  based  and/or  pushbased.  in  more  detail,  the  api  mapper  is  capable  of  receiving  data  from  the  iot  devices  but  also  of  sending  messages/commands  to  the  devices.  furthermore,  according  to  the  system  design,  the  api  mappers  introduce  scalability  and  modularity  in  the  platform.  our  solution  offers  two  separate  types  of  api  mappers  for  integration  with
__label__energymonitoringmanagement external  services  and  to  retrieve  iot  sensor  data:  a  polling  api  mapper  and  b  message  queue  api  mapper.  both  solutions  will  be  used  in  order  to  integrate  with  data  originating  from  iot  installation.  the  first  solution  polling  api  mapper  is  based  on  polling.  a  usage  example  is  the  following:  weather  stations  are  installed  in  a  subset  of  school  buildings  of  the  project.  data  produced  by  such  stations  are  accessible  through  the  weather  application  that  provides  historical  information  through  a  restful  api  provided  by  the  weather  backend.  in  order  to  integrate  them  into  the  system  presented  here,  the  weather  api  mapper
__label__energymonitoringmanagement was  implemented  for  the  weather  api  based  on  the  polling  api  mapper.  the  weather  api  is  polled  every  fixed  number  of  minutes  5  for  updated  data.  when  new  data  is  found,  it  is  formatted  to  the  internal  format  of  the  platform  and  forwarded  to  the  processing/analytics  engine  for  processing  and  analysis  using  the  amqp  protocol.  the  data  is  then  processed  and  can  be  accessed  by  the  systems  data  api.  similar  implementations  based  on  the  polling  api  mapper  will  be  used  to  integrate  iot  devices  provided  by  third  parties  and  the  existing  bmss  installed  in  schoolbuildings.  the  second  solution  is  used
__label__energymonitoringmanagement when  a  pub/sub  solution  exists  in  the  external  service  that  is  going  to  be  integrated.  in  that  case,  the  external  service  is  capable  of  publishing  the  iot  data  generated  or  gathered  to  an  mqtt  endpoint.  the  api  mapper  is  then  able  to  receive  new  measurements  asynchronously  and  format  them  to  the  internal  format  of  our  platform.  the  data  is  then  forwarded  to  the  systems  processing/analytics  engine  for  processing  and  analysis  using  the  amqp  protocol.  thedata  is  then  processed  and  can  be  accessed  from  the  systems  data  api.  messages  inside  the  mqtt  broker  can  be  transferred  in  multiple  formats  ranging  from
__label__energymonitoringmanagement plain  text  to  any  open  or  proprietary  protocol.  in  our  case  messages  are  transmitted  in  plain  text  following  a  simple  format:  the  topic  of  the  message  refers  to  the  device  and  sensor  that  generated  the  message  while  the  actual  payload  represents  the  value  generated.  for  example,  if  a  sensor  with  a  hardware  mac  address  publishes  a  temperature  value  of  20  degrees,  the  topic  is  and  the  message  .  all  sensors  forward  their  measurements  periodically  every  30  s  or  on  events  i.e.,  when  motion  is  detected  and  the  api  mapper  receives  and  forwards  them  to  the  processing  engine.  the  evaluation  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  systems  operation  focuses  on  the  following  areas:  1  data  processing,  2  data  access,  and,  3  data  analysis  and  statistics.  these  areas  can  adversely  affect  the  performance  and  perception  of  a  system  since  users  need  rich  data,  easily  and  quickly  accessible  and  realtime  information  to  better  understand  how  their  actions  affect  the  building  usage.  this  is  more  crucial  when  the  data  is  used  in  the  educational  context,  i.e.,  during  courses.  to  better  present  the  operation  and  capabilities  of  the  system,  an  analysis  of  the  average  weekly  occupancy  of  4  distinct  school  buildings  during  may  2017  is  presented  in  this  section.
__label__energymonitoringmanagement remark  that  this  analysis  is  similar  to  the  work  presented  in  .  depicts  the  occupancy  levels  of  the  whole  building,  as  an  aggregated  occupancy  of  all  the  rooms  in  which  a  smart  motion  sensors  is  installed.  all  four  buildings  are  elementary  schools  that  follow  the  same  academic  schedule  with  activities  starting  from  08:00  until  13:30.  remark  that  the  building  of  school  1  is  also  used  by  a  technical  school  that  is  used  in  the  afternoon.  the  data  presented  are  ranged  from  0  no  motion  detected  during  this  time  interval  to  1  constant  motion  was  detected  during  the  whole  time  period.
__label__energymonitoringmanagement this  graph  shows  the  actual  active  hours  of  the  schools  that  are  commonly  ranged  between  7:00  and  15:00  during  weekdays.  it  also  depicts  the  clear  differences  between  schools  of  different  levels,  e.g.,  the  case  of  school  1  where  a  technical  school  has  class  hours  also  in  the  afternoon.  fourweek  may  2017  average  occupancy  levels  in  four  different  school  buildings.  similarly,  presents  the  average  power  consumption  of  a  school  as  it  is  measured  by  our  system,  versus  the  occupancy  of  the  building.  from  the  graph,  it  is  clear  that  the  school  building  consumes  power  mainly  when  it  is  occupied  during  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement weekdays.  fourweek  may  2017  average  power  consumption  and  occupancy  levels  in  a  specific  school  building.  accessing  historical  data  is  crucial  for  building  monitoring  applications,  e.g.,  when  comparing  historical  data  from  different  time  spans  and  building  areas.  in  such  use  cases,  it  is  important  that  an  iot  service  is  capable  of  providing  these  data  without  delays,  independently  of  the  targeted  time  interval.  as  discussed  in  ,  application  response  times  larger  than  10  s  tend  to  make  users  lose  their  attention  in  the  given  task,  while  a  1  s  response  time  is  considered  the  limit  for  users  that  are  freely  navigating  an
__label__energymonitoringmanagement application  without  waiting  for  the  applications  response.  in  that  context,  when  presenting  power  consumption  statistics,  e.g.,  over  the  past  year,  it  is  important  to  be  able  to  retrieve  and  present  the  stored  values  within  one  second,  independently  of  the  requested  interval  latest  values  versus  older  values.  and  present  the  average  retrieval  times  for  accessing  historical  data  of  a  one  month  duration  for  the  past  12  months,  observing  minimal  differences  in  the  access  times  independent  of  the  period  requested.  average  response  time  for  accessing  one  month  data  for  the  past  year  daily  aggregated  values.  average  response  time  for  accessing  one  month
__label__energymonitoringmanagement data  for  the  past  year  hourly  aggregated  values.  note  that,  based  on  the  data  available  from  the  graphs,  the  systems  response  time  is  independent  of  the  actual  time  interval  while  it  is  actually  dependent  on  the  amount  of  data  requested.  this  is  more  clear  in  ,  where  response  times  tend  to  increase  as  the  response  times  increase  when  time  periods  of  more  than  9  months  of  data  are  requested.  average  response  time  for  variable  time  periods  ranging  from  one  to  12  months.  another  important  characteristic  for  evaluating  the  systems  performance  is  the  load  of  data  that  the  system  is  able
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  process  at  any  given  time.  with  the  current  setup,  the  fleet  of  buildings  in  the  system  produces  an  average  of  25  measurements  per  second.  the  data  processing  topology  currently  runs  on  a  single  core  virtual  machine  on  an  intelcorei53340  cpu  running  at  3.10  g  h  z  with  4  g  b  of  ram.  with  this  configuration  and  setup,  the  system  is  capable  of  processing  up  to  500  measurements  per  second.  to  increase  the  number  of  measurements,  the  system  can  support  two  different  options:  increase  the  computing  power  of  the  virtual  machine,  by  assigning  it  to  a  more  powerful  host  or
__label__energymonitoringmanagement giving  it  access  to  more  resources  from  the  host  machine.  deploy  a  second  instance  of  the  processing  topology  that  is  capable  of  consuming  the  same  number  of  measurements  to  reach  the  required  data  processing  rates.  based  on  the  nature  of  sensors  deployed,  the  input  data  require  three  different  types  of  aggregation:  1  averaging  for  sensors  such  as  temperature  or  relative  humidity,  2  total  for  sensors  such  as  rain  height  levels,  and  3  power  consumption  estimation  based  on  the  electrical  current  values  received  from  the  installation.  each  type  of  processing  requires  a  different  type  of  aggregation  processing  and  as  a  result
__label__energymonitoringmanagement has  a  different  average  execution  latency,  presented  in  .  execution  latency  statistics  for  the  three  different  aggregation  types  used  in  our  system.  as  previously  mentioned,  the  system  offers  a  rich  set  of  apis  to  access  the  information  of  the  deployed  sensors  as  well  as  the  data  collected  in  real  time.  these  apis  have  been  used  to  develop  multiple  applications  that  are  designed  to  help  the  building  managers,  teachers  and  students  in  their  daytoday  activities  in  the  school  buildings  educational  or  not.  among  others,  third  parties  have  developed  a  building  management  application  bms  ,  a  participatory  sensing  application,  as  well  as
__label__energymonitoringmanagement a  set  of  in  class  activities  accompanied  by  sensing  and  visualization  tools  that  help  students  better  understand  their  environment  and  the  natural  effects  monitored.  in  order  to  monitor  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  educational  buildings,  a  multischool  bms  system  has  been  developed  using  the  api  exposed  by  the  system  developed  here.  using  the  bms  system  the  building  manager  will  be  able  to  inspect  realtime  energy  usage,  inspect  results  from  a  comparison  with  similar  buildings  or  with  the  same  building  in  other  time  spans  e.g.  previous  years,  along  with  comments  and  receive  energy  efficiency  recommendations.  it  is  also  important  to  mention
__label__energymonitoringmanagement that  building  managers  are  able  to  communicate  using  the  bms  system  in  order  to  enhance  their  knowledge  of  actions  that  can  lead  to  energy  savings.  as  a  way  to  complement  existing  iot  infrastructure  and  provide  additional  data  from  the  school  buildings  monitored  by  the  system,  an  android  application  was  developed  by  a  third  party  to  provide  participatory  sensing  capabilities.  smartphones  and  tablets  are  used  to  provide  additional  readings  from  inside  the  school  building,  e.g.,  luminosity  or  noise  levels,  while  participants  can  also  manually  enter  data  such  as  electricity  meter  readings.  the  teacher  can  initiate  participatory  sensing  sessions  during  the  courses
__label__energymonitoringmanagement from  the  main  portal  of  the  project  and  then  students  can  use  phones  and  tablets  to  gather  data  in  real  time  and  then  review  them  in  class.  in  order  to  augment  the  application  set  developed  for  the  system  and  extend  its  educational  focus,  several  applications  have  been  implemented  to  support  educational  content  based  on  the  data  produced  by  the  iot  infrastructure  inside  the  monitored  school  buildings.  these  are  based  on  the  fact  that  students  are  more  driven  to  engage  in  class  activities  regarding  sustainability  and  energy  efficiency  when  the  data  utilized  originates  from  their  environment  and  are  near  realtime.  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement activities  are  built  around  a  diy  sensor  kit,  which  the  students  use  to  build  a  small  interactive  installation  that  visualizes  environmental  and  energy  consumption  data  from  school  classrooms.  in  more  detail,  students  are  able  to  start  from  building  a  simple  electrical  circuit,  using  resistors,  leds  and  motors,  and  move  progressively  to  running  and  coding  simple  application  scripts  in  python  that  communicate  with  our  system  to  retrieve  the  sensed  values  of  their  surroundings.  these  values  are  visualized  using  the  leds  or  the  motors  and  students  can  then  see  how  their  actions  inside  the  classrooms  and  their  school  affects  their  surroundings.  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement total  amount  of  energy  spent  in  our  everyday  life  residential  use,  personal  transportation,  etc.  is  quite  significant,  reaching  up  to  40  of  the  worlds  total  energy  usage.  in  this  context,  reducing  energy  use  in  buildings  by  introducing  new  technologies  is  very  challenging;  across  europe,  the  rates  of  new  buildings  construction  as  well  as  the  rates  of  renovation  of  existing  buildings  are  both  generally  very  low.  similarly,  energy  consumption  in  transportation  is  growing  annually,  also  making  it  very  challenging  to  save  energy  in  this  sector.  therefore,  it  is  evident  that,  in  order  to  achieve  the  ambitious  energy  and  climate  targets  for
__label__energymonitoringmanagement 2020  and  beyond,  we  need  a  change  in  citizens  behaviour  and  consumption  practices.  reports  indicate  that  citizens  making  efficient  use  of  energy  in  their  everyday  life  can  lead  to  large  energy  and  financial  savings  and  potentially  to  a  substantially  positive  environmental  impact.  this  work  adopts  a  holistic  approach  towards  designing  an  efficient  system  together  with  a  sustainable  vision,  utilising  iot  infrastructures  combined  with  a  diverse  set  of  feedback  and  interface  mechanisms,  in  order  to  engage  its  endusers  in  longterm  behavioural  changes.  the  system  is  deployed  in  school  buildings  in  several  countries  representing  south,  central  and  northern  european  areas,  with  both
__label__energymonitoringmanagement cultural  and  geographical  diversity.  the  system  is  developed  based  on  opensource  technologies  and  services  in  order  to  make  the  system  open  to  provide  an  open  itinfrastructure  capable  of  supporting  different  commercial  hardware/sensor  vendors  as  well  as  opensource  solutions.  the  system  presented  can  be  used  to  develop  and  offer  new  appbased  solutions  that  can  be  used  either  for  educational  purposes  or  for  managing  the  energy  efficiency  of  the  building.  the  system  is  replicable  and  adaptable  to  settings  that  may  be  different  than  the  scenarios  envisioned  here  e.g.,  targeting  different  climate  zones,  different  it  infrastructures  and  can  be  easily  extended  to  accommodate
__label__energymonitoringmanagement integration  with  other  systems.  the  performance  evaluation  presented  is  evaluated  in  realworld  environment  comprised  of  13  school  buildings  and  including  700  iot  endpoints.  the  overall  performance  analysis  demonstrate  its  scalability,  responsiveness  and  versatility  in  accomodating  different  application  needs.  the  results  show  that  the  system  is  highly  efficient,  by  handling  the  respective  building  data  loads  almost  in  real  time  using  typical  server  resources,  and  responsive,  with  an  application  response  time  less  than  2  s,  despite  the  large  scale  of  the  iot  deployment  inside  the  educational  buildings  monitored.  in  particular  the  system  is  capable  of  processing  the  data  arriving  from  all  13
__label__energymonitoringmanagement buildings  using  a  single  core  virtual  machine  on  an  intelcorei53340  cpu  running  at  3.10  g  h  z  with  4  g  b  of  ram.  with  this  configuration  and  setup,  the  system  is  capable  of  processing  up  to  500  measurements  per  second.  interestingly,  the  use  of  opensource  technologies  to  create  an  open  design  platform  does  not  limit  the  overall  performance  of  the  system.  the  systems  usage  in  order  to  accomodate  a  larger  number  of  buildings  can  rely  on  additional  resources  at  the  cloud  level  where  the  virtual  machine  is  executed.  alternatively,  by  adopting  the  fog  computing  paradigm,  see  e.g.  ,  separate  virtual
__label__energymonitoringmanagement machines  can  be  distributed  to  each  building  that  act  as  the  iot  gateways  and  accomodate  the  needs  of  each  separate  building  without  increasing  the  overall  costs  of  the  cloud  infrastructure.  a  key  requirement  of  a  system  targeting  the  educational  sector  is  the  ability  to  address  the  needs  of  diverse  user  groups  such  as  building  managers,  teachers  and  students  in  their  daytoday  activities  in  the  school  buildings  educational  or  not.  the  system  presented  here  offers  a  rich  set  of  apis  to  access  the  information  of  the  deployed  sensors  as  well  as  the  data  collected  in  real  time.  a  number  of  different
__label__energymonitoringmanagement applications  were  presented  that  target  building  managers  e.g.,  such  as  the  bms  application,  applications  that  augment  the  inclass  activities  and  extend  the  educational  content  based  on  the  data  produced  by  the  iot  infrastructure  as  well  as  mobile  applications  that  offer  participatory  sensing  capabilities  that  allow  the  teachers  to  engage  students  in  diverse  activities  that  span  also  outside  school  hours.  it  is  therefore  evident  that  providing  a  concrete  group  of  apis  is  critical  for  supporing  the  development  of  multiple  applications  that  are  designed  to  help  the  different  types  of  users  and  also  allow  thirdparty  applications.  in  terms  of  future  work,  it
__label__energymonitoringmanagement is  important  to  further  extend  the  capabilities  of  the  system,  mostly  through  extending  the  set  of  applications  built  around  it,  e.g.,  gamification  and  other  applications  supporting  educational  aspects.  another  direction  of  work  is  to  provide  open  datasets,  produced  by  the  systems  application  in  reallife  settings  in  the  educational  domain.  these  datasets  will  allow  the  buildings  operations  analysis  not  only  in  terms  of  energy  consumption  but  also  in  terms  of  ambient  environmental  conditions  with  possible  connections  to  the  educational  activities.  remark  that  such  datadriven  analysis  of  the  operation  of  the  educational  sector  does  not  exist  at  this  point.  providing  evidence  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement such  aspects  of  the  educational  activities  is  crucial  to  improving  the  overall  quality  and  performance  of  schools.  finally,  extending  the  iot  infrastructure  in  order  to  provide  data  through  the  integration  of  additional  school  buildings  is  also  an  important  future  work  direction.  this  work  has  been  partially  supported  in  the  context  of  the  green  awareness  in  action  gaia  project,  funded  by  the  european  commission  under  the  h2020ee20152ria  call  and  contract  number  696029  and  the  research  project  designing  humanagent  collectives  for  sustainable  future  societies  c26a15txcf  of  sapienza  university  of  rome.  d.a,  o.a.,  g.m.  and  i.c.,  conceived  and  designed  the  system,  provided  the

__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  last  few  years.  iot  is  the  paradigm  that  creates  an  internetconnected  world,  where  all  the  everyday  objects  capture  data  from  our  environment  and  adapt  it  to  our  needs.  however,  the  implementation  of  iot  is  a  challenging  task  and  all  the  implementation  scenarios  require  the  use  of  different  technologies  and  the  emergence  of  new  ones,  such  as  edge  computing  ec.  ec  allows  for  more  secure  and  efficient  data  processing  in  real  time,  achieving  better  performance  and  results.  energy  efficiency  is  one  of  the  most  interesting  iot  scenarios.  in  this  scenario  sensors,  actuators  and  smart  devices  interact  to  generate  a  large
__label__energymonitoringmanagement volume  of  data  associated  with  energy  consumption.  this  work  proposes  the  use  of  an  edgeiot  platform  and  a  social  computing  framework  to  build  a  system  aimed  to  smart  energy  efficiency  in  a  public  building  scenario.  the  system  has  been  evaluated  in  a  public  building  and  the  results  make  evident  the  notable  benefits  that  come  from  applying  edge  computing  to  both  energy  efficiency  scenarios  and  the  framework  itself.  those  benefits  included  reduced  data  transfer  from  the  iotedge  to  the  cloud  and  reduced  cloud,  computing  and  network  resource  costs.  cloud  computing  has  become  a  means  of  consolidating  computing  functions,  storage  and  network
__label__energymonitoringmanagement management  centrally  .  unfortunately,  architectures  based  exclusively  on  a  centralized  cloud  experience  many  difficulties  because  they  cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the  internet  of  things  iot  paradigm,  of  current  mobile  internet  applications,  nor  can  they  support  the  the  massive  volume  of  data  these  applications  generate.  the  users  of  iot  applications  look  for  realtime  response;  such  features  add  more  burden  to  the  networks,  resulting  in  increased  latency  as  well  as  storage  and  high  bandwidth  costs  .  other  features  that  an  iot  cloud  architecture  cannot  easily  deal  with  include  :  security  and  integrity  of  data  coming  from  edge  devices;  iot  devices  heterogeneity
__label__energymonitoringmanagement sensors,  actuators,  smartphones,  tablets,  smart  bracelets,  laptops,  etc.  with  limited  storage  and  processing  resources;  uninterrupted,  realtime  service  requests  and  responses.  these  characteristics  have  been  the  motivation  behind  research  which  proposed  edge  computing  as  an  alternative  means  of  processing  and  filtering  big  data  at  the  edge  of  the  network  before  transmitting  it  to  the  cloud;  the  benefits  of  this  include  reduced  bandwidth  costs,  storage  and  energy  consumption  .  therefore,  by  integrating  an  iotbased  edge  computing  architecture,  applications  and  services  provide  users  with  faster,  more  efficient  and  secure  responses  .  smart  energy  is  one  of  the  scenarios  in  which  iot  is  applied
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  achieve  efficient  energy  use;  this  topic  has  been  discussed  in  more  detail  in  .  countries,  industries,  universities  have  developed  research  in  energy  efficiency  to  obtain  applications  capable  of  controlling,  measuring  and  managing  energy  consumption  in  buildings,  grids,  and  households.  furthermore,  countless  research  has  provided  new  hardware  solutions  sensors,  controllers  or  smart  meters  .  despite  the  efforts  done  to  make  users  understand  the  importance  of  reducing  energy  consumption  in  public  spaces,  work  environments,  or  at  home,  this  problem  continues  and  it  is  necessary  to  find  a  solution  to  it  ,  .  the  uncontrolled  consumption  and  waste  of  energy  is  most
__label__energymonitoringmanagement noticeable  in  public  spaces;  there  are  several  reasons  for  this:  there  are  many  different  users  with  different  preferences/comfort  requirements,  very  old  buildings  and  the  lack  of  resources  for  the  implementation  of  new  technology  that  would  adapt  to  their  infrastructure  .  several  authors  have  proposed  solutions  to  motivate,  educate  and  raise  awareness  among  users  about  the  importance  of  smart  energy  consumption  ,  .  in  this  regard,  serious  games  are  one  of  the  solutions  proposed  to  improve  user  behaviour  and  these  have  been  presented  and  analyzed  in  numerous  research  ,  .  although  there  is  a  variety  of  proposals,  most  of  them  only
__label__energymonitoringmanagement contemplate  the  use  of  serious  games  in  homes  ,  and  they  do  not  incorporate  features  such  as  sensor  technologies  ,  identification  and  location  of  users  in  realtime,  or  iot  devices  that  improve  user  interaction  .  an  interesting  proposal  has  been  presented  by  garca  et  al.  ,  where  the  cafcla  framework  contextaware  framework  for  collaborative  learning  activities  has  been  used  to  implement  a  serious  game  based  on  social  computing  in  an  office  environment.  the  main  objective  of  the  game  proposed  by  garca  et  al.  is  to  change  the  behaviour  of  users  by  acquiring  good  energy  consumption  habits  in  a  natural  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement progressive  way.  this  research  analyzed  the  cafcla  framework  and  its  weaknesses  in  the  face  of  a  large  volume  of  data  generated  by  users  and  iot  devices.  in  this  context,  cafcla  has  been  integrated  with  an  edge  computing  architecture,  with  the  aim  of  conducting  a  case  study  in  a  public  building  and  evaluating  its  performance.  the  public  building  in  which  this  case  study  has  been  conducted  was  the  laboratory  of  the  bisite  research  group  of  the  university  of  salamanca  spain.  the  rest  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  presents  a  review  of  the  state  of  the  art  of  edge  computing,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement iot  technologies  and  smart  energy  scenarios;  it  also  addresses  the  research  works  in  which  iot  has  been  incorporated  in  smart  grids,  domestic,  commercial  and  public  environments.  describes  geca,  a  global  edge  computing  architecture,  and  how  it  can  be  integrated  with  cafcla  to  improve  this  framework.  details  a  use  case  and  describes  the  experiment  and  its  results.  finally,  draws  the  main  conclusions  and  describes  future  lines  of  research.  over  the  last  few  years,  there  has  been  a  great  increase  solutions  that  decentralize  communications,  data  collection  and  processing,  moving  all  those  tasks  to  the  edge  .  this  trend  has  led  the  emergence
__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  the  edge  computing  paradigm  ,  ,  whose  basis  is  enabling  technologies  that  perform  computation  at  the  edge  of  the  network  .  in  this  way,  computing  and  network  resources  edges  are  closer  to  the  source  of  the  data  than  to  the  cloud  data  centers  .  edge  computing  allows  for  improving  the  performance  of  computer  systems  by  lowering  latency,  reducing  the  cost  of  resources  and  increasing  responsiveness,  scalability,  reliability,  security  or  privacy  .  the  internet  of  the  things  iot  is  a  wellknown  technology  and  a  broad  research  topic  that  has  become  a  reference  for  data  collection  and  processing  systems  .  iot
__label__energymonitoringmanagement systems  are  formed  by  multiple  and  heterogeneous  devices  sensors,  vehicles,  machinery,  appliances,  meters,  etc.  connected  through  different  communication  protocols  .  multiple  disciplines  benefit  form  iot  solutions  such  as  industry  4.0  ,  ,  energy  efficiency  ,  ,  smart  homes  ,  ,  smart  cities  ,  or  healthcare  .  the  management  of  iot  networks  is  challenging  because  of  the  heterogeneity  of  its  resources,  creating  difficulties  in  communication  protocols,  realtime  processes,  data  management,  big  data  storage,  security  or  privacy.  in  this  regard,  edge  computing  architectures  offer  a  solution  to  iot  infrastructures  because  they  are  capable  of  managing  the  heterogeneous  data  generated  by  iot  devices
__label__energymonitoringmanagement ,  .  gives  an  example  of  a  basic  threelayered  edge  computing  architecture  :  layer  1iot  sensors:  this  layer  includes  iot  devices  sensors,  smart  meters,  smart  plugs,  etc.  as  well  as  users.  the  first  layer  is  responsible  for  the  ingestion  of  data  and  the  operations  involved.  layer  2edge  nodes:  the  second  layer  is  formed  by  edge  nodes.  these  nodes  are  responsible  of  data  processing,  routing  and  computing  operations.  layer  3cloud  services:  this  layer  is  formed  by  multiple  cloud  services  with  higher  computational  requirements.  this  layer  is  responsible  for  data  analytics,  artificial  intelligence,  machine  learning,  or  visualization,  among  other  tasks.  threelayer  edge
__label__energymonitoringmanagement computing  basic  architecture.  as  mentioned  above,  smart  energy  environments  can  benefit  from  iot  approaches.  monitoring  energy  consumption  and  other  parameters  allows  for  a  40  reduction  of  energy  consumption  .  sensors  and  intelligent  devices  have  transformed  the  energy  industry  by  allowing  to  get  a  deeper  understanding  of  how  energy  is  spent  and  what  factors  influence  its  consumption.  there  are  a  large  number  of  proposals  and  approaches  in  the  literature  that  address  this  problem,  although  they  all  have  different  objectives,  such  as  achieving  better  efficiency  and  resource  management  ,  reducing  carbon  emissions  and  costs  ,  improving  demand  response  dr  systems  ,  or
__label__energymonitoringmanagement improving  knowledge  and  system  automation  by  data  correlation  such  as  temperature,  humidity,  luminosity  or  other  sensors,  weather  information,  user,  segment  and  building  profiles,  etc.  .  due  to  the  wide  variety  of  the  proposed  solutions,  and  above  all,  the  multiple  application  areas,  the  state  of  the  art  presented  here  includes  the  most  outstanding  works  in  three  different  areas,  smart  grids,  industrial  and  commercial  environments  and  domestic  environments.  energy  distribution  networks  have  great  potential  in  terms  of  data  analysis.  the  optimization  of  energy  production  and  demand  poses  a  great  challenge  for  researchers.  as  a  result,  we  find  numerous  works  in  the  state
__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  the  art  that  address  those  topics.  there  is  a  rise  in  the  use  of  renewable  energy  sources  and  there  is  an  increasing  number  of  energy  production  and  selfconsumption  solutions  for  homes  and  businesses.  many  research  works  have  focused  on  the  importance  of  reducing  energy  loss  and  how  this  contributes  to  energy  efficiency  of  the  system  and,  therefore,  in  the  price  of  energy  .  in  this  sense,  the  implementation  of  smart  grids  must  be  addressed  from  different  perspectives,  such  as  distributed  generation  dg  or  realtime  pricing  rtp  programs  .  solutions  offer  different  approaches  to  the  optimization  of  demand  response  ,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement ,  .  one  of  the  main  problems  to  be  solved  is  the  optimization  of  a  distributed  model  that  encourages  as  many  users  as  possible  to  participate  in  demand  response  programs.  yaghmaee  et  al.  present  a  cloudbased  demand  response  model  that  deals  with  communication  networks  and  message  management.  this  model  has  an  edge  computing  approach;  it  uses  cloud  services  in  order  to  optimize  the  communication  between  the  different  stakeholders.  however,  the  design  does  not  provide  any  security  to  the  communications,  since  it  uses  udp.  furthermore,  the  management  of  edge  nodes  or  the  inclusion  of  sensors  that  optimize  the  collection  of  information
__label__energymonitoringmanagement are  not  considered  by  yaghmaee  et  al.  .  all  these  aspects  are  covered  in  our  proposal  because  it  combines  the  cafcla  framework  and  the  geca  architecture.  moreover,  the  authors  of  naranjo  et  al.  affirm  that  the  computational  requirements  of  smart  grids  may  be  moved  to  the  edge  of  the  network.  in  connection  to  this  statement,  their  research  proposes  the  deployment  of  smartlocalgrids  slg  as  a  communication  paradigm  between  microgrids.  this  solution  makes  it  possible  for  the  nodes  to  collect  data  and  transport  it  to  a  remote  cloud  where  an  indepth  analysis  is  carried  out,  and  in  their  work  naranjo  et
__label__energymonitoringmanagement al.  include  an  analysis  of  how  the  support  of  the  entire  infrastructure  should  be  managed  with  the  model  they  present.  similarly,  the  article  presents  a  system  that  is  compatible  with  iot  models.  however,  this  proposal  also  has  some  security  and  reliability  limitations.  in  this  regard,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that,  by  using  the  geca  architecture  in  our  proposal,  both  aspects  are  covered,  even  with  the  inclusion  of  blockchain  capabilities.  due  to  the  need  to  manage  multiple  devices  connected  to  the  smart  grid,  shahryari  and  anvarimoghaddam  included  bidirectional  information  and  energy  flow  to  facilitate  the  development  of  smart  energy  networks.  in
__label__energymonitoringmanagement their  proposal,  they  address  the  problems  associated  with  managing  a  large  number  of  connected  devices  and  the  massive  volume  of  data  generated  by  them,  as  well  as  the  problems  related  to  the  transmission,  processing  and  storage  of  data.  to  overcome  those  challenges,  they  propose  to  process  data  at  the  edge,  improving  performance  and  reducing  the  volume  of  transmitted  data.  they  solve  this  problem  with  a  smart  gateway  between  the  edge  and  the  cloud  that  manages  the  demand  side  dynamically.  one  of  the  weak  points  of  this  research  is  that  it  does  not  ensure  the  reliability  of  the  data  received  from
__label__energymonitoringmanagement different  sources.  the  proposal  presented  in  this  paper  ensures  the  reliability  of  data  through  the  use  of  blockchain.  moreover,  al  faruque  and  vatanparvar  affirm  in  their  work  that  energy  management  is  necessary  to  address  generation  and  consumption  control  in  microgrids,  in  residential,  industrial  and  commercial  scenarios.  in  their  work,  they  address  the  need  to  provide  scalable  solutions  for  more  efficient  management  of  iot  resources.  in  this  regard,  they  present  an  opensource  edge  computing  platform  that  facilitates  the  implementation  of  energy  management  services  and  personalized  control  services.  their  platform  has  been  applied  in  the  domestic  sphere  and  in  a  public  administration.
__label__energymonitoringmanagement however,  the  platform  does  not  provide  the  necessary  security  nor  does  it  facilitate  the  inclusion  of  thirdparty  technologies  in  an  easy  and  transparent  way.  in  this  regard,  cafcla  made  it  possible  to  include  thirdparty  technologies  while  geca  implements  a  set  of  security  features.  in  addition,  the  article  of  li  et  al.  addresses  demand  response  dr  management  using  iot  devices.  this  work  looks  specifically  at  the  security  component.  to  overcome  the  problems  of  fraud  in  energy  networks,  the  authors  propose  an  edge  computing  scheme  for  secure  demand  response  fog  computing  enabled  secure  demand  responsefsdr.  nonetheless,  their  solution  only  addresses  security  algorithms
__label__energymonitoringmanagement and  management  and  doesnt  take  into  account  the  implementation  of  blockchain  as  geca  does.  the  research  that  have  been  mentioned  in  this  section  are  only  a  small  example  of  how  edge  computing  helps  solve  dr  model  problems.  all  of  them  make  evident  the  importance  of  moving  processing  and  communication  to  the  edge  in  order  to  ingest  more  data  and  achieve  a  higher  quality  of  data,  optimizing  scalability,  security  and  management  of  energy  sources  and  consumption.  the  great  proliferation  of  low  cost  iot  devices,  as  well  as  the  implementation  of  smart  meters  have  facilitated  the  emergence  of  numerous  solutions  that  seek
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  make  the  use  of  energy  in  homes  more  efficient.  in  this  respect,  the  availability  of  edge  computing  solutions  to  this  problem  becomes  key  due  to  the  huge  amount  of  heterogeneous  data  sources  that  have  to  be  managed  in  such  a  scenario  .  among  the  multiple  approaches  that  we  have  evaluated,  yassine  et  al.  discusses  the  requirements  and  components  of  an  iot  system  for  information  capturing  in  smart  homes.  among  its  priorities  is  the  identification  of  daily  activities  that  allow  for  the  optimization  of  available  energy  resources.  in  this  sense,  the  solution  offers  an  edge  computing  platform  designed  to  implement
__label__energymonitoringmanagement multiple  services.  although  this  approach  is  very  interesting,  the  work  is  still  in  a  preliminary  state  and  has  not  yet  covered  some  aspects  such  as  the  security  inherent  to  platforms  with  technologies  such  as  blockchain,  or  how  the  platform  could  be  extrapolated  to  other  areas  such  as  the  commercial  sector.  all  these  aspects  are  covered  by  the  proposal  described  in  this  paper.  xia  et  al.  proposes  an  energy  management  framework  based  on  edge  computing.  the  main  focus  of  this  research  is  the  amortization  of  deployed  iot  devices  to  obtain  efficient  energy  savings.  it  proposes  a  strategy  of  programming  the  optimum
__label__energymonitoringmanagement operating  time  for  each  device,  taking  into  account  the  users  preferences.  despite  its  good  results,  its  solution  only  covers  this  specific  case  of  use,  making  it  difficult  to  extrapolate  it  to  other  energy  efficiency  environments.  in  this  regard,  the  implementation  by  means  of  the  cafcla  framework  in  our  proposal  facilitates  the  design  and  application  of  similar  solutions  across  different  scenarios.  on  the  other  hand,  chakraborty  and  datta  proposes  a  home  automation  solution  through  the  use  of  edge  computing,  virtual  iot  devices  and  iot.  their  solution  addresses  very  important  issues  in  this  area,  such  as  the  existence  of  multiple  iot  standards,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  heterogeneity  of  iot  devices  and  noninteroperability  of  existing  solutions.  they  present  a  smart  home  architecture  that  covers  these  issues  and  how  it  might  be  implemented.  however,  there  are  no  specific  sensor  implementations  designated  for  increasing  energy  efficiency.  in  addition,  zhou  and  zhang  proposes  a  system  based  on  edge  computing  for  electrical  demand  forecasting  in  smart  homes.  their  system  uses  an  intelligent  edge  node  that  stores  heterogeneous  data,  although  processing  and  analysis  are  done  in  the  cloud.  in  addition,  the  system  collects  environmental  data  from  other  iot  devices,  demonstrating  a  better  quality  of  service  and  greater  scalability  of  computing  resources
__label__energymonitoringmanagement thanks  to  the  edgecomputing  approach.  however,  this  approach  is  not  considered  from  the  perspective  of  users  and  does  not  mention  the  benefits  that  users  enjoy  in  the  different  scenarios.  this  is  another  element  that  we  have  achieved  in  our  work  by  means  of  cafcla.  commercial  and  public  building  environments  are  a  sector  in  which  energy  efficiency  has  become  necessary.  carbon  emissions  reduction  and  the  price  of  energy  are  two  of  the  main  factors  that  cause  companies  and  administrations  to  opt  for  the  use  of  technology  to  reduce  their  energy  consumption.  as  on  previous  occasions,  the  approaches  to  solve  this  problem
__label__energymonitoringmanagement are  numerous.  below,  we  briefly  describe  some  of  the  most  relevant  ones,  which  highlight  the  importance  of  having  complete  edge  computing  architectures  for  optimal  deployment  and  full  use  of  the  technology.  garca  et  al.  uses  cafcla  in  order  to  improve  energy  efficiency  in  public  buildings.  they  use  this  framework  to  deploy  a  serious  game  for  increased  energy  savings.  the  game  integrates  multiple  technologies  that  provide  contextawareness  and  social  computing  capabilities.  it  includes  iot  devices  and  realtime  location  identification,  measuring  and  targeting  social  interactions.  although  this  is  a  novel  approach  and  uses  iot  technology  to  ingest  information,  most  of  the  processing
__label__energymonitoringmanagement is  done  in  a  centralized  server.  in  addition,  it  does  not  cover  security  issues  or  compare  total  savings  with  other  buildings  or  solutions.  this  paper  improves  cafcla  by  combining  it  with  the  geca  architecture.  fotopoulou  et  al.  considers  that  the  deployment  of  innovative  solutions  in  smart  buildings  allows  for  achieving  significant  reductions  in  energy  consumption.  for  this,  the  adoption  of  energy  efficiency  techniques  and  the  active  participation  of  the  occupants  is  necessary.  their  solution  presents  an  ecosystem  with  energy  awareness  that  allows  for  the  development  of  customized  energy  management  services.  the  combination  of  iot  and  edge  computing  techniques  allows  them
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  present  an  open  and  extensible  architecture  capable  of  exploiting  in  a  homogeneous,  efficient  and  scalable  way  a  large  amount  of  energy,  environmental  and  behavioural  data.  the  present  paper  improves  this  approach  by,  for  example,  including  blockchain  technologies  for  their  implementation  in  realtime  locating  systems.  in  ,  the  authors  develop  a  solution  that  implements  iot  devices  and  machine  learning  algorithms  to  create  a  predictive  model  for  forecast  indoor  temperature  in  smart  buildings.  since  temperature  control  is  key  in  the  conservation  of  energy  in  buildings,  the  work  proposes  edge  computing  as  the  premises  on  which  the  system  is  developed.  although  this
__label__energymonitoringmanagement solution  potentially  makes  it  possible  to  achieve  energy  efficiency  in  buildings  management,  it  does  not  define  or  implement  the  edge  architecture,  an  aspect  that  is  covered  in  this  work  through  the  integration  of  geca  and  all  its  features.  one  of  the  works  evaluated  is  that  presented  by  khanna  et  al.  .  the  authors  describe  several  architectures  and  frameworks  that  facilitate  the  development  of  intelligent  structures  for  smart  buildings.  their  work  highlights  the  importance  of  iot  architectures  in  the  conservation  of  energy.  this  work  doesnt  present  a  solution  as  such,  but  its  conclusions  show  that  architectures  such  as  geca  are  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement vital  importance  in  smart  buildings  environments.  finally,  ferrndezpastor  et  al.  presents  an  edge  computing  solution  that  integrates  iot  devices  with  soc  system  on  a  chip  capacity  for  the  design  of  smart  buildings.  the  authors  consider  the  integration  of  different  systems,  such  as  monitoring  energy  consumption,  temperature  control,  safety,  comfort  or  operating  costs,  to  develop  smart  facilities.  their  solution  overcomes  some  drawbacks  of  existing  designs  such  as  interoperability  and  scalability.  the  proposed  architecture  is  experimental  and  is  based  on  embedded  devices.  however,  iot  approaches  should  be  more  flexible  in  terms  of  integration  of  components,  in  a  similar  way  as  cafcla  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement geca  are  implemented.  in  ,  authors  present  geca,  a  global  edge  computing  architecture  which  integrates  blockchain  technologies  to  strengthen  security  on  the  three  levels  of  architecture  depicted  in  .  the  global  edge  computing  architecture  based  on  sittncandanedo  et  al.  .  the  layers  of  geca  are  described  as  follows:  :  this  layer  is  integrated  by  iot  devices  such  as  sensors,  actuators,  controllers  that  are  used  to  monitor  equipment  in  operation,  services  or  human  activities.  the  layer  uses  a  wireless  standard  such  as  wifi  or  zigbee  .  the  creators  of  geca  incorporate  blockchain  technology  and  the  concept  of  oracles  in  this  layer.
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  oracles  are  responsible  for  verifying  and  sending  data  to  the  blockchain  and  work  as  intermediaries  between  the  blockchain  and  the  devices  that  generate  data  sets  with  values  for  temperature,  humidity,  market  prices,  payments,  heart  rate,  movement,  solar  radiation  and  more.  the  generated  data  are  regulated  by  microcontrollers  with  few  computer  resources  and  reduced  storage  capacity  and  must  be  sent  to  the  edge  layer,  which  has  computing  modules  with  filtering  and  preprocessing  capabilities.  thanks  to  the  cryptoiot  boards  developed  by  the  bisite  research  group  of  the  university  of  salamanca  spain,  this  layer  complements  the  security  of  the  architecture.  each  board
__label__energymonitoringmanagement is  formed  by  a  usb  module  in  host  mode  for  connection  to  micro  servers  such  as  raspberry  pi  or  neural  processing  modules,  i2c  sensors  in  plug  and  play  modes,  an  atsha204a  encryption  chip  with  sha256  technology  and  xbee  technology  to  support  different  telecommunication  standards  such  as:  zigbee,  wifi,  lora,  fm  radio,  rpma  or  bluetooth  .  thanks  to  these  dataagnostic  electronic  devices,  it  is  possible  to  implement  platforms  and  systems  in  which  the  integrity  of  the  data  collected  by  the  different  sensors  is  guaranteed  following  the  blockchained  iot  paradigm.  this  ensures  that  no  data  are  modified  by  any  other  element  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  network  or  that  spurious  data  are  injected  into  it.  in  this  way,  neither  the  origin  nor  the  value  of  the  data  can  be  repudiated  by  any  other  observer  component  of  the  data.  for  these  reasons,  it  is  possible  to  implement  smart  contracts  that  are  automatically  executed  if  the  agreed  conditions  are  met  and  in  which  the  nodes  that  sign  these  contracts  cannot  repudiate  their  compliance  .  :  this  is  the  central  layer  of  the  architecture  and  it  is  in  charge  of  the  orchestration,  monitoring  and  updating  of  the  technological  resources  needed  for  the  management  of  the  organizations  activities.  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement edge  layer  filters  and  preprocesses  the  data  generated  in  the  iot  layer  in  realtime,  sending  to  the  cloud  the  data  used  by  business  intelligence  applications.  the  elements  in  charge  of  preprocessing  are  lowcost  solutions,  such  as  microcomputers  based  on  educational  architectures  such  as  raspberry  pi  or  open  architectures  such  as  orange  pi  based  on  raspberry  pi  with  the  ability  to  work  with  linux,  with  ram  between  256  mb  and  1  gb  as  well  as  microprocessors  from  one  to  four  cores  with  1  ghz  and  the  ability  to  add  several  sd  cards  with  gb  for  storage.  likewise,  if  the  organization  requires
__label__energymonitoringmanagement greater  computing  capacity  or  online  data  availability,  this  layer  supports  edge  gateways  that  are  computers  with  greater  capacity  that  function  as  an  intersection  between  the  devices  of  the  iot  layer  and  the  cloud.  to  manage  the  data  in  these  iot  scenarios  smart  cities,  smart  energy,  industry  4.0,  etc.,  routers  with  sufficient  processing  power  are  incorporated  into  this  layer.  in  addition,  the  edge  gateways  offer  different  interfaces  for  communication  standards  and  cable  or  radio  frequency  transmission  technologies,  such  as  ethernet,  wifi,  wlan,  bluetooth,  3g  mobile  telephony,  lte,  zigbee,  zwave,  can  bus,  modbus,  bacnet  or  scada.  :  a  set  of  services  and

__label__energymonitoringmanagement propose  the  integration  of  the  design  rules  and  features  of  this  architecture  into  systems  based  on  the  cafcla  framework.  the  aim  of  this  is  to  provide  edge  node  management  and  security,  improving  energy  efficiency  in  public  buildings.  garca  et  al.  and  garca  et  al.  define  cafcla  as  a  framework  that  allows  for  developing  elearning  applications  and  systems  based  on  a  pedagogical  computer  supported  collaborative  learning  cscl  approach  as  well  as  the  ambient  intelligence  paradigm.  shows  how  the  three  layers  of  geca  can  be  implemented  into  systems  based  on  the  cafcla  framework.  cafcla  has  five  layers  that  are  described  in  depth

__label__energymonitoringmanagement system  aimed  at  optimizing  energy  efficiency  in  public  buildings.  this  serious  game  is  based  on  the  cafcla  framework.  its  participants  are  workers  who  are  rewarded  if  they  reduce  their  energy  consumption.  to  this  end,  the  system  exploits  the  context  awareness  layer  of  cafcla,  continuously  monitoring  how  people  use  energy  during  their  working  day  in  terms  of  lighting  and  heating,  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  systems.  it  monitors  the  realtime  location  of  workers,  their  activity,  as  well  as  the  existing  temperature  and  lighting  in  the  workplace  according  to  the  external  weather  conditions.  the  advantage  of  this  system  is  reduced  data  traffic  between
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  iotedge  and  cloud  layers  thanks  to  the  application  of  the  design  rules  and  features  of  the  global  edge  computing  architecture,  evaluated  in  the  next  .  to  evaluate  and  validate  the  benefits  of  including  edge  computing  in  applications  based  on  iot  and  social  computing,  we  have  conducted  a  case  study.  more  specifically,  this  case  study  examines  how  the  performance  of  the  cafcla  framework  improves  through  the  addition  of  an  edge  layer,  following  the  global  edge  computing  architecture.  the  enhanced  version  of  the  framework  has  been  tested  in  a  scenario  aimed  at  identifying  the  efficiency  of  energy  consumption  in  public  buildings
__label__energymonitoringmanagement by  means  of  social  computing  and  contextaware  technologies.  the  former  nonedge  version  of  cafcla  had  previously  been  tested  and  described  by  garca  et  al.  .  in  this  new  work,  the  independent  performance  of  the  cafcla  framework  is  assessed.  then,  the  performance  of  cafcla  is  measured  when  it  operates  under  the  design  rules  and  features  of  the  global  edge  computing  architecture.  for  this  research,  it  is  tested  and  compared  the  two  versions  of  the  system  previous  nonedge  and  new  edgebased  in  the  same  scenario  garca  et  al.  .  as  in  the  previous  work,  the  main  objective  of  the  scenario  is  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement application  of  the  iot  and  social  computing  features  of  cafcla  for  the  development  of  serious  games  that  use  contextual  information  and  encourage  a  change  in  behaviour  towards  more  efficient  energy  habits  in  public  buildings  and/or  in  the  workplace.  the  required  contextual  information  is  collected  by  means  of  iot  devices  forming  a  wireless  sensor  network  that  facilitate  the  acquisition  of  physical  quantities  associated  with  energy  consumption  e.g.,  temperature,  lightness  at  different  points,  as  well  as  information  about  the  presence  of  each  worker  throughout  the  building  i.e.,  each  workers  location  is  detected  by  means  of  a  realtime  locating  system  ,  and  focusing
__label__energymonitoringmanagement on  an  efficient  use  of  lighting,  workstations,  heating,  ventilation  and  air  conditioning  systems,  as  well  as  elevators.  furthermore,  a  virtual  organization  of  agents  voa  supports  a  serious  game  designed  to  make  users  more  aware  and  help  them  acquire  good  habits  in  a  natural  way,  encouraging  a  change  in  their  behaviour,  so  that  energy  savings  are  achieved  through  a  more  efficient  use  of  resources.  depicts  the  laboratory  of  the  bisite  research  group  university  of  salamanca,  spain  chosen  as  the  implementation  scenario.  as  can  be  seen,  there  is  a  main  workspace  88  m  ,  with  18  desktops  for  18  workers,  all  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement them  involved  in  the  experiment,  and  two  additional  meeting  rooms  12  m  each  one.  this  laboratory  is  located  on  the  2nd  floor  of  the  building.  therefore,  workers  must  access  it  walking  up  the  stairs  or  taking  an  elevator.  iot  devices  and  edge  layer  in  the  evaluation  scenario  for  energy  efficiency  in  public  buildings  based  on  garca  et  al.  .  as  described  above,  the  cafcla  framework  defines  its  layers  in  terms  of  physical,  communication,  contextual  information,  management  and  application  layers  ,  while  the  geca  architecture  is  formed  by  iot,  edge  and  business  solution  layers  ,  and  the  correspondence  between  them  is
__label__energymonitoringmanagement reflected  in  .  from  the  point  of  view  of  cafcla  layers,  the  evaluation  scenario  can  be  described  as  follows:  the  physical  layer  contains  all  the  devices  that  will  be  used  within  the  framework,  which  are  depicted  in  :  1x  wifi  access  point  to  provide  each  player  with  an  internet  connection  for  their  smartphone  or  laptop.  some  heterogeneous  wireless  sensor  networks  that  gather  the  required  contextual  information:  ambient  temperature,  lights  switch  on/off,  brightness,  energy  consumption  at  each  workstation,  as  well  as  location  beacons  to  track  workers  throughout  the  environment:  4x  ncore  sirius  radion  devices  with  ncore  sirius  ione  expansion  boards  labeled

__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  the  participants.  the  contextual  information  layer  integrates  the  location  engine  and  all  the  logic  needed  to  perform  effective  data  collection  through  the  iot  devices  forming  the  physical  layer.  furthermore,  in  this  scenario,  this  layer  exploits  the  features  of  the  ncore  platform  and  the  ncore  polaris  realtime  locating  system  to  provide  the  system  with  sensing  and  locating  capabilities.  the  management  layer  includes  a  social  machine,  as  well  as  all  the  logic  and  intelligence  that  allows  for  the  management  of  the  serious  game.  finally,  the  application  layer  develops  the  interaction  interface  for  both  game  configuration  and  development.  thanks  to  the  use
__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  social  computing  ,  the  serious  game  provides  the  players  with  recommendations  in  the  form  of  daily  emails  based  on  the  most  energyefficient  actions  that  have  been  taken  by  other  workers.  the  nearest  knextneighbor  algorithm  knnknearest  neighbors  is  used  to  determine  different  groups  of  workers,  according  to  how  each  worker  uses  the  lights,  stairs/elevator,  hvac  systems  or  the  amount  of  energy  they  consume  at  their  workstation.  if  the  worker  completes  a  recommended  action,  they  win  10  virtual  coins,  otherwise  they  are  penalized  and  10  virtual  coins  are  taken  away  from  them.  to  encourage  participants,  once  they  have  collected  250  virtual
__label__energymonitoringmanagement coins,  they  can  exchange  them  for  something  from  the  vending  machine  of  the  building.  the  actions  that  help  to  win  or  lose  virtual  coins  are  as  follows:  avoid  switching  on  lamps  when  natural  lighting  is  above  200  lx  i.e.,  lumen/m  .  do  not  use  the  air  conditioning  system  when  the  temperature  is  above  18  c  in  winter  or  under  25  c  in  summer.  obtain  a  daily  power  consumption  below  the  average  of  the  previous  day.  use  the  stairs  instead  of  the  elevator.  turn  off  the  lights  and  the  air  conditioning  system  when  the  last  user  leaves  the  lab.  belong  to
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  group  whose  behaviour  is  efficient  over  a  twoday  period.  garca  et  al.  concluded  that  gaming  was  a  powerful  tool  for  promoting  energysaving  habits  and  also  healthy  behaviors,  by  means  of  encouraging  workers  to  achieve  higher  scores  during  the  performance  of  the  game.  nonetheless,  the  objective  of  this  new  research  is  different.  in  this  sense,  presents  the  dataflow  chart  of  the  evaluation  scenario,  in  which  a  new  version  of  the  system  based  on  the  cafcla  framework  would  benefit  from  the  application  of  the  geca  architecture  design  guidelines.  the  benefits,  thanks  to  the  inclusion  of  the  edge  layer,  include  achieving  reduced

__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  amount  of  incoming  and  outgoing  traffic,  among  others.  the  application  of  the  edge  computing  paradigm  can  reduce  the  traffic  that  moves  into  and  out  of  the  cloud  and  the  amount  of  data  that  the  cloud  stores,  and  the  computing  resources  used  up.  to  test  and  validate  the  benefits  of  using  an  edge  computing  architecture  in  the  cafcla  framework  i.e.,  the  global  edge  computing  architecture  that  the  platform  follows  in  terms  of  savings  in  incoming  from  iot  devices  or  edge  nodes  to  cloud  and  outgoing  from  cloud  to  the  iot  devices  or  edge  nodes  transmission  costs,  the  platform  was  evaluated
__label__energymonitoringmanagement in  the  same  use  case  in  the  bisite  research  group  environment  in  a  two  fourweek  28  calendar  days  each  one  period.  these  two  tests  were  carried  out  in  separate  time  periods.  the  first  test  was  carried  out  from  3  september  2018  to  30  september  2018,  both  days  included,  and  the  second  test  was  performed  from  1  october  2018  to  28  october  2018,  both  days  included.  therefore,  the  same  number  of  working  days  and  weekends  were  considered  within  the  two  tests.  the  first  test  was  used  as  a  baseline  period  with  no  edge  layer  present,  just  iot  layer  iot  devices  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement iotcloud  gateway  and  business  solution  layer  in  the  cloud.  the  second  one  was  used  to  verify  the  possibility  of  optimizing  the  performance  of  the  same  system  through  the  addition  of  the  edge  layer  by  means  of  the  full  application  of  the  global  edge  computing  architecture,  that  is,  with  iot  layer,  edge  layer  and  business  solution  layer  on  cloud  present  and  running  within  the  platform.  the  two  tests  were  subjected  to  exactly  the  same  conditions  in  terms  of  iot  data  sources.  in  the  first  test,  we  measured  the  amount  of  data  transferred  in  the  old  version  of  the  system  between  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement iot  sensors  and  the  cloud,  both  uplink  traffic  from  the  iot  devices  to  the  cloud  and  the  downlink  traffic  from  the  cloud  to  the  iot  devices.  this  version  did  not  benefit  from  the  advantages  provided  by  the  edge  layer  of  the  global  edge  computing  architecture.  in  the  second  test,  the  same  experiment  was  carried  out  to  evaluate  the  new  version  of  the  cafclabased  energy  efficiency  system,  which  included  the  new  edge  layer  of  geca.  in  this  research,  the  new  cryptoiot  boards  were  not  included  in  order  to  start  the  second  test  as  soon  as  possible.  starting  the  test  later  would
__label__energymonitoringmanagement imply  greater  variations  in  daily  sun  hours  and  weather  conditions  and  thus  the  inability  to  compare  the  results  accurately.  otherwise,  the  use  of  lighting  and  hvac  by  workers  would  be  probably  quite  different  in  the  second  test  with  respect  to  the  first  test  considered  as  baseline.  therefore,  in  the  second  test  data,  transmission  was  measured  in  two  links:  uplink  and  downlink  traffic  between  the  iot  sensors  and  the  edge  layer  from  iot  devices  to  edge  nodes,  and  from  edge  nodes  to  iot  devices,  respectively  and  uplink  and  downlink  traffic  between  the  edge  layer  and  the  cloud  from  the  edge  nodes
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  the  cloud,  and  from  the  cloud  to  the  edge  nodes,  respectively.  as  mentioned  previously,  the  system  deployed  in  the  first  test  was  a  nonedge  version;  it  did  not  include  the  edge  elements  based  on  the  raspberry  pi  3  model  b  and  tensorflowlite  or  blockchain.  in  this  sense,  in  the  first  test,  the  iotcloud  gateways  gathered  the  data  through  zigbee  and  wifi  and  forwarded  them  directly  to  the  cloud  by  means  of  a  fiber  optics  internet  connection  without  filtering,  preprocessing,  or  encrypting  them.  on  the  contrary,  in  the  second  test,  the  new  edge  elements  based  on  the  raspberry  pi  3
__label__energymonitoringmanagement model  b  and  tensorflowlite  were  incorporated,  thus  following  the  full  features  and  design  rules  of  the  global  edge  computing  architecture.  in  both  tests,  the  number  of  iot  data  sources  and  the  number  of  players  were  the  same.  the  business  solution  layer  of  the  energy  efficiency  system  was  deployed  in  google  cloud  using  the  app  engine  as  paas  platform  as  a  service  to  provide  the  backend  of  the  system,  including  the  realtime  locating  system  developed  under  .net  core,  the  google  cloud  sql  to  provide  the  relational  database  configuration,  users,  node  setup,  etc.,  google  functions  as  faas  function  as  a  service  developed
__label__energymonitoringmanagement under  node.js  to  provide  the  different  rest  apis  of  the  system  and  google  bigquery  to  provide  database  for  storing  massive  volumes  of  sensing  data  coming  from  iot  and  edge  layers.  furthermore,  to  develop  the  frontend,  html5,  bootstrap  4  and  vue.js  technologies  were  utilized.  on  the  one  hand,  shows  a  graphical  comparison  between  the  uplink  traffic  from  iot  devices  to  edge  nodes,  from  iot  devices  to  cloud  and  from  edge  nodes  to  cloud  in  the  two  fourweek  tests,  nonedge  and  edgebased,  respectively.  on  the  other  hand,  depicts  the  same  comparison  between  the  downlink  traffic  from  edge  nodes  to  iot  devices,  from
__label__energymonitoringmanagement cloud  to  iot  nodes  and  from  cloud  to  edge  nodes  in  the  two  tests.  comparison  of  the  amount  of  data  transferred  in  the  two  tests  uplink.  comparison  of  the  amount  of  data  transferred  in  the  two  tests  downlink.  logically,  in  stage  1  nonedge,  there  is  only  a  single  direct  bidirectional  data  flow  between  the  iot  devices  and  the  cloud,  since  no  edge  device  is  implemented  at  that  stage.  on  the  other  hand,  in  stage  2  edgebased,  in  which  edge  devices  are  incorporated,  there  is  no  direct  communication  between  iot  devices  and  the  cloud,  but  there  are  two  bidirectional  flows:  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement first  between  iot  devices  and  the  edge  nodes,  and  the  second  between  the  edge  nodes  and  the  cloud.  finally,  shows  the  total  amount  of  data  transferred  uplink  and  downlink  during  the  two  fourweek  tests.  the  data  in  the  table  demonstrates  that  the  application  of  the  global  edge  reference  architecture  to  the  social  computing  energy  efficiency  system  has  been  beneficial.  it  allowed  for  reducing  the  amount  of  total  data  transferred  to  the  cloud,  thanks  to  the  inclusion  of  the  edge  layer.  these  results  show  that  the  geca  architecture  has  contributed  considerably  to  our  system,  given  that  the  same  conditions  had  been
__label__energymonitoringmanagement established  in  the  public  building  scenario  and  the  level  of  sensitization  was  the  same,  56.71  58.47  in  uplink  and  36.00  in  downlink.  data  transmitted  between  the  different  iot,  edge  and  cloud  components  in  the  two  fourweektests.  in  the  usual  cost  scheme  of  cloud  providers,  the  storage  and  ingestion  of  data  tends  to  have  a  reduced  price,  while  the  costs  are  higher  both  in  the  computation  that  is  done  on  the  data  or  the  actual  extraction  of  data  out  of  the  cloud  again  .  although  the  reduction  in  traffic  is  more  significant  in  data  uploading  to  the  cloud  than  in  data
__label__energymonitoringmanagement downloading,  reducing  the  traffic  uploading  to  the  cloud  allows  for  reducing  the  computing  costs  associated  with  the  processing  of  such  data.  in  this  sense,  thanks  to  the  use  of  the  geca  architecture  in  the  new  version  of  the  platform  for  the  implementation  of  the  system,  the  reduction  in  the  volume  of  data  transferred  to  the  necessary  cloud  is  much  lower  than  in  the  first  version  of  the  system.  this  reduction  could  be  different  in  other  scenarios  that  would  make  possible  the  use  of  different  filtering  and  preprocessing  at  the  edge  layer,  such  as  smart  farming  scenarios  as  introduced  by  sittncandanedo
__label__energymonitoringmanagement et  al.  .  in  the  scenario  analyzed  in  this  paper,  the  energy  consumption  reduction  is  much  more  significant  than  in  sittncandanedo  et  al.  .  this  is  because  in  this  case  an  indoor  location  system  has  been  introduced;  it  sends  much  more  data  from  the  beacons  of  the  realtime  locating  system  running  in  the  cloud.  in  this  sense,  the  edge  layer  is  used  in  the  raspberry  pi  3  model  b,  as  an  edge  gateway  for  filtering  the  duplicated  frames  coming  from  the  zigbee  beacons  through  the  collector  node,  so  that  the  reduction  of  traffic  that  is  uploaded  to  the  cloud  is
__label__energymonitoringmanagement very  noticeable.  however,  the  reduction  in  traffic  between  the  edge  and  the  cloud  could  be  even  greater  if  the  location  engine  were  also  implemented  on  the  edge,  something  that  has  not  been  done  at  this  stage.  although  the  raspberry  pi  3  model  b  is  capable  of  running  complex  algorithms  with  a  certain  level  of  efficiency,  it  is  necessary  to  adapt  and  optimize  the  ncore  locating  engine  so  that  its  performance  is  adequate  in  microcomputers  such  as  the  raspberry  pi  3  model  b.  nowadays,  there  are  more  and  more  applications  in  which  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  detailed  information  on  different
__label__energymonitoringmanagement environmental  and  operational  variables  involved  in  a  given  environment.  in  this  sense,  technologies  such  as  the  internet  of  things,  massive  data  repositories  big  data  and  data  analysis  techniques  business  intelligence,  machine  learning  are  presented  as  ideal  tools  for  monitoring  these  variables,  as  well  as  the  extraction  of  knowledge  from  them.  one  of  the  application  areas  where  these  technologies  can  have  a  greater  impact  are  smart  energy  and,  more  specifically,  the  reduction  of  energy  consumption  in  public  buildings.  in  this  type  of  scenario,  cloud  computing  technology  makes  it  possible  to  always  have  uptodate  computer  equipment  and  consume  less  energy  as  physical
__label__energymonitoringmanagement resources  are  being  shared  among  many  users  by  virtual  machines.  however,  cloud  service  providers  charge  for  computing,  storage,  and  network  traffic  services  based  on  their  use.  the  results  of  this  work  demonstrate  that  it  is  possible  to  deploy  systems  that  are  more  economic  in  terms  of  cloud  provider  costs,  by  balancing  the  computation  load  from  the  cloud  to  the  edge  through  devices  with  reduced  computational  capacities,  consumption  and  hardware  cost.  these  systems  reduce  costs  because  they  do  not  transfer  unnecessary  information  to  the  cloud.  this  also  means  that  computational  and  storage  costs  in  the  cloud  are  lower.  in  conclusion,  this
__label__energymonitoringmanagement work  has  demonstrated  the  benefits  of  applying  the  design  rules  and  the  functionalities  of  the  global  edge  computing  architecture  to  the  cafcla  framework,  especially  in  scenarios  that  involve  the  use  of  iot  and  social  computing  technologies  for  greater  energy  efficiency.  this  has  been  the  case  with  this  new  proposal,  where  an  existing  energy  efficiency  system  has  been  improved  notably  with  the  application  of  cafcla  and  geca,  reducing  the  data  traffic  that  enters  the  cloud,  especially  lessening  the  amount  of  information  that  needs  to  be  transmitted  from  the  zigbee  beacons  to  the  locating  engine  running  in  the  cloud.  the  inclusion  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  new  edge  hardware  based  on  lowcost  raspberry  pi  3  model  b  devices  makes  sense  to  reduce  the  recurrent  cloud  provider  costs  in  terms  of  cloud  computing,  storage  and  network  resources.  moreover,  the  edge  layer  allows  for  continuing  to  provide  users  with  data  analytics  and  not  lose  data  if  the  communication  with  the  cloud  is  temporally  interrupted.  furthermore,  with  this  first  step,  we  have  set  the  basis  for  a  further  research  on  testing  how  this  new  edge  layer  can  provide  new  features  such  as  machine  learning  techniques  at  the  edge  similarly  to  the  rtls  engine.  however,  we  hypothesize  that  there
__label__energymonitoringmanagement is  still  a  lot  of  room  for  improvement  in  the  reduction  of  traffic  that  enters  the  cloud  from  the  edge.  this  would  be  possible  if  a  part  of  the  engine  were  deployed  to  calculate  the  positions  of  users  in  the  edge  itself.  in  this  regard,  a  future  work  will  consider  deploying  a  part  of  the  components  of  the  locating  engine  in  the  edge  layer  instead  of  the  business  solution  layer.  once  this  development  has  been  completed,  new  tests  will  be  carried  out  in  the  same  scenario  to  compare  the  potential  improvement.  furthermore,  new  experiments  will  include  a  comparison  not  only

__label__energymonitoringmanagement keeping  assets  up  and  running  has  the  potential  to  significantly  decrease  operational  expenditures,  saving  companies  millions  of  dollars.  with  the  use  of  sensors,  cameras  and  data  analytics,  managers  in  a  range  of  industries  are  able  to  determine  when  a  piece  of  equipment  will  fail  before  it  does.  these  iotenabled  systems  can  sense  warning  signs,  use  data  to  create  maintenance  timelines  and  preemptively  service  equipment  before  problems  occur.  by  leveraging  streaming  data  from  sensors  and  devices  to  quickly  assess  current  conditions,  recognize  warning  signs,  deliver  alerts  and  automatically  trigger  appropriate  maintenance  processes,  iot  turns  maintenance  into  a  dynamic,  rapid  and  automated
__label__energymonitoringmanagement task.  this  approach  promises  cost  savings  over  routine  or  timebased  preventive  maintenance,  because  tasks  are  performed  only  when  they  are  needed.  the  key  is  to  get  the  right  information  at  the  right  time.  this  will  allow  managers  to  know  which  equipment  needs  maintenance;  maintenance  work  can  be  better  planned;  and  systems  remain  online  while  workers  stay  on  task.  other  potential  advantages  include  increased  equipment  lifetime,  increased  plant  safety  and  fewer  accidents  with  negative  environmental  impact.  a  smart  meter  is  an  internetcapable  device  that  measures  energy,  water  or  natural  gas  consumption  of  a  building  or  home,  .  traditional  meters  only  measure

__label__energymonitoringmanagement is  the  .  while  the  cloud  wont  deliver  the  power  itself,  there  are  several  different  technologies  currently  on  the  market  that  can  reinforce  the  grid  and  improve  smart  buildings.  thats  where  iot  comes  in.  the  internet  of  things,  or  iot,  is  a  broad  term  that  defines  anything  connected  as  part  of  a  network,  capable  of  both  sending  and  receiving  data.  the  majority  of  this  network  is  based  on  sensors,  and  its  these  devices  that  will  power  energyasaservice.  current  energy  production  focuses  on  a  centralized  grid  and  while  it  has  served  us  well  in  the  past,  decentralized  microgrids  are  emerging  ,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement monitor  energy  usage  and  even  transition  into  green  energy.  all  of  these  transitions  rely  on  iot.  networked  sensors  can  provide  information  about  power  failures  or  system  problems  in  real  time.  microgrids,  or  small  selfsufficient  systems,  are  already  in  use  in  remote  areas  and  island  nations  where  centralized  grids  are  not  practical  or  efficient.  how  can  iot  help  smart  buildings  moving  forward?  the  trend  toward  smart  cities  and  microgrids  isnt  only  based  in  practicality  it  fuels  the  growing  green  movement  as  a  way  to  make  our  towns  and  buildings  more  energy  efficient.  by  implementing  iot  and  power  as  a  service,  city
__label__energymonitoringmanagement planners  and  engineers  create  the  foundation  for  these  new  technologies  to  deploy  on  a  full  scale.  smart  lighting,  for  example,  doesnt  only  mean  replacing  your  traditional  fluorescent  lights  with  leds,  though  thats  one  of  the  first  steps  and  leds  do  use  than  incandescent  bulbs.  iot  enabled  smart  lighting  use  sensors  placed  throughout  the  building  to  monitor  energy  usage,  and  even  photosensitive  sensors  to  control  the  amount  of  light  coming  in  from  the  windows.  with  this  information,  the  system  can  automatically  adjust  the  brightness  of  the  interior  lights.  by  connecting  this  system  to  the  internet,  it  can  check  the  weather  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement modify  the  lighting  based  on  the  weather  reports  youll  need  more  artificial  light  if  its  foggy  or  rainy  outside,  for  example.  power  outages  arent  just  inconvenient  they  can  be  dangerous  for  atrisk  individuals  like  the  disabled  or  elderly.  during  the  power  outages  after  hurricane  irma  hit  florida  in  2017,  because  of  the  florida  heat.  much  of  the  state  relied  on  centralized  grids  and  were  without  power  for  days  or  weeks  while  the  utility  companies  scrambled  to  repair  the  storm  damage.  iotpowered  microgrids  could  prevent  these  tragedies,  even  if  they  dont  generate  enough  energy  to  power  an  entire  town.  instead  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement trying  to  rely  on  gasoline  or  diesel  generators,  a  town  can  use  solar  power,  battery  banks  and  other  alternative  energy  sources  to  power  important  buildings  hospitals,  nursing  homes,  grocery  stores,  etc.  until  power  is  restored.  iot  is  integral  to  microgrids,  giving  these  systems  the  ability  to  run  autonomously,  transferring  power  from  the  stores  automatically  if  the  centralized  grid  fails  for  whatever  reason.  with  proper  programming,  they  can  regulate  the  energy  drawn  by  each  building  or  shut  it  off  entirely  when  its  not  in  use  all  without  the  need  for  human  intervention.  weve  lived  in  the  internet  age  for  decades  now,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement and  we  incorporate  these  devices  into  our  lives  daily.  our  technology  has  finally  caught  up  to  our  imagination,  giving  us  the  tools  to  start  integrating  iot  into  our  utilities  and  infrastructure.  earlier,  we  looked  at  the  connection  between  sensors  and  microgrids  and  how  both  could  spur  a  move  away  from  the  traditional  centralized  grid  system.  one  company  thats  already  moving  forward  with  this  is  .  it  offers  plugandplay  artificial  intelligence  software  that  gives  utility  operators  the  insights  they  need  to  optimize  decentralized  grids  or  help  customers  make  smarter  energy  usage  choices.  then,  they  can  avoid  problems  that  might  leave  people

__label__energymonitoringmanagement uses  of  iot  in  manufacturing  settings  include  sensors  for  alerting  to  problems  on  the  production  line,  tracking  of  assets  in  the  production  process,  and  extracting  data  about  the  time  and  quantity  of  items  dispensed  by  machines  in  the  plant.  the  iot  has  the  potential  to  dramatically  increase  the  availability  of  information,  and  is  likely  to  transform  companies  and  organizations  in  virtually  every  industry  around  the  world,  writes  ul  in  its  as  such,  finding  ways  to  leverage  the  power  of  the  iot  is  expected  to  factor  into  the  strategic  objectives  of  most  technology  companies,  regardless  of  their  industry  focus.  the  internet
__label__energymonitoringmanagement building  management  for  multifacility  businesses  is  a  daunting  task,  one  that  often  takes  a  team  of  managers  and  employees  to  coordinate  and  maintain,  especially  across  multiple  locations.  the  use  of  technology  such  as  has  made  it  possible  to  simplify  the  process  through  enhanced  visibility,  shared  analytics,  and  improved  coordination  and  communications.  emerging  technologies  such  as  the  are  also  making  it  easier  to  track  the  state  of  buildings  and  critical  infrastructure  by  using  sensors  and  remote  management  dashboards  to  optimize  energy  use,  utility  costs,  and  facility  occupancy.  such  optimization  can  reduce  human  error,  saving  even  more  costs  through  improved  tracking  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement energy  consumption.  in  fact,  microsoft  announced  in  2018  that  it  was  investing  in  the  iot  sector  over  the  next  four  years  to  enable  its  customers  to  transform  their  businesses  with  connected  solutions.  by  2024,  almost  1  billion  sensors  will  be  installed  in  us  offices  and  stores  to  enable  widescale  operational  efficiencies.  besides  making  building  management  easier  for  employees,  selfmonitoring  energyrelated  equipment  can  also  help  ,  which  is  more  sustainable  for  the  environment  and  the  buildings  longterm  impact  on  resources.  there  are  several  ways  to  optimize  building  energy  use  through  iot  technology.  lets  dive  in:  without  realtime  monitoring,  its  difficult  to
__label__energymonitoringmanagement understand  just  how  much  energy  is  used  in  a  facility.  iot  sensors  are  added  to  existing  meters  to  monitor  usage  from  a  separate  online  dashboard,  one  thats  accessible  by  mobile  phone  or  computer.  using  this  technology  allows  building  managers  to  analyze  energy  spend  and  find  areas  for  savings.  for  instance,  this  technology  will  track  energy  usage  like  heating  and  lighting  and  foot  traffic  throughout  the  day  to  determine  both  busy  periods  and  when  buildings  are  unoccupied.  over  time,  the  data  generates  insights  that  enable  iotconnected  equipment  to  intelligently  turn  lights  off  and  lower  thermostats  to  reduce  energy  use  when  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement building  is  mostly  empty  or  vacant.  this  will  dramatically  increase  your  buildings  efficiency.  certain  facilities  also  have  a  need  for  air  quality  monitoring,  especially  co2  and  oxygen  levels.  making  sure  that  air  quality  falls  between  an  adequate  range  ensures  employee  safety  and  may  also  be  important  for  certain  machines,  processes,  or  types  of  products.  air  quality  is  also  something  that  affects  the  environment  and  the  surrounding  community  of  a  facility.  you  can  measure  outdoor  air  quality  levels  to  track  elements  like  external  carbon  monoxide  output,  nitrogen  dioxide,  and  particulate  matter.  this  way,  companies  ensure  that  their  processes  or  manufacturing  facilities
__label__energymonitoringmanagement arent  polluting  the  surrounding  area.  it  also  gives  them  a  record  of  data  to  analyze,  should  environmental  concerns  come  up  internally  or  from  the  community  and  local  government.  the  larger  the  facility  is,  the  higher  the  likelihood  that  it  isnt  efficient.  iot  technology  can  track  doors,  entrances,  offices,  and  other  areas  in  a  building  to  ensure  effective  utilization  of  space.  it  can  also  give  employees  an  idea  of  most  used  building  times,  thus  optimizing  of  energy  and  utility  use.  in  addition,  by  tracking  space  utilization  you  can  better  understand  when  its  time  to  expand  or  decrease  facility  size.  a  high
__label__energymonitoringmanagement space  occupancy  may  signal  to  the  team  that  its  time  to  expand  into  a  bigger  building.  conversely,  if  large  areas,  offices,  or  warehouse  spaces  of  a  building  arent  used,  the  company  should  look  into  moving  into  a  smaller  office  or  lease  the  unused  space  to  another  company  to  make  up  building  expenses.  many  facilities  have  multiple  utility  control  panels  to  control  air  conditioning,  heating,  and  building  lights.  with  iot  technology,  companies  can  automate  utility  control  based  on  temperature,  occupancy,  or  time  of  day.  some  technology  also  has  the  capability  to  uncover  trends  in  utility  data,  so  facility  managers  can  make
__label__energymonitoringmanagement more  informed  decisions  about  how  and  when  utilities  are  used.  for  example,  if  the  data  shows  that  the  building  doesnt  get  up  to  70  degrees  internally  until  the  outdoor  temperature  reaches  85,  facility  managers  know  to  not  turn  on  the  air  conditioning  until  the  outdoor  temperature  threshold  is  reached.  this  saves  more  energy  and  costs  than  simply  turning  on  the  air  conditioning  because  it  has  been  getting  warmer  outside.  another  application  is  with  lighting.  many  smart  buildings  implement  lighting  that  automatically  turns  off  if  no  one  is  in  the  room  or  hallway.  this  goes  a  long  way  in  cutting  energy
__label__energymonitoringmanagement consumption  and  electricity  costs.  another  key  benefit  of  iotconnected  devices  is  .  finding  machine  issues  or  process  problems  through  human  discovery  often  means  that  the  problem  isnt  discovered  until  major  damage  or  mistakes  have  occurred  with  the  machinery  or  the  facility  process.  iot  systems  at  the  edge  with  a  service  automation  platform  in  the  cloud  help  facility  teams  accelerate  response  times  and  leverage  data  and  analytics  better.  this  way,  the  iotcollected  data  triggers  work  orders  and  schedule  technician  visits  when  abnormal  results  are  detected  and  ideally  before  a  critical  failure  occurs.  along  that  vein,  iot  can  also  help  prevent  equipment
__label__energymonitoringmanagement malfunctions  before  they  happen.  with  iotconnected  equipment,  facility  managers  are  alerted  if  something  is  awry  or,  perhaps,  if  a  warranty  is  close  to  expiration.  being  proactive  with  regular  maintenance  and  fixing  less  critical  errors  before  they  turn  into  total  failures  ensures  the  building  continues  to  run  smoothly.  take  locks  as  an  example.  if  an  automatic  door  lock  begins  to  stick  and  stop  working,  iot  detects  this  minor  mechanical  defect  and  facility  manager  easily  fixes  it  with  some  lubrication  oil.  however,  if  the  door  lock  error  isnt  detected  by  technology,  it  turns  into  a  major  .  simply  put,  this  technology  detects
__label__energymonitoringmanagement issues  before  a  building  manager  even  sees  them.  major  insurance  company  munich  re  is  capitalizing  on  the  benefits  of  iot  they  acquired  a  small  iot  software  startup  that  connects  to  new  and  legacy  hardware  assets  and  software  to  extract  and  analyze  data  from  physical  objects,  like  machines  and  equipment.  all  of  this  makes  it  possible  for  their  clients  restaurants,  retailers,  etc.  to  determine  when  a  piece  of  equipment  is  likely  to  fail.  by  prioritizing  optimized  energy  consumption  through  iot  technology,  facility  managers  can  cut  utility  costs,  decrease  excess  energy  usage,  and  reduce  human  error.  ultimately,  this  leads  to  a  more
__label__energymonitoringmanagement modern  buildings  are  no  longer  static  objects  made  up  of  walls  and  windows  with  some  thermal  and  lighting  control.  rapid  advances  in  technology  and  the  incorporation  of  internet  of  things  iot  style  systems  are  causing  buildings  to  evolve  into  dynamic  environments  capable  of  selfcorrection  and  multitarget  optimization  that  are  undeniably  smart.  the  term  can  be  used  to  describe  any  building  that  makes  use  of  some  kind  of  automation  in  its  operation  and  control.  the  degree  of  automation  and  use  of  intelligent  technology  can  range  from  something  as  simple  as  a  building  with  a  timercontrolled  heating,  ventilation  and  airconditioning  hvac  system,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  a  building  which  continuously  adjusts  hvac  operation  based  on  measured  interior  conditions  and  occupancy  information  to  optimize  energy  consumption.  much  of  the  thinking  behind  smart  buildings  is  based  on  optimizing  building  performance  with  the  goal  of  reducing  energy  consumption  and  the  associated  costs.  hvac  system  and  lighting  automation  are  therefore  common  as  these  are  typically  among  the  larger  consumers  of  energy  in  a  building.  automation  can,  and  is,  however  be  applied  to  almost  all  building  systems  including,  for  example,  sanitation,  safety  and  security  systems.  with  the  rapidly  growing  internet  of  things  iot  and  associated  and  controllers,  smarter  building  automation

__label__energymonitoringmanagement and  control.  the  benefits  of  using  this  information  to  inform  and  improve  decision  making  related  to  building  automation  are  numerous  and  powerful.  the  degree  to  which  the  potential  benefits  of  building  automation  can  be  realized  depends  on  the  quality  of  the  decisions  made  relating  to  the  automation  of  the  building  operation.  the  quality  of  this  decision  making  process  can  be  dramatically  improved  if  the  behavior  of  the  building  and  the  impact  of  any  changes  in  operation  are  well  understood.  iot  technology  provides  building  managers  and  other  decision  makers  with  high  resolution  information  relating  to  the  operation  and  performance  of  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement building  and  therefore  enables  this  higher  level  of  understanding  and  therefore  enhances  the  benefits  of  smart  buildings.  one  of  the  primary  benefits  of  smart  buildings  .  automation  of  a  buildings  energy  consuming  systems  allows  for  greater  control  of  how  much,  and  when,  energy  is  consumed  in  the  building.  the  potential  energy  savings  can  be  further  enhanced  with  iot  technology.  as  an  example,  consider  a  building  hvac  system.  automation  of  this  system  can  save  energy  by,  say,  only  running  the  system  during  the  hours  when  the  building  is  typically  occupied.  in  this  scenario  the  hvac  system  would  be  servicing  the  entire
__label__energymonitoringmanagement building  despite  occupants  perhaps  not  using  certain  rooms  at  any  given  time.  by  incorporating  an  iot  sensors  that  detect  occupancy  and  communicates  that  the  hvac  system  should  service  or  not  certain  rooms,  additional  energy  can  be  saved.  in  addition  to  energy  savings,  incorporating  iot  technology  into  smart  buildings  allows  for  to  be  implemented  through  measurement  of  system  performance  and  alerting  the  building  manager  when  the  system  is  observed  to  not  be  performing  as  expected.  reduced  equipment  failures  and  maintenance  outages  further  contribute  to  the  potential  cost  saving  benefits  of  smart  buildings.  include  improved  occupant  health  and  productivity  through  iot  feedback

__label__energymonitoringmanagement engine  integrates  prediction  models,  rules  and  a  mariadb  database  to  store  the  results.  the  prediction  models  are  datadriven  models  to  forecast  the  energy  behaviour  of  a  building  according  to  some  specific  indicators  e.g.,  renewable  energy  production,  energy  consumption,  indoor  temperature  and  energy  prices.  the  prediction  models  are  automatically  estimated  and  customized  per  building  given  the  measure  to  be  forecasted  and  the  data  available  e.g.,  external  variables  and  length  of  historical  data.  the  estimated  model  can  then  be  directly  used  to  predict  in  a  reliable  and  accurate  way  the  measure  across  the  upcoming  week.  different  types  of  models  timesseries,  multiple  linear
__label__energymonitoringmanagement regressionmlr,  etc.  are  considered  and  the  bestfitted  one  is  selected  and  parameterized  per  case  to  achieve  the  best  performance.  the  prediction  models  have  been  implemented  as  r  scripts  and  rapidanalytics  processes.  the  rules  implemented  as  a  symfony  php  web  application  are  expert  knowledgebased  algorithms  aimed  at  giving  suggestions  for  intelligent  energy  management.  they  consist  of  simple  logicbased  rules  most  of  them  based  on  logical  sentences  that  can  be  implemented  and  used  for  better  managing  a  building  that  is  already  equipped  with  a  network  of  sensors.  the  rules  are  divided  into  four  individual  sections,  depending  on  three  fields  of  application:  building
__label__energymonitoringmanagement management  of  occupancy,  heating  and  cooling  technical  systems,  indoor  thermal  comfort,  air  cooling  through  airside  economizer  strategies;  building  and  res  production  management  of  the  generation  and  onsite  res  production  and  exploitation;  building,  res  production  and  storage  management  the  operation  of  different  energy  flows  towards  energy  cost  reduction.  each  rule  or  a  combination  of  them  generates  an  action  plan  that  is  the  suggestion  for  better  managing  the  building  with  the  purpose  of  decreasing  its  energy  consumption.  a  webbased  system  was  implemented,  integrating  the  abovementioned  architecture.  an  important  function  of  the  tool  is  the  immediate  and  complete  virtual  distribution  on  the  internet
__label__energymonitoringmanagement of  the  energy  consumption  in  buildings.  thus,  the  user  can  be  constantly  updated  on  the  energy  consumption  and  other  indicators  energy  cost,  co  emissions,  etc.  wherever  located,  always  with  the  ease  of  use  of  the  website.  on  the  first  level,  the  proposed  system  collects,  analyses  and  presents  data  amongst  four  major  groups  of  indicators,  facilitating  the  energy  management  .  indicators.  the  first  group  consists  of  five  indicators  and  focuses  on  the  buildings  energy  consumption,  either  electricity  or  fossil  fuels,  which  is  directly  compared  with  the  buildings  surface.  it  includes  both  data  from  realized  consumptions  and  projections  for  future  ones  i
__label__energymonitoringmanagement ,  i  ,  i  .  the  other  two  indicators  that  constitute  the  consumption  group  are  a  little  bit  more  detailed  i  ,  i  .  this  group  of  indicators  provides  valuable  information  to  the  users  groups,  both  for  monitoring  and  taking  action  plans.  the  second  group  of  indicators  is  more  technical  and  focuses  on  the  power  efficiency,  in  order  to  address  any  malfunctions  i  ,  i  .  the  third  group  emphasizes  on  the  energy  managements  environmental  impact,  through  calculating  the  damage  that  is  done  or  is  avoided,  depending  on  the  way  that  the  consumed  energy  is  produced.  the  group  of  indicators
__label__energymonitoringmanagement varies  with  the  location  of  the  building,  as  well  as  its  features  i  ,  i  ,  i  .  the  fourth  and  last  group  of  indicators,  the  monetary  one,  deals  with  the  economic  impact.  it  uses  the  consumptions  data  and  projection  and  calculates  the  relevant  cost  i  ,  i  ,  i  .  the  values  of  indicators  are  based  on  virtual  sensors,  namely  synthetic  sensors  whose  date  is  obtained  from  existing  sensors.  for  example,  a  virtual  sensor  can  be  created  to  obtain  the  total  energy  consumption  of  a  building  per  square  meter  that  can  have  several  physical  sensors  for  monitoring  the  data
__label__energymonitoringmanagement consumptions  of  the  different  sections.  at  a  second  level,  simple  rules  can  be  applied,  giving  suggestions  for  the  improvement  of  energy  management  related  to  the  management  of  the  occupancy,  heating  and  cooling  technical  systems,  indoor  thermal  comfort,  air  cooling  through  airside  economizer  strategies,  generation  and  onsite  res  production  and  exploitation,  etc.  once  the  user  has  logged  in,  the  main  screen  provides  some  general  information  about  the  buildings  and  their  energy  performance  .  for  the  energy  consumption  monitoring  of  a  specific  category  of  assets,  we  are  allowed,  by  choosing  particular  filters,  to  export  relevant  diagrams  for  the  energy  consumption.  we  can
__label__energymonitoringmanagement choose  which  assets  we  wants  to  review,  and  as  to  what  energy  or  environmental  indicator.  energy  assets.  moreover,  the  user  can  chose  among  different  options,  such  as  action  plans,  historical  data,  weekly  report  and  user  activity  .  another  useful  feature  of  the  system  is  the  fact  that  it  provides  the  user  with  information  related  to  the  parameters  affecting  the  action  plans  and  the  buildings.  that  way,  the  user  can  conclude  whether  there  is  any  problem  with  the  sensors  and  validate  the  suggestions  provided  by  the  algorithms  of  the  system.  frontend  environments.  the  system  can  be  appropriately  customized  to  the  users
__label__energymonitoringmanagement requirements  and  building  characteristics.  all  aspects  of  the  system  are  open  sourced.  the  code  for  data  capturing  modules,  semantic  framework,  prediction  models  and  rules  are  showcased  in  a  distinct  repository  in  order  to  be  easily  reusable  .  the  general  framework  for  the  assessment  of  the  impact  is  based  on  the  comparison  of  the  energy  consumption  before  and  after  the  real  implementation  of  the  action  plans  preaction  vs.  postaction.  the  general  framework  includes  the  following  four  phases  :  preaction  phase:  the  energy  consumption  can  be  assessed  by  means  of  inverse  models  or  forward  models.  the  inverse  models  are  built  through  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement realtime  data  collection  related  both  to  climate  and  users  input  data  and  to  historical  energy  consumption  output  data.  the  forward  models  are  fed  by  data  related  to  climate,  users,  equipment,  lighting  input  data  and  by  building  features  fixed  parameters.  the  historical  energy  consumption  data  are  then  used  to  calibrate  the  model.  pre  action  tailoring  with  postaction  input  data:  in  order  to  make  the  comparison  between  preaction  and  postaction  energy  consumption  consistent,  the  models  inverse  or  forward  developed  in  the  previous  phase  need  to  be  tailored.  this  means  that  the  calibrated  models  are  tailored  considering  the  boundary  conditions  climate  and  user
__label__energymonitoringmanagement occurring  in  the  post  action  phase.  postaction  phase:  in  the  postaction  phase,  the  energy  consumption  can  be  assessed  in  two  different  ways:  modification  of  the  forward  model  through  the  application  of  the  inference  rules  when  the  implementation  of  the  action  plans  is  simulated;  energy  monitoring  when  the  action  plans  are  actually  implemented.  impact  assessment:  the  impact  of  the  action  plans  application  can  be  assessed  in  four  different  ways:  inverse  model  vs.  inverse  model;  monitoring  vs.  forward  model;  monitoring  vs.  inverse  model;  forward  model  vs.  forward  model.  the  presented  iotbased  system  was  applied  to  the  building  premises  of  the  decision  support

__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  figures  are  derived  from  the  historical  energy  data  and  the  monitored  data.  the  total  co  emissions  are  estimated  at  86  tnco  per  year  and  the  energy  cost  11,300  .  the  monitoring  vs.  forward  model  has  been  applied  for  the  impact  analysis.  in  this  case,  the  tailored  forward  model  developed  in  the  phase  pre  action  tailoring  with  postaction  input  data  is  capable  of  estimating  the  energy  consumption  according  to  different  boundary  conditions  without  considering  the  effect  of  the  action  plans.  the  resulting  simulated  energy  consumption  can  be  considered  as  a  baseline.  in  order  to  assess  the  actual  effect  of  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement action  plans  impact,  a  comparison  between  the  actual  energy  consumption  consequent  to  the  application  of  the  action  plans  and  the  output  of  the  forward  baseline  model  is  carried  out.  during  the  pilot  implementation,  the  following  action  plans  were  applied.  the  buildings  data  indoor  air  temperature  and  energy  consumption,  weather  conditions  outdoor  air  temperature,  energy  prices  and  endusers  behaviour  data  concerning  thermal  comfort  are  integrated.  the  rules  are  automatically  generated  during  the  configuration  of  the  system:  optimising  the  boost  time  of  the  heating/cooling  system  taking  into  account  the  forecasting  of  the  indoor  air  temperature  and  the  occupancy  levels  of  the  building.

__label__energymonitoringmanagement microgrids  and  iot  solutions  are  unlocking  powerful  ways  to  reduce  energy  consumption  in  buildings.  use  of  these  technologies  can  help  both  commercial  and  residential  buildings  lower  their  energy  costs  and  prevent  wasting  energy.  in  2017,  the  u.s.  energy  information  administration  eia  reported  that  39  percent  of  total  u.s.  energy  consumption  was  attributed  to  the  residential  and  commercial  building  sector,  equivalent  to  38  quadrillion  btus.  in  europe,  this  number  is  38.1  percent  according  to  eurostat.  as  one  of  the  largest  individual  consumers  of  energy,  buildings  have  significant  potential  for  the  application  of  energy  efficient  technologies.  small,  passive  measures  such  as  painting
__label__energymonitoringmanagement a  buildings  roof  white,  shading  from  the  sun  or  replacing  office  equipment  and  electrical  appliances  can  have  a  massive  effect.  a  recent  project  in  durban,  south  africa,  implemented  the  aforementioned  measures  in  two  government  buildings  and  saw  energy  savings  of  15  percent  amounting  to  400,000  kwh  and  a  340ton  reduction  of  co2  emissions  and  an  investment  payback  period  of  five  months.  these  simple  retrofits  have  incredible  potential  with  minimal  economic  ramifications.  :  percentage  of  final  energy  consumed  by  end  users  in  residential  buildings  in  selected  regions.  as  figure  1  shows,  a  primary  issue  in  residential  energy  consumption  is  space  heating
__label__energymonitoringmanagement and  cooling.  recent  studies  have  shown  that  building  cooling  and  heating  energy  demand  will  go  up  by  anywhere  from  7  percent40  percent.  the  lower  end  of  this  growth  assumes  that  all  population  growth  occurs  in  urban  areas,  whereas  the  larger  number  corresponds  to  increases  in  demand  if  population  growth  is  strictly  suburban  or  rural  and  therefore  predominantly  housed  in  singlefamily  homes.  urban  areas  benefit  from  the  existence  of  passive  factors  such  as  smaller  fac  floor  area  per  capita  which  result  in  more  efficient  heating  and  cooling  as  well  as  lower  heat  loss  due  to  a  smaller  surface  to  volume  ratio.
__label__energymonitoringmanagement active  technologies,  such  as  district  heating,  which  would  centralize  heat  generation  across  multiple  buildings  could  also  layer  on  further  efficiencies.  urban  living,  however,  isnt  without  its  energy  tradeoffsdecreased  access  to  solar  power,  natural  ventilation  and  obstruction  by  other  buildings  make  many  passive  design  techniques  difficult  to  implement,  but  a  diverse  urban  fabric  would  ameliorate  the  prevalence  of  those  problems  and  provide  more  building  level  access  to  energyefficient  technologies.  the  growth  in  energy  demand  will  be  dominated  by  new  building  stock  in  developing  countries  and  retrofits  in  established  countries.  developing  countries  should  focus  on  passive  approaches  such  as  densification  tactics  to
__label__energymonitoringmanagement maximize  the  scalable  energy  benefits  of  urban  living,  whereas  developed  nations  should  turn  towards  active  technology  development  for  retrofits.  in  north  america  and  europe,  over  50  percent  of  all  actively  used  buildings  will  be  retrofitted  or  replaced  in  the  period  from  20102050.  while  retrofitting  is  a  great  option,  current  technologies  can  already  lead  to  a  2040  percent  reduction  in  energy  use,  but  deep  retrofit  technologies  that  are  still  under  development  might  lead  to  a  90  percent  reduction  in  energy  use.  this  creates  a  premature  lockdown  of  investment,  potentially  disincentivizing  investment  in  retrofits.  both  building  owners  trying  to  increase  their  bottom
__label__energymonitoringmanagement line  and  lawmakers  enacting  subsidies  should  to  determine  when  current  action  outweighs  potential  future  technological  gain  and  incentivizes  the  transformation  of  current  building  stock  towards  higher  energy  efficiency.  while  investment  in  individual  buildings  can  add  up  to  significant  energy  efficiency  gains  within  an  urban  area,  a  focus  on  infrastructure  allows  for  more  direct  global  impact  and  sets  the  tone  for  private  building  owners  to  innovate  in  order  to  take  advantage  of  a  more  flexible  energy  system.  two  active  infrastructural  technologies  are  microgrids  and  the  internet  of  things  iot.  microgrids  are  a  group  of  interconnected  loads  and  distributed  energy  resources  within
__label__energymonitoringmanagement clearly  defined  electrical  boundaries  that  act  as  a  single  controllable  entity  with  respect  to  the  grid.  a  microgrid  can  connect  and  disconnect  from  the  grid  to  enable  it  to  operate  in  both  gridconnected  or  islandmode  ct  public  act  12148.  this  means  that  by  leveraging  microgrids  energy  can  be  provided  at  a  local  level  by  decentralizing  electricity  production  which  in  turn  minimizes  the  amount  of  energy  loss  in  transmission.  historically,  our  grid  has  been  powered  by  central  power  stations  that  distribute  energy  by  means  of  transmission  cables.  these  grids  lose  an  average  of  66  percent  of  electricity  during  generation  and  transmission,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement whereas  microgrids  allow  for  more  distributed  generation  and  only  lose  33  percent.  this  means  that  less  fuel  needs  to  be  burned  in  order  to  meet  energy  demand.  in  traditional  grids,  6  percent  of  the  electricity  is  lost  in  transmission.  by  distributing  production  and  placing  it  closer  to  consumption,  microgrids  may  substantially  decrease  this  loss.  the  extra  730  percent  of  energy  thats  lost  in  the  conversion  from  ac  to  dc  and  back  which  is  done  to  either  match  appliance  power  standards  or  to  more  efficiently  transmit  electricity  through  certain  environments  can  also  be  minimized  since  small  renewable  energy  systems  provide  a
__label__energymonitoringmanagement larger  variety  of  dc  sources  and  the  proximity  of  production  to  consumption  reduces  the  transmission  need  of  conversion.  additionally,  due  to  the  size  constraints  inside  urban  areas,  large  power  plants  that  burn  fossil  fuels  are  harder  to  fit  into  a  distributed  microgrid  so  theres  a  greater  economic  and  ecological  incentive  for  the  connection  of  small  renewable  power  generators  .  since  microgrids  are  connected  to  multiple  electricity  generators  with  different  energy  sources,  they  are  unlikely  to  experience  total  failure,  which  increases  the  resiliency  of  our  energy  networks.  this  redundancy  also  allows  for  smart  load  matching  instead  of  having  to  rely  on
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  exorbitant  startup  costs  associated  with  traditional  fossilfuel  based  power  plants.  the  internet  of  things  is  a  distributed  series  of  sensors  that  are  interconnected,  allowing  machines  to  talk  to  one  another  and  create  independent  action  based  on  processed  data.  connected  water,  heating,  cooling  and  electricity  systems  lead  to  massive  productivity  gains,  especially  when  attached  to  a  smart  grid  that  can  almost  instantaneously  scale  electricity  pricing  and  supply  to  meet  demand.  iot  can  be  used  across  all  urban  processes,  such  as  water  systems,  which  represent  2540  percent  of  the  total  power  usage  within  urban  areas.  a  recent  project  in  fortaleza  brazil
__label__energymonitoringmanagement focused  on  rightsizing  pumps  in  the  municipal  water  supply  and  implementing  an  automatic  control  system.  this  project  cost  the  government  1.1  million  but  led  to  savings  of  2.5  million  or  88gwh  of  electricity  over  the  first  four  years  it  was  in  operation.  additionally,  the  water  authority  was  able  to  add  88,000  new  connections  since  their  new  system  was  smart  and  therefore  scalable.  another  project  in  aarhus,  denmark  implemented  electricity  generation  in  its  wastewater  treatment  facilities.  after  installation,  .  iot  isnt  just  limited  to  large  scale  infrastructural  investments.  it  can  also  extend  to  private  homes,  where  water  heaters  that  run  when

__label__energymonitoringmanagement able  to  rapidly  act  on  any  gas  leakage  or  other  potential  health  hazards.  iot  enabled  smart  grids  allow  consumers  to  manage  their  own  personal  usage  with  greater  access  to  information,  minimizing  the  knowledge  barrier  typically  associated  with  high  or  inefficient  energy  use.  additionally,  smart  monitors  allow  for  consistent  monitoring  of  a  buildings  mechanical,  electrical  and  plumbing  mep  systems  by  way  of  a  bms  which  could  automatically  shut  down  any  service  if  a  leak  or  inefficiency  is  detected.  the  data  created  by  these  sensors  could  then  also  be  analyzed  to  provide  the  systems  designers  with  data  on  energy  use  and  inform

__label__energymonitoringmanagement firms,i  can  tell  you  firsthand  how  important  iot  is  especially  as  operational  expenses  continue  to  grow  while  budgets  shrink.  iot,  that  vast  network  of  internetconnected  things  and  people,  enables  users  to  collect  and  analyze  data  through  the  use  of  connected  devices.  this  data,  and  specifically  the  fruitful  insight  it  bears,  can  be  used  to  empower  business  owners  to  make  educated  decisions  about  everything  from  energy  procurement  to  daytoday  usage  decisions.  the  end  result  is  highly  efficient  energy  use  and  significant  cuts  to  utility  bills.  sounds  great,  doesnt  it?  there  are  a  variety  of  ways  that  iot  can  transform  the  relationship
__label__energymonitoringmanagement between  your  business  and  essential  utility  use,  but  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  lets  break  it  down  into  the  daytoday  energy  engagement,  smart  analysis  and  planning,  proactive  and  preventative  maintenance,  and  last  but  certainly  not  least,  employee  involvement  and  satisfaction.  when  we  walk  into  our  homes,  we  often  flick  the  lights  on,  turn  the  heat  or  air  up  and  go  about  our  days  with  little  thought  about  how  those  habits  translate  to  dollar  figures.  the  problem  is  that  those  innocuous  actions  often  become  victims  of  oversight.  occasionally,  lights  are  left  on  and  thermostats  are  left  to  our  maximum  comfort  temperature
__label__energymonitoringmanagement even  when  were  not  home.  unfortunately,  your  business  isnt  safe  from  those  oversights,  and  over  time,  forgetfulness  and  inefficient  energy  practices  can  come  with  hefty  price  tags.  smart  technology  can  react  to  empty  rooms,  turning  off  lights  and  turning  down  hvac  units  to  eliminate  unnecessary  usage.  similarly,  owners  and  business  managers  can  be  connected  to  their  office  wherever  they  are,  enabling  them  to  use  realtime  data  to  regain  control  of  their  utilities,  even  if  they  arent  in  the  building.  in  addition  to  reacting  to  and  meeting  the  energy  needs  of  a  facility,  iot  devices  collect  data  that  can  have  a
__label__energymonitoringmanagement significant  and  lasting  impact  on  future  usage.  perhaps  even  more  important  to  operations  is  the  fact  that  this  information  can  be  collected  at  a  granular  level,  allowing  business  owners  to  identify  potential  issues  in  specific  rooms  or  times  during  the  day.  this  information  can  then  be  used  to  make  smart  decisions  about  everything  from  the  placement  of  a  server  room  to  what  parts  of  the  building  should  be  targeted  during  renovation  efforts.  additionally,  the  data  collected  can  also  identify  issues  that  may  have  previously  gone  unnoticed.  for  example,  a  hike  in  energy  use  in  a  specific  zone  may  indicate  potential
__label__energymonitoringmanagement problems  with  heating  or  cooling  systems  or  faulty  or  poorly  performing  equipment  both  of  which  can  attribute  to  unnecessarily  high  costs.  similar  to  the  way  that  an  energy  analysis  can  provide  inside  to  potential  issues  that  may  be  overburdening  your  energy  systems,  iot  sensors  have  become  so  advanced  that  they  can  alert  business  owners  to  potential  issues  before  they  become  big  problems.  consider  a  leaky  pipe  that,  over  time,  hikes  up  water  usage  or,  even  worse,  isnt  noticed  until  costly  water  damage  occurs.  sensors  can  pick  up  on  those  issues,  offering  the  opportunity  to  address  the  issue  weeks,  if  not
__label__energymonitoringmanagement months  before  real  damage  occurs.  the  same  opportunity  exists  within  machinery,  where  sensors  can  identify  changes  in  patterns,  new  vibrations  or  even  a  concerning  sound,  all  of  which  may  go  completely  unnoticed  by  the  naked  eye  or  ear.  these  issues  can  often  tax  equipment,  increasing  energy  consumption  until  the  problem  is  identified  and  resolved.  finally,  and  perhaps  most  importantly,  is  the  human  aspect.  you  may  not  be  able  to  control  the  way  employees  approach  or  manage  your  energy  conservation  initiatives,  but  a  connected  facility  can  provide  owners  with  new  and  creative  methods  of  encouragement.  since  an  office  or  warehouse  can
__label__energymonitoringmanagement be  monitored  on  a  granular  level,  employers  can  incentivize  and  reward  departments  that  do  the  most  to  decrease  their  footprint.  additionally,  the  ability  to  control  the  environment  provides  the  opportunity  for  maximum  human  comfort  without  unnecessary  cost  inflation.  and  as  anyone  who  manages  employees  knows,  a  comfortable  employee  is  a  happy  employee,  and  a  happy  employee  is  far  more  productive  than  a  hot,  cold  or  otherwise  miserable  one.  iot  is  here  to  stay,  and  whether  youre  updating  an  existing  facility  or  designing  your  new  space,  incorporating  iot  technology  can  prove  to  be  an  unavailable  method  of  controlling  your  energy  usage.

__label__energymonitoringmanagement there  is  a  huge  demand  today  for  adding  wifi  connectivity  to  iot  applications  because  of  the  many  advantages  over  other  wireless  protocols  zigbee,  bluetooth,  etc.  such  as  longer  range,  native  ip  connectivity,  and  high  bandwidth.  for  millions  of  iot  applications,  including  industrial  machines  and  sensors,  wifi  is  often  the  best  choice  for  connectivity  because  of  its  robust  infrastructure  and  global  reach  wifi  exists  almost  everywhere  in  the  world  today.  the  biggest  challenge  for  developers  has  been  the  highpower  consumption  of  wifi  in  iot  systems.  wifi  protocols  were  designed  primarily  to  optimize  bandwidth,  range,  and  throughput,  not  power  consumption.  this  makes
__label__energymonitoringmanagement it  a  poor  choice  for  powerconstrained  applications  that  rely  on  battery  power.  of  the  various  cons  of  using  standard  wifi  protocols,  high  power  consumption  is  the  most  impactful  range  limitations  and  busy  networks  are  cons  as  well.  until  today,  developers  have  avoided  adding  wifi  to  their  iot  applications  as  there  hasnt  been  a  viable  option  for  adding  wifi  connectivity  to  battery  operated  devices  that  didnt  require  high  power  consumption.  these  are  the  four  key  challenges  when  adding  wifi  connectivity:  power  consumption  in  wifi  varies  dramatically  across  various  modes  of  operation  and  its  important  to  understand  the  different  modes  and  optimize
__label__energymonitoringmanagement them  to  reduce  overall  power  consumption.  one  strategy  is  to  stay  in  the  lowest  power  mode  as  much  as  possible  and  transmit/receive  data  quickly  when  needed.  unlike  many  wireless  protocols,  wifi  power  consumption  is  significantly  impacted  by  rf  performance  and  network  conditions.  this  is  a  significant  problem  with  the  increasingly  crowded  wifi  networks  today.  a  busy  network  leads  to  many  retries/retransmissions  which  consumes  a  high  level  of  power.  developers  must  focus  on  reducing  retransmissions  and  controlling  link  budgets  to  be  successful.  wifi  devices  typically  consume  significant  power  in  both  transmit  tx  and  receive  rx  modes.  there  are  several  ways  to
__label__energymonitoringmanagement reduce  power  consumption  and  optimize  tx  and  rx  modes.  first  choose  devices  with  high  selectivity/out  of  band  rejection.  also,  choose  devices  with  high  rx  sensitivity,  and  if  possible,  choose  uncrowded  channels  for  device  operation.  this  might  mean  using  channels  not  used  by  chatty  connections  such  as  video  streaming.  power  consumption  is  highly  dependent  on  the  application  and  use  case.  iot  applications  typically  fall  into  one  of  three  categories:  always  on/connectedthese  devices  are  always  on  which  allows  users  to  access  the  device  remotely  at  any  time  via  cloud  or  mobile  application.  a  wifi  video  camera  is  a  good  example  of  this
__label__energymonitoringmanagement use  case.  latency  is  a  critical  factor  in  these  applications  and  power  consumption  is  dominated  by  the  transmit  power  mode  the  highest  power  consumption,  as  the  device  is  transmitting  data  and  it  would  be  detrimental  to  be  inactive  or  inaccessible.  these  devices  are  connected  to  a  remote  server  or  cloud  platform  and  only  need  to  transmit  occasionally.  a  good  example  is  a  temperature  or  humidity  sensor  that  sends  data  every  few  minutes  and  it  can  tolerate  the  small  amount  of  time  it  takes  to  become  active.  latency  is  not  a  major  concern  and  the  power  consumption  is  dominated  by  receive
__label__energymonitoringmanagement and  sleep  currents.  it  stays  in  intermediate  power  levels  so  its  never  completely  awake  or  asleep  so  it  wakes  up  faster.  an  online  shopping  order  button  is  a  good  example  of  eventdriven  wifi  connectivity.  its  almost  always  inactive/asleep,  meaning  there  is  no  data  transmission.  it  wakes  up  infrequently,  and  it  takes  longer  to  wake  up  from  this  mode.  an  event  occurs  that  triggers  wakeup  such  as  when  a  user  selects  the  order  button.  this  mode  is  dominated  by  the  lowest  sleep  current  and  is  best  when  needing  to  use  the  least  amount  of  power  possible  for  an  iot  application.  lowering
__label__energymonitoringmanagement wifi  power  consumption  is  also  a  design  system  issue  and  is  a  critical  challenge  for  developers  today.  power  management  and  extended  battery  life  are  major  factors  when  developing  iot  applications.  although  standard  wifi  protocols  werent  designed  initially  for  low  power  operations,  there  are  many  techniques  to  help  significantly  reduce  power  consumption.  these  techniques  include  optimizing  rx  and  tx  modes,  optimizing  powersaving  modes  sleep  modes,  wmm,  dtim,  shutdown/standby,  choosing  the  right  hardware,  using  builtin  specifications,  optimizing  rf  performance,  and  system  level  optimization.  developers  must  understand  all  the  contributing  factors  to  overall  energy  consumption  in  iot  devices.  they  must  also  understand  both
__label__energymonitoringmanagement systemlevel  factors  and  deep  application  factors  in  order  to  achieve  low  energy  consumption  in  their  applications.  finding  the  right  mix  of  powersaving  wifi  modes  and  selecting  the  right  hardware  are  the  keys  to  dramatically  reducing  power  consumption.  leveraging  hardware  and  software  designed  specifically  for  iot  devices  and  low  power  consumption  can  reduce  long  term  costs,  overcome  development  challenges,  extend  battery  life,  and  potentially  enhance  the  life  of  products  and  customer  satisfaction.  we  solve  the  power  management  issues  for  iot  developers  by  providing  dropin  ,  including  preprogrammed  modules  wf200  and  wgm160  that  can  cut  power  consumption  in  half.  these  solutions  are

__label__energymonitoringmanagement manufacturers  want  to  save  money,  conserve  energy,  and  reduce  greenhousegas  emissions,  but  its  a  challenge  to  see  where  and  when  energy  use  isoccurring.  when  the  utility  bill  arrives,  a  manufacturer  can  see  how  much  totalenergy  was  used,  but  energy  use  is  not  broken  down  on  a  machinebymachinebasis.  invisible  energy  use  hides  waste  and  makes  efficient  operationdifficult,  if  not  impossible.  the  ,  a  joint  research  initiative  of  the  university  of  california,  berkeley,  the  massachusetts  institute  of  technology,  and  the  university  of  chicago,  was  created  to  address  one  of  the  most  perplexing  energy  puzzles  of  our  time:  the  energy  efficiency  gap.  researchers
__label__energymonitoringmanagement were  interested  in  whether  manufacturers  would  become  more  efficient  at  energy  use  by  expanding  their  understanding  of  precisely  where  energy  is  being  used  in  the  manufacturing  process.  their  theory  was  that  if  companies  had  a  greater  understanding  of  how  and  where  energy  was  being  used,  they  would  be  able  to  effectively  employ  energy  conservation  measures,  thus  reducing  their  energy  use.  with  5  million  in  funding  from  california  energy  commission,  uc  berkeley,  mit,  and  the  university  of  chicago,  was  launched  in  partnership  with  lightapp.  project  engage  focused  on  manufacturers  that  were  heavy  energy  consumersand  use  compressed  air  in  their  manufacturing  process.
__label__energymonitoringmanagement according  to  the  e2e  website,compressed  air  use  was  chosen  because  of  the  variety  and  number  ofmanufacturers  that  use  compressed  air  technology,  from  companies  that  make  aerospaceparts  to  food  manufacturers.  in  some  plants,  compressors  use  more  electricity  than  any  othertype  of  machinery.  given  that  compressed  air  is  expensive  to  produce,  necessaryto  maintain  production,  and  often  wasteful,  but  leaks  and  inefficiencies  do  notprovide  an  immediate  danger  to  people  or  the  manufacturing  process,  researchersfelt  that  it  was  an  ideal  testing  medium.  they  set  an  initial  target  of  100  participating  facilities  incalifornia  for  the  program,  and  funding  was  secured  to  subsidize  some  of  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement participationcosts.  to  take  part,  companies  had  to  be  willing  to  complete  the  yearlong,  fourphaseproject  and  to  share  data  regarding  their  energy  use  and  how  it  changed  overthe  course  of  the  year.  after  the  project  ended,  they  would  be  offered  anopportunity  to  continue  using  the  program  as  a  paid  option.  researchers  wanted  a  userfriendly,  comprehensive  tool  to  track  usage  data  and  show  how  that  data  could  be  leveraged  to  improve  efficiency  and  save  money,as  well  as  a  solution  that  could  offer  realtime  performance  data  using  iot  technology  on  the  plant  floor.  data  analytics  and  industrial  iot  solution  company  lightapp  was  approached
__label__energymonitoringmanagement because  of  their  commitment  to  helping  aging  manufacturing  plants  and  utilities  work  smarter  and  run  in  a  more  sustainable  and  profitable  manner.  is  an  empirically  proven,  costeffective  approach  to  save  energy  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.the  way  we  see  it  is,  theres  a  lot  of  data  on  the  shop  floor,  and  there  has  been  for  quite  a  while,  said  lightapp  ceo  elhay  farkash.  controllers,  loggers,  and  various  devices  have  been  capturingdata  using  it  systems  since  the  late  seventies,  but  most  of  those  protocolswere  developed  over  40  years  ago.  new  protocols  have  emerged,  but  the  cost  ofcontrollers  and  sensors  have  historically
__label__energymonitoringmanagement been  a  barrier  to  widespread  adoption,he  said.  farkash  said  that  hardware  and  installation  costs  have  come  down  considerably,  providing  an  opportunity  to  give  manufacturers  an  affordable  way  to  better  understand  energy  use.  data  collection  and  storage  has  also  become  faster,  easier,  and  more  affordable.  even  a  power  meter  used  to  cost  thousands  of  dollars  about  six  or  seven  years  ago.  today  we  can  get  a  power  meter  with  communication  capabilities  and  everything  around  it  for  about  200.  initial  steps  involved  finding  the  companies  and  getting  theiragreement  to  participate  in  the  program,  as  well  as  the  acquisition  of  funds  tosubsidize  costs
__label__energymonitoringmanagement ofsensors,controllers,  and  the  communications  portion  of  the  datacapture  kit.  sponsorfunding  was  an  important  part  of  the  project,  allowing  researchers  to  ensurethat  results  would  not  be  affected  by  a  companys  ability  or  desire  to  pay  forparticipation.  all  facilities  received  free  installation  of  the  equipment,  and  70  percent  of  facilities  received  the  lightapp  software  for  free.  thirty  percent  of  facilities  received  the  for  a  discounted  monthly  rate.  customer  data  was  provided  by  southern  california  edison  and  pacific  gas  and  electric,  and  a  randomized  list  of  more  than  1,000  industrial  facilities  was  created.  after  a  company  was  enrolled,  lightapp  performed  a  map  and
__label__energymonitoringmanagement gapanalysis  to  assess  a  plants  readiness  for  participation,  providing  a  listingof  existing  and  needed  sensors,  and  a  check  on  the  functioning  of  any  existingsensors.  we  have  them  identify  all  the  different  resources  and  utilities  thatthey  currently  use  on  the  shop  floor,  farkash  said,  creating  a  model  of  theirexisting  facility.  each  company  was  then  provided  with  a  customized  iot  kit  thatcontained  any  needed  power  meters,  a  flow  meter,  a  pressure  sensor,  and  acellular  communication  gateway  with  edge  capabilities.  once  hardware  was  inplace,  and  the  realtime  data  capture  process  was  rigorously  tested  foraccuracy,  data  was  collected  from  each  company  for  a  threemonth
__label__energymonitoringmanagement baselinesettingperiod.  results  of  data  collection  during  this  time  were  not  shared  withthe  company  until  the  three  months  were  over,  at  which  point  their  users  were  givenfull  access  to  lightapp.  after  the  assessment,  data  collected  during  the  baseline  periodwas  shared  with  users,  along  with  information  about  potential  savings  and  howto  realize  those  savings.  analysis  of  costs  could  be  viewed  by  system  or  by  machine.  plants  were  able  to  set  goals  to  compete  against  themselves,against  manufacturer  specifications,  and  against  all  plants  using  lightappsplatform,  farkash  said.  the  app  tracks  motor  health,  notifies  the  appropriate  personnelto  take  action  to  do  maintenance  to  prevent  unplanned
__label__energymonitoringmanagement downtime,  and  makesrecommendations  based  on  comparison  to  best  practices  and  benchmarks.  customers  received  access  to  lightapp  for  12  months  to  use  insights  andmake  changes.  at  the  end  of  the  year,  participants  were  asked  three  questions:  a  total  of  102  industrial  plants  throughout  the  state  ofcalifornia  participated,  and  41  percent  decided  to  purchase  lightapp  after  theproject  closed.  so  far,  45  percent  have  requested  expansion  beyond  compressedair  systems.  the  results  for  energy  savings  are  pending  further  analysis,  andnumbers  will  be  released  at  a  later  date,  farkash  said.  initially,  customers  were  wary  of  a  cloud  solution  and  wantedan  onpremise  option,  he  said.  today
__label__energymonitoringmanagement its  not  a  problem  its  not  even  aquestion  that  our  solution  is  on  the  cloud,  so  customers  can  enjoy  thebenefits  of  the  clouds  economy  of  scale,  he  said.  users  can  work  with  lightapp  on  a  desktop,  in  their  facility,or  on  their  mobile  phones.  when  they  go  out  to  the  shop  floor  to  take  action,they  use  it  where  its  most  comfortable  for  them.  they  dont  need  to  sit  neartheir  desk  on  their  company  computers  in  order  to  see  the  data.  companies  received  access  to  realtime  performance  data  and  customizablereports  regarding  energy  usage  and  targeted  action  items  for  efficiencyimprovements.  sites  were  able
__label__energymonitoringmanagement to  monetize  their  compressed  air  system  inefficienciesand  leverage  this  knowledge  when  seeking  funding  for  repairs  and  equipmentreplacements.  plant  managers  could  compare  their  performance  to  other  plantsin  california  on  an  anonymous  basis,  providing  context  for  the  efficiencyratings.  laurie  ten  hope,  deputydirector  of  the  california  energy  commissions  research  and  developmentdivision,  said,  climate  change  impacts  all  of  us,  so  its  great  to  see  thishighly  successful  project  we  supported  extended  to  industry  in  othercommunities.  ben  duncan,  process  improvement  engineer  at  pepsi,  said:  the  engage  project  was  a  great,  lowrisk  way  to  learn  how  lightapps  software  worked  and  where  it  could  be  applied  in  our
__label__energymonitoringmanagement plant  to  improve  our  operations.  we  started  with  one  system,  and  quickly  recognized  the  value  and  importance  of  expanding  lightapp  to  other  areas  of  our  plant.  farkash  said  that  the  goal  of  the  project  is  to  save  energy  and  make  manufacturing  more  sustainable,  which  is  very  important  both  for  the  manufacturers  themselves,  and  for  the  world.  the  reduction  in  energy  consumption  goes  directly  to  the  bottom  line.  i  think  the  most  important  part  for  them  aside  from  energy  consumption  reduction  and  less  pollution,  was  to  make  california  manufacturers  more  competitive,  and  we  were  able  to  actually  see  it  through  the

__label__energymonitoringmanagement while  new  sensor,  mobile  and  wireless  technologies  are  driving  the  evolution  of  the  internet  of  things  iot,  the  true  business  value  of  the  iot  lies  in  big  data  rather  than  hardware  novelties.  after  all,  why  transmit  information  from  iot  devices  to  the  end  user  if  you  dont  have  an  analytics  platform  rich  enough  to  extract  insights  from  it  or  transform  it  into  meaningful  consumer  experiences?  weve  spoken  with  some  leading  software  developers  who  are  pioneering  the  bleeding  edge  of  iot  analytics  to  help  you  understand  how  its  enabling  transformative  business  opportunities.  heres  what  well  cover:  the  first  thing  to  understand
__label__energymonitoringmanagement about  analytics  on  iot  data  is  that  it  involves  datasets  generated  by  sensors,  which  are  now  both  cheap  and  sophisticated  enough  to  support  a  seemingly  endless  variety  of  use  cases.  the  potential  of  sensors  lies  in  their  ability  to  gather  data  about  the  physical  environment,  which  can  then  be  analyzed  or  combined  with  other  forms  of  data  to  detect  patterns.  dr.  joachim  schaper  is  senior  vice  president  of  research  and  head  of  the  advanced  analytics  lab  at  a  leading  player  in  the  emerging  iot  analytics  market.  his  views  represent  the  combined  expertise  and  experience  of  agts  rd  team,  which  includes
__label__energymonitoringmanagement more  than  80  people.  schaper  explains  that  sensor  data  can  also  be  used  to  understand  people  as  well  as  things:  the  ability  of  sensors  to  understand  physics  reveals  some  of  the  realtime  context  around  a  given  person,  which  can  then  be  combined  with  the  expressiveness  of  social  media  data  to  yield  a  strong  understanding  of  an  individual  person  or  a  group  of  people.  if  this  is  done  right,  it  can  enable  a  huge  set  of  new  services  for  the  consumer.  the  following  video  shows  agts  solutions  at  work.  in  this  example,  machine  learningassisted  video  analytics  track  an  audiences  movements  during

__label__energymonitoringmanagement transformative  business  impacts  across  a  number  of  verticals.  iot  solutions  have  the  potential  to  completely  rewrite  how  businesses  think  of  their  customers.  one  way  in  which  this  is  happening  already  is  by  analyzing  information  about  how  consumers  use  a  businesss  internetconnected  products.  by  way  of  example,  take  the  following  dashboard  from  ,  a  developer  of  selfservice  and  guided  analytics  solutions:  product  usage  data  collated  with  social  media  and  revenue  data  in  farnaz  erfan,  senior  director  of  product  strategy  at  birst,  explains  how  iot  connected  coffee  makers  transmit  information  to  the  manufacturer  about  how  many  pots  of  coffee  a  consumer  is
__label__energymonitoringmanagement brewing  per  day.  this  data  can  then  be  correlated  with  social  media  data  to  determine  whether  consumers  who  brew  more  coffee  are  more  likely  to  be  actively  discussing  the  brand  on  social  media.  additionally,  the  vendor  can  see  whether  variations  in  the  amount  of  coffee  brewed  by  consumers  correspond  to  the  amount  of  coffee  capsules  also  sold  by  the  vendor.  one  fascinating  aspect  of  analytics  on  iot  data  that  erfan  highlights  is  the  potential  for  analytics  to  be  both  businessfacing  and  consumerfacing  at  the  same  time.  by  way  of  example,  erfan  mentions  a  birst  deployment  for  a  utilities  client  selling
__label__energymonitoringmanagement smart  energy  meters  that  dont  require  meter  readers:  they  sell  into  state  and  county  governments  as  well  as  private  energy  providers,  so  that  organizations  can  perform  fraud  detection  on  the  meter  data  as  well  as  revenue  projections.  the  other  channel,  however,  is  consumeroriented,  she  says,  as  the  analytics  enable  portals  for  consumers  to  manage  their  energy  consumption,  see  how  much  theyre  over  and  under  other  households  in  the  neighborhood,  turn  appliances  on  and  off  to  determine  how  they  impact  energy  usage  etc.  in  this  case,  the  business  generates  value  from  the  same  analytics  in  two  ways:  one  of  the  most
__label__energymonitoringmanagement exciting  domains  in  iot  analytics  is  the  emerging  field  of  social  analytics.  social  analytics  involves  using  sensor  data,  video  data,  social  media  data  etc.  to  gain  actionable  insights  into  the  personalities  and  behaviors  of  individuals  and  groups.  agt  has  helped  to  establish  this  field  through  its  pioneering  focus  on  connected  events.  schaper  explains  that  at  connected  events,  the  things  on  which  sensors  are  deployed  are  people:  we  have  created  a  complete  solution  on  mobile  with  the  respective  backend  analytics  for  fashion  and  for  the  european  basketball  league.  what  weve  done  there  is  to  deploy  iot  sensors  at  the  venue,  on
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  models  in  the  case  of  fashion  shows  and  on  the  referees  and  coaches  in  the  case  of  basketball  games.  these  sensors  enable  the  analysis  of  human  emotions  rather  than  device  usage  a  form  of  analytics  known  as  sentiment  analysis  .  dr.  gadi  lenz,  agts  chief  scientist,  explains  that  biometric  sensors  and  networks  are  important  enabling  technologies  for  sentiment  analysis:  agt  is  using  video  facial  expressions,  accelerometers  and  gyros  motion,  audio  cheering  and  booing,  heart  rate  excitement,  skin  conductance  stress  etc.,  coupled  with  machinelearning  based  analytics  to  infer  peoples  emotions  in  a  way  that  was  not  possible  before.  for  instance,
__label__energymonitoringmanagement schaper  explains  that  biometric  sensors  on  coaches  link  the  motions  of  this  notoriously  fidgety  demographic  to  their  feelings  about  the  game,  as  we  saw  in  the  video  at  .  weve  created  a  socalled  agitation  index  for  coaches,  which  analyzes  movement  to  measure  their  level  of  involvement  throughout  the  game.  if  you  then  relate  this  data  to  the  game  data  when  free  throws  happen,  when  3pointers  happen  etc.,  you  get  very  interesting  correlations.  using  agts  video  analytics  to  create  an  agitation  index  for  coaches  much  of  what  agt  does  at  connected  events  extends  beyond  sensor  data  into  the  field  of  video
__label__energymonitoringmanagement analytics,  particularly  a  form  of  analytics  based  on  machine  learning  that  agt  calls  video  anomaly  detection.  he  explains  that  this  kind  of  video  analytics  takes  the  raw  input  from  a  camera  and  learns  the  scene.  facial  recognition  and  motion  detection  are  both  crucial  areas  in  enabling  social  analytics  via  video.  in  the  case  of  fashion  shows,  schaper  notes,  we  can  use  motion  detection  to  determine  where  the  audience  is  actually  looking  to  detect  events  that  draw  the  attention  of  the  whole  group.  we  measure  that  by  looking  at  their  faces  and  using  eye  position  and  mouth  position  to  understand  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement focus  and  level  of  interest  of  the  person.  currently,  social  analytics  is  creating  business  value  through  supporting  the  video  capture  of  important  moments  at  events.  by  analyzing  the  emotions,  behaviors  and  focal  points  of  a  crowd  to  pinpoint  the  highlights  of  the  event,  video  clips  can  be  created  that  tie  in  naturally  with  the  interests  of  the  crowd  and,  by  extension,  online  viewers  as  well.  agts  video  analytics  have  helped  in  the  creation  of  short  stories  and  youtube  clips  by  delivering  recommendations  to  editors  about  which  moments  at  an  event  were  most  significant  for  the  audience  and  for  participants.  schaper
__label__energymonitoringmanagement notes  that  this  content  went  on  to  rack  up  2  million  views  across  facebook  and  youtube,  along  with  branded  videos  showing  the  use  of  machine  learning  to  understand  the  emotional  states  of  models:  agt  machinelearning  technologies  read  models  emotional  states  protecting  infrastructure  goes  beyond  predictive  maintenance,  and  frequently  people  need  protection  from  infrastructure.  agt  actually  got  its  start  in  protecting  oilfield  infrastructure  through  deployments  of  cameras  alongside  motion  and  radar  sensors.  in  surveillance  contexts,  the  detection  of  anomalies  is  crucial,  and  agt  does  this  through  a  novel  mechanism:  we  let  the  machine  try  to  figure  out  what  the  state  of
__label__energymonitoringmanagement the  feed  is  and  derive  normal  or  abnormal  things  over  time.  we  create  anomaly  indices,  and  if  something  pushes  past  threshold  its  counted  as  an  anomaly.  human  operators  monitoring  the  sensor  feeds  can  even  adjust  the  threshold  for  what  counts  as  an  event  worthy  of  their  attention,  as  in  the  following  example  of  a  traffic  management  system  based  on  video  analytics:  adjusting  anomaly  indices  in  agts  videobased  traffic  management  system  the  line  in  the  graph  at  the  bottom  represents  the  threshold  of  significance  set  by  the  operator,  while  peaks  indicate  anomalous  events  a  stalled  car,  a  car  moving  in  the
__label__energymonitoringmanagement wrong  direction  etc.  that  pass  the  threshold  and  hence  require  the  attention  of  a  human  being.  because  this  technology  is  based  on  machine  learning,  schaper  explains,  users  dont  have  to  define  complex  rules  to  determine  what  counts  as  an  event.  instead,  the  software  itself  figures  this  out:  if  you  use  this  in  traffic,  the  analytics  will  learn  that  there  are  four  lanes,  two  in  each  direction,  and  typically  the  car  flow  goes  on  the  left  side  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  and  on  the  right  side  from  the  bottom  to  the  top.  if  the  analytics  detect  a  strong  movement
__label__energymonitoringmanagement from  left  to  right  in  the  video  signal,  thats  an  indication  of  an  accident  and  the  analytics  will  trigger  an  alarm.  such  technologies  are  useful  for  adjusting  operations,  as  well  as  for  ensuring  safety.  agts  video  analytics  are  also  being  used  to  manage  crowd  movements  in  queues  and  crowd  density  at  events.  the  use  cases  weve  examined  should  give  you  some  idea  of  the  breadth  of  what  you  can  achieve  with  iot  analytics.  we  havent  covered  the  details  of  the  enabling  technologies  behind  iot  platforms,  which  use  specialized  types  of  data  science  to  deal  with  vast,  realtime  datasets  generated  by
__label__energymonitoringmanagement sensors.  research  firm  gartner  covers  these  technologies,  along  with  artificial  intelligence  and  industrial  iot  tools,  and  the  analytical  methods  used  with  them  in  a  report  on  this  content  is  available  to  gartner  clients.  if  youre  looking  to  begin  comparing  vendors,  reference  our  of  endtoend  bi  platforms.  many  of  these  vendors  can  act  as  technology  partners  for  iot  projects,  as  weve  seen  in  the  examples  discussed  in  this  report.  supply  chain  analytics  trends:  the  internet  of  things  and  more  evolve  your  customer  segmentation  methods  with  clustering  what  is  data  blending,  and  which  tools  make  it  easier?
