__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  architecture.  the  service  basically  have  two  endpoints:  ingestion  service  and  query  service.  an  ingestion  service  is  a  web  socket  based  hook  to  data  streaming  predix  services.  in  our  microservice  java  app,  we  are  going  to  tap  into  this  hook  and  expose  a  service  end  point.  7.  bind  both  time  series  and  uaa  with  your  created  app  figure  4.13:  binding  service  instances  with  main  app  after  service  instance  binding  with  the  app,  you  can  check  the  binding  by  going  to  your  predix.io  console  and  exploring  your  ts,  which  we  have  named  as  rupamts.  figure  4.14  verifying  service  bind  9.  getting

__label__machineconditionmonitoring which  can  be  called  by  other  services  and  not  by  any  device.  but,  we  want  our  industrial  accelerometer  to  be  able  to  put  data  into  predix  cloud  using  time  series  service.  right?  for  that  we  need  to  define  the  api  end  point  for  the  microservice.  so  ,  i  have  added  the  endpoint  to  expose  our  bootstrap  microservice  to  outside  world  using  standard  spring  methods.  the  main  beans  class  provided  by  bootstrap  application  is  class  which  defines  methods  for  connecting  and  streaming  data  to  predix  cloud.  are  the  sample  methods  provided  with  the  implemeentation.  however,  we  want  to  stream  a  time
__label__machineconditionmonitoring series  data  and  not  the  binary  or  text  data.  interestingly  the  class  under  implements  the  methods  that  you  need  to  look  into.  method  is  the  method  that  allows  you  to  send  time  series  data  single  entry  to  predix  cloud  using  websocket  client.  however,  you  can  not  send  data  of  any  arbitory  format.  you  need  to  send  a  json  data,  that  too  specific  to  predix  supported  format,  which  includes  messageid,  interval,  number  of  fileds  and  tag.  tag  is  the  field  using  which  the  query  service  identifies  your  data  series.  so,  we  update  the  method  such  that  it  supports  predix  specific  data
__label__machineconditionmonitoring entry  as  bellwo.  the  next  part  is  to  define  an  api  endpoint.  this  is  done  by  using  the  request  mapping  technique:  so,  yourpredixwebappurl/hello?namefieldnamevaluefieldvalue  becomes  your  complete  get  url  for  calling  the  service  which  will  internally  call  postdatatest  which  will  format  the  data  according  to  predix  specific  format.  execute  the  netbeans  project.  by  default  the  local  service  will  run  at  port  9000.  so  in  browser  if  you  enter,  localhost:9000/hello?nameaccxvalue33  its  going  to  enter  33  against  a  tag  named  accx.  having  tested  the  data  locally,  all  you  need  to  do  is  to  deploy  the  app  in  the  cloud.  go  to  the  bootstrap
__label__machineconditionmonitoring app  directory  and  use  cf  push.  but  before  you  are  able  to  push  the  app  to  predix  cloud,  you  need  to  configure  this  and  update  the  pom.xml  in  the  project  direcory.  here  is  the  pom  of  our  sample  project.  figure  4.18:  data  storage  through  local  api  endpoint  click  to  enlarge  we  need  to  use  cf  push  for  pushing  the  project  to  cloud.  go  to  project  directory,  that  contains  pom.xml,  manifest.yml.  cf  reads  the  configuration  from  manifest.yml.  so  open  your  pom,  see  the  artifact  id  and  put  it  in  yml  file.  then  go  to  target  directory,  see  the  .jar  file  and
__label__machineconditionmonitoring enter  the  name  as  target.  here  is  pom.xml  snippet  you  need  to  change  the  yml  file  accordingly  here  is  the  yml  file:  path  should  be  relative  path  to  the  compiled  jar  file  which  generally  will  be  in  target  directory.  server  port0  helps  the  cloud  to  configure  the  server  port  to  the  available  port  rather  than  binding  to  a  specific  port  which  might  not  always  be  available  due  to  other  services.  go  to  console  and  see  cloud  url.  figure  4.19:  cloud  api  end  point  for  your  data  ingestion  service  you  can  push  the  data  the  way  you  have  pushed  locally  or
__label__machineconditionmonitoring use  our  api  endpoint  till  our  free  trail  lasts  alright,  we  are  able  to  call  the  end  point  using  browser.  but  how  to  do  it  from  our  iot  device?  well  unix  provides  a  great  command  called  curl  using  which  you  can  call  any  websites  using  your  command  prompt.  calling  the  service  from  command  prompt  this  service  will  be  called  by  our  iot  device  using  curl  utility.  so  in  command  prompt  type  curl  followed  by  the  above  urland  check  if  the  data  is  posted  or  not.  you  can  go  to  api  explorer  section  in  predix  starter  web.  put  the  zone  id
__label__machineconditionmonitoring of  the  time  series  query  in  the  zone  id  field,  select  timedependent  data.  it  will  by  default  open  a  json  format  for  1y  data.  just  change  the  name  and  limit  to  finally  see  your  hardwork  bearing  fruit  :  figure  4.20  validating  data  ingestion  using  query  essentially  the  application  must  also  have  a  visualization  client.  but  the  complexity  of  the  development  with  predix  ecosystem  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  article.  you  can  obtain  the  data  through  api  explorer  and  parse  using  any  json  parser  to  get  the  data  array  which  you  can  save  in  any  format.  if  you  want  to

__label__machineconditionmonitoring somethimes  an  access  of  lathe  and  industry  standard  monitoring  service  is  not  always  available.  however,  you  can  regenerate  the  use  case  using  some  simple  hardware  setup.  we  present  an  intel  edison  based  environment  using  which  we  can  send  data  to  our  created  predix  data  ingestion  endpoint.  irrespective  of  who  you  are  and  what  level  of  experties  you  have,  if  you  are  working  with  iot,  nothing  gives  you  as  much  pleasure  as  real  time  data  mitigation  to  cloud  gives.  partially  because  iot  afterall  is  connecting  the  things  and  how  do  you  say  that  things  are  connected,  if  they  are  not  on
__label__machineconditionmonitoring cloud?  the  data  push  through  real  devices  serves  many  other  purposes  than  just  satisfying  the  developer.  it  can  act  as  a  test  bench  for  studying  latency,  roboustness  and  throughput  of  the  system.  therefore  we  though  that  it  would  be  a  goodf  idea  if  we  can  replicate  the  scenerio  that  we  developed  in  section  3  so  that  developers  can  reproduce  the  real  use  case.  as  we  have  learnt  from  section  3  that  rul  prediction  can  be  essentially  performed  using  industial  grade  3  axis  accelerometer.  but  donw  worry  if  you  dont  have  it.  you  can  always  use  low  cost  iot  prototyping  boards
__label__machineconditionmonitoring like  raspberry  pi  or  intel  edison  for  this.  figure  5.1  accelerometer  connection  with  edison  connecting  accelerometer  with  edison  is  real  simple.  just  connect  it  to  the  i2c  port  of  grove  base  shield  as  shown  above.  node.js  has  edison  accelerometer  package  install  the  package  with  npm.  the  example  code  for  logging  accelerometer  data  is  present  with  the  package.  we  are  going  to  fork  the  code  and  add  curl  command  to  push  the  data  to  predix  cloud.  the  method  keeps  looping  in  every  50ms  therefore  producing  a  samplig  rate  of  20hz,  too  low  for  comfort  gives  the  acceleration  across  three  axes.  use
__label__machineconditionmonitoring anaother  npm  package  called  sys,  that  allows  you  to  call  unix  system  calls  from  node.js.  use  childprocess  to  execute  the  system  call  as  a  separate  thread.  lets  assume  that  we  want  to  store  xacceleration  thats  it.  its  going  to  put  the  data  in  your  predix  cloud.  you  can  modify  the  microservice  to  post  multiple  data  simultaneously  as  chunk  as  we  have  discussed  at  the  begnning.  now  you  can  simulate  the  system  and  can  see  the  data.  use  any  standard  programming  lanuages  to  consume  the  rest  apis  from  query  service  to  obtain  the  result  data  which  you  can  use  for  your
__label__machineconditionmonitoring analytical  framework.  in  this  tutorial  we  have  elaborated  the  process  of  analyzing  tool  lifetime  using  accelerometer  data  in  real  industrial  setup.  we  have  presented  the  sensors  and  other  components  along  with  the  industrial  setup  and  standards  for  data  acquisition.  then  we  have  introduced  predix  time  series  based  data  streaming  and  ingestion  services  for  taking  the  data  collection  process  to  cloud.  we  then  presented  a  simulation  driven  method  to  simulate  the  industrial  setup  and  test  the  service  with  intel  edison.  we  have  also  provided  the  recorded  dataset,  003  is  first  row  of  table  3.5,  004  is  next  row  and  so  on.

__label__machineconditionmonitoring search  by  ,  fredric  paul  is  editor  in  chief  for  new  relic,  inc.,  and  has  held  senior  editorial  positions  at  readwrite,  informationweek,  cnet,  and  pc  world.  his  opinions  are  his  own.  two  years  ago,  predictive  maintenance  was  forecast  to  be  one  of  the  most  promising  uses  of  the  industrial  internet  of  things  iot.  thats  the  lead  of  report  based  on  a  recent  survey  of  more  than  600  hightech  executives  ,  by  bain  partners  michael  schallehn,  christopher  schorling,  peter  bowen  and  oliver  straehle.  the  report  goes  on  to  note  that  identifying  precisely  when  equipment  might  fail  seemed  like  a  nobrainer.  and
__label__machineconditionmonitoring yet,  the  report  concludes,  predictive  maintenance  has  failed  to  take  off  as  broadly  as  expected.  in  fact,  industrial  leaders  were  not  as  excited  about  predictive  maintenance  as  they  were  back  in  a  2016  survey.  according  to  bain,  there  have  been  problems  on  the  both  sides  of  the  ball:  first,  implementing  has  been  harder  than  expected,  and  second,  deriving  valuable  insights  from  the  data  gathered  has  also  turned  out  to  be  unexpectedly  challenging.  but  wait,  it  gets  worse.  it  seems  that  predictive  maintenance  is  just  one  of  many  iot  use  cases  that  customers  have  had  difficulty  integrating  into  their  existing  operational
__label__machineconditionmonitoring technology  and  it  systems.  while  investment  in  proofofconcept  projects  continues,  the  bain  report  said,  actually  turning  that  into  successful  mainstream  implementations  hasnt  been  able  to  keep  up.  longterm  enthusiasm  for  the  technology  remains  strong,  the  survey  showed,  but  many  industrial  organizations  now  foresee  implementation  taking  longer  than  initially  predicted.  bain  still  predicts  the  market  to  double  by  2021,  topping  200  billion.  those  delays  come  along  with  a  shift  in  the  concerns  of  industrial  iot  users.  in  2016,  top  concerns  centered  on  security,  return  on  investment,  and  integrating  iot  solutions  with  existing  it  systems.  after  a  couple  years  of  poc  projects,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring security  remains  a  key  concern  in  2018,  and  worries  around  gathering  sufficient  technical  expertise,  dealing  with  multiple  data  formats,  and  transition  risks  have  become  even  more  intense.  roi  concerns,  meanwhile,  have  faded  a  bit.  could  it  be  that  industrial  iot  projects  are  actually  paying  off?  none  of  this  should  come  as  a  huge  surprise.  the  transition  from  promising  vision  to  practical  success  often  faces  unforeseen  roadblocks.  but  while  these  impediments  can  loom  large  during  the  early  adoption  phase,  they  tend  to  be  quickly  forgotten  once  the  technology  achieves  widespread  success,  indeed,  the  bain  report  notes  that  given  the  progress  in
__label__machineconditionmonitoring sensor  technology,  5g  connectivity,  edge  computing  and  edge  analytics,  and  an  estimated  20  billion  devices  connected  by  2020,  theres  little  doubt  of  the  potential  for  technology  to  vastly  improve  efficiency  and  no  doubt  that  the  iot  will  have  to  manage  it.  to  overcome  these  issues,  bain  says,  analytics  firms,  industrial  technology  makers  and  cloud  service  providers  must  help  their  customers  gain  deeper  experience  in  industryspecific  applications  and  offer  more  complete,  endtoend  iot  solutions.  in  the  short  run,  though,  that  may  not  be  so  easy,  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  first,  industrial  iot  vendors  and  users  dont  always  agree  on  whats
__label__machineconditionmonitoring important  and  whats  ready  for  prime  time,  the  bain  survey  revealed.  for  example,  while  quality  control  and  remote  monitoring  and  tracking  of  equipment  ranked  high  among  both  groups,  customers  wanted  augmented  reality/virtual  reality  ar/vr  and  energy  management  solutions,  which  vendors  were  less  ready  to  deliver.  on  the  other  hand,  vendors  said  they  were  ready  to  deploy  predictive  maintenance  solutions,  but  its  not  clear  customers  are  waiting  in  line  to  buy  them.  notably,  smartcity  use  cases,  which  have  received  a  lot  of  press  attention,  were  not  top  of  the  list  for  either  vendors  or  customers.  software  deficiencies  also  remain  a  problem.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring according  to  bain,  device  makers  and  other  vendors  of  industrial  and  operational  technology  need  to  dramatically  improve  their  software  capabilitiesnot  a  historical  strength  for  most  of  them.  the  report  notes  that  many  vendors  are  spending  freely  on  acquisitions  to  accumulate  the  required  capabilities.  finally,  bain  suggests  that  industrial  iot  vendors  focus  on  enabling  key  use  cases  and  overcoming  critical  barriers,  plus  leverage  partnerships  to  fill  the  inevitable  capability  gaps.  fredric  paul  is  editor  in  chief  for  new  relic,  inc.,  and  has  held  senior  editorial  positions  at  readwrite,  informationweek,  cnet,  pcworld  and  other  publications.  his  opinions  are  his  own.  take  idgs

__label__machineconditionmonitoring as  part  of  ,  we  identified  110  of  the  technology  firms  that  have  worked  on  predictive  maintenance  implementations  in  the  past,  stemming  from  five  different  segments:  we  also  analyzed  startups,  most  of  which  offer  software  solutions  for  predictive  maintenance,  including  platform  and  analytics.  to  better  understand  how  active  individual  companies  are  in  the  domain  of  predictive  maintenance,  we  calculated  a  company  ranking  for  predictive  maintenance  companies  based  on  the  same  methodology  as  the  popular  and  based  on  data  from  2016.  :  the  ranking  is  an  how  visibly  specific  companies  present  themselves  regarding  this  topic.  a  correlation  between  the  ranking  and

__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  get  your  spreadsheet  to  rank  potential  candidates  for  iotbased  predictive  maintenance.  predictive  maintenance  is  one  of  the  areas  that  benefit  most  from  machine  learning  algorithms  with  predictive  capability.  predictive  maintenance  has  always  focused  on  how  to  predict  when  certain  conditions  are  going  to  occur  and  when  machines  will  fail.  with  the  advent  of  machine  learning  and  the  ability  to  do  it  at  scale,  you  now  have  a  unique  use  case.  predictive  maintenance  is  not  just  reserved  for  a  few  large  organizations  anymore.  its  now  available  to  use  for  a  broad  range  of  assetintensive  industry  applications.  we  often  get  questions
__label__machineconditionmonitoring around,  how  do  we  get  started  with  predictive  maintenance?.  and  especially,  how  do  we  use  the  internet  of  things  to  do  predictive  maintenance,  not  just  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  but  on  a  realtime  continuous  basis?  before  i  jump  into  what  iot  predictive  maintenance  solutions  look  like,  heres  a  quick  history  of  how  maintenance  has  evolved  over  the  last  couple  of  decades.  you  started  off  with  reactive  maintenance.  when  things  broke  down,  you  would  go  out  and  fix  that.  then  some  preventative  maintenance  started  to  occur  where  you  would  do  it  based  on  fixed  schedules.  its  like  when  you  take
__label__machineconditionmonitoring your  car  in  for  scheduled  maintenance  every  10  000  miles  or  every  12  months.  theres  a  certain  threshold  and  that  dictates  when  maintenance  will  occur.  you  would  often  maintain  equipment  that  doesnt  need  maintaining.  or  you  would  find  things  break  down  before  that  scheduled  interval.  in  the  case  of  warranties,  manufacturers  are  trying  to  limit  their  risk.  so  they  create  those  service  intervals  to  minimize  any  impact  it  would  have  for  them.  using  the  manufacturers  warranty  that  they  set  up  initially  as  your  continued  interval  for  scheduled  maintenance  may  not  be  the  best  schedule  to  maintain  assets  on  a  longterm
__label__machineconditionmonitoring basis.  quite  often  assets  are  maintained  on  a  higher  frequency  than  what  is  required.  and  quite  often  those  maintenance  interventions  also  create  what  we  would  call  maintenance  induced  failures.  if  it  aint  broke  dont  fix  it  is  another  way  of  looking  at  that.  you  got  smarter  around  understanding  the  condition  of  equipment  by  taking  measurements  with  vibration  monitors  or  ultrasonic  devices.  you  would  listen  to  cavitation  on  pumps  and  measure  the  vibration  on  certain  equipment.  you  created  a  predictive  maintenance  capability  but  it  was  still  manual.  this  has  been  around  for  quite  a  while  but  it  often  required  an  operator
__label__machineconditionmonitoring going  out  with  a  measuring  device.  they  would  have  to  physically  go  out  on  a  schedule,  take  certain  readings,  capture  that  data  and  plot  it  out.  they  would  spend  hours  creating  spreadsheets.  then  based  on  their  analysis,  they  would  come  up  with  a  predictive  maintenance  schedule  based  on  the  condition  of  the  equipment.  it  was  a  great  idea  but  the  execution  was  done  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  the  advent  of  internet  of  things  is  changing  the  way  we  do  predictive  maintenance.  you  can  now  have  realtime  monitoring  devices  at  a  low  cost  that  send  data  to  an  algorithm  on
__label__machineconditionmonitoring a  continuous  basis.  it  can  detect  whether  theres  something  going  wrong  with  a  machine  or  use  machine  learning  to  make  a  prediction.  that  is  where  predictive  maintenance  is  going  now  with  what  we  call  iotbased  predictive  maintenance.  here  are  the  four  main  blocks  of  how  maintenance  has  evolved:  you  can  now  take  advantage  of  having  realtime  sensors  installed  on  equipment.  they  will  provide  realtime  data  that  you  can  put  into  predictive  models  to  help  you  determine  when  something  is  about  to  fail  or  what  the  remaining  useful  life  is  for  that  equipment.  you  can  then  schedule  maintenance  based  on  that
__label__machineconditionmonitoring data.  another  question  that  we  often  get,  what  is  the  internet  of  things?  heres  a  great  definition  by  naveen  balani  in  his  book  enterprise  iot:  a  definitive  handbook:  internet  of  things  is  a  vision  where  every  object  in  the  world  has  the  potential  to  connect  to  the  internet  and  provide  their  data  so  as  to  derive  actionable  insights  on  its  own  or  through  other  connected  objects.  the  internet  of  things  is  not  about  connecting  a  whole  bunch  of  sensors  and  just  using  that  to  run  your  factory  on  a  daytoday  basis  or  get  information,  which  is  typically  on  the  automation
__label__machineconditionmonitoring control  side  of  the  business.  the  value  comes  from  taking  that  information  available  to  the  business  side  of  your  organization.  this  will  allow  them  to  create  actionable  insights  like  predictive  maintenance.  were  getting  insight  into  the  condition  of  the  equipment  and  then  based  on  that  we  can  plan  interventions.  we  can  either  take  one  sensor  or  it  can  be  a  combination  of  many  sensors  and  data  sources.  we  may  combine  weather  information  with  equipment  data  and  then  determine  when  to  send  a  crew  for  predictive  maintenance.  the  traditional  challenges  with  predictive  maintenance  were  that  the  data  was  limited  to  sensor
__label__machineconditionmonitoring data.  and  it  was  mostly  used  for  operational  control,  where  we  wanted  to  control  the  machines,  make  them  faster,  slower,  or  switch  them  on  and  off.  from  an  automation  perspective  just  around  the  control  side  of  things.  predictive  maintenance  was  often  based  on  predictive  analytics  that  required  expert  data  scientists  and  complex  machine  learning  models.  this  meant  that  machine  learning  was  limited  to  a  few  large  organizations.  it  wasnt  something  you  could  do  at  scale.  even  at  those  large  organizations,  you  had  to  do  it  on  a  batch  basis.  you  would  go  out  and  take  readings  and  put  that  data
__label__machineconditionmonitoring into  the  machine  learning  tools  to  come  up  with  schedules.  a  lot  has  changed  since  them.  you  now  have  the  ability  to  continuously  parse  data  through  machine  learning  models  and  continuously  get  predictions  back.  the  new  low  costs  mean  that  its  not  just  reserved  for  large  organizations  anymore.  its  also  available  to  small  and  mediumsized  businesses.  its  available  to  oems  and  equipment  manufacturers  that  want  to  provide  predictive  maintenance  services  with  the  equipment  they  are  selling.  the  biggest  question  that  we  get  is,  how  do  i  know  where  to  start  with  this  predictive  maintenance  thing?.  the  best  way  to  approach
__label__machineconditionmonitoring this  is  to  say,  where  will  i  find  the  most  roi  for  this?.  what  you  dont  want  to  do  is  start  it  with  all  the  equipment  and  all  the  potential  things  that  happen  in  your  business.  you  want  to  narrow  it  down  to  specific  pieces  of  equipment  that  will  give  you  the  best  return  on  investment  in  the  short  term,  and  then  expand  that  out.  we  often  start  with,  wheres  the  roi  in  the  business?.  thats  more  of  a  problem  driven  approach  than  a  discoverydriven  approach.  a  discoverydriven  approach,  which  we  see  quite  often,  is  where  you  say,  ive  got
__label__machineconditionmonitoring all  of  this  data,  what  can  i  do  with  it?  a  problemdriven  approach  focuses  on  something  specific  that  you  want  to  do.  i  want  to  reduce  the  downtime  of  my  cooling  tower  pumps.  if  i  can  reduce  that  by  ten  percent  i  know  what  the  impact  will  be.  what  maintenance  tasks  am  i  looking  to  improve?  we  like  to  restate  the  problem.  doing  this  ensures  that  we  start  with  the  business  question  that  were  trying  to  answer.  we  dont  start  with,  i  have  sensors,  what  can  i  predict?  wed  rather  start  with,  what  would  the  impact  of  zero  downtime  be
__label__machineconditionmonitoring for  certain  of  my  critical  assets?  for  example,  zero  downtime  on  my  cooling  tower  pumps  will  increase  production  yield  by  fifteen  percent.  that  helps  you  to  identify  the  assets  that  are  suitable  for  predictive  maintenance.  not  all  equipment  behaves  in  a  way  that  you  can  predict  its  likelihood  to  fail.  because  of  that,  you  also  need  to  do  a  further  analysis  by  taking  a  reliability  centered  maintenance  approach.  define  what  the  failure  modes  are  and  whether  those  failure  modes  are  completely  random  like  you  would  find  with  a  light  bulb,  or  if  you  can  understand  the  deterioration  and  predict  that
__label__machineconditionmonitoring it  is  likely  to  fail.  above  we  have  a  ranking  matrix  where  you  take  the  potential  failures  or  the  historical  failures  that  occurred  on  certain  equipment,  rank  the  number  of  occurrences  and  add  the  business  impact  that  it  has.  for  example:  if  a  cooling  tower  pump  goes  down,  does  it  bring  down  the  whole  production  line?  if  it  does,  the  impact  is  massive.  taking  a  matrix  based  approach  like  this,  we  analyze  the  failure  modes  for  specific  critical  equipment.  it  then  allows  you  to  create  a  ranking  matrix  with  four  quadrants.  you  look  at  the  business  impact  of  a  certain
__label__machineconditionmonitoring failure  and  assess  your  ability  to  do  predictive  maintenance  on  it,  by  asking  questions  like:  that  will  give  us  a  ranking  matrix.  we  do  this  on  a  scale  of  one  to  ten  on  each  axis.  now  we  look  at  the  cooling  tower  pump  example  and  the  failure  mode  where  there  is  complete  pump  failure.  we  have  existing  flow  meters  on  it  and  the  impact  is  significant.  this  is  an  area  where  we  would  like  to  start  with  predictive  maintenance  right  now.  just  below  that  are  two  other  areas  where  the  pump  fan  is  not  starting,  or  the  fan  wont  turn
__label__machineconditionmonitoring off.  this  means  the  water  temperature  is  wrong,  which  is  affecting  the  supply  to  the  production  plant.  those  two  scenarios  dont  have  detection  capabilities  yet,  but  the  impact  is  high.  its  easy  to  add  the  iot  sensorbased  detection  capabilities.  in  that  instance,  we  can  plan  for  that  and  get  it  ready.  the  other  two  axes  are  where  the  business  impact  is  low.  here  you  need  to  consider  whether  its  worth  your  while.  this  outlines  our  approach  to  deciding  which  assets  provide  the  most  leverage  for  iotbased  predictive  maintenance.  it  gives  you  a  businessoriented  system  to  follow,  which  focuses  on  the

__label__machineconditionmonitoring predictive  maintenance  is  one  of  the  most  tangible  applications  within  industry  4.0.  it  allows  status  data  to  be  obtained  from  machines  and  proactive  maintenance  to  be  carried  out  on  systems.  this  paper  uses  a  definition  and  practical  examples  to  explain  how  predictive  maintenance  works.  by  definition,  predictive  maintenance  refers  to  a  maintenance  process  that  is  based  on  the  evaluation  of  process  and  machine  data.  it  is  used  primarily  in  the  context  of  .  the  realtime  processing  of  underlying  data  makes  it  possible  to  make  forecasts  that  form  the  basis  for  needsbased  maintenance  and  consequently  the  reduction  of  downtimes.  besides  the
__label__machineconditionmonitoring interpretation  of  sensor  data,  this  requires  a  combination  of  realtime  analysis  technology  and  an  inmemory  database  in  order  to  achieve  a  higher  access  speed  to  the  data  compared  to  hard  disk  drives.  if  everything  works  out,  a  technician  can  be  assigned  to  solve  a  problem  before  it  occurs.  because:  business  objectives  can  only  be  achieved  if  plants,  machines  and  processes  function  perfectly.  with  the  help  of  technologies,  the  condition  of  machines  is  evaluated  in  order  to  predict  when  maintenance  needs  to  be  performed.  as  a  result,  cost  savings  can  be  achieved  over  routine  or  timebased  preventive  maintenance,  as  tasks  are
__label__machineconditionmonitoring only  performed  when  they  are  needed.  the  main  objective  of  predictive  maintenance  is  to  provide  the  most  precise  advance  maintenance  planning  and  to  avoid  unexpected  breakdowns.  knowing  when  a  particular  machine  needs  to  be  serviced  makes  it  easier  to  plan  resources  for  maintenance  work  such  as  spare  parts  or  personnel.  in  addition,  system  availability  can  be  increased  by  converting  unplanned  stops  into  ever  shorter  and  more  frequent  planned  stops  .  further  advantages  include  potentially  longer  service  life  of  the  plants,  increased  plant  safety,  fewer  accidents  with  negative  effects  on  the  environment  and  optimized  spare  parts  handling.  predictive  maintenance  categorizes  the
__label__machineconditionmonitoring condition  of  plants  by  checking  them  either  periodically  offline  or  continuously  online.  in  the  ideal  case,  it  is  possible  to  make  upcoming  maintenance  not  only  as  cost  efficient  as  possible,  but  also  performance  efficient,  i.e.  even  before  the  machine  is  losing  performance.  in  order  to  keep  interruptions  to  regular  system  operation  to  a  minimum,  most  predictive  inspections  can  be  carried  out  during  plant  operation.  for  the  assessment  of  the  actual  state  of  a  machine,  an  examination  by  means  of  infrared,  acoustics  partial  discharge  and  ultrasound,  corona  detection,  vibration  analysis  and  sound  level  measurements  can  be  used.  of  course,  such  test
__label__machineconditionmonitoring procedures  must  not  impair  the  function  of  the  machine  or  even  damage  it.  a  more  recent  approach  is  to  link  the  information  gained  from  this  with  process  performance  data,  which  is  made  available  by  collaborative  process  automation  systems  cpas.  if  you  want  to  implement  predictive  maintenance  in  your  company  effectively  and  on  a  longterm  basis,  you  should  follow  the  following  three  steps:  a  great  difficulty  in  dealing  with  predictive  maintenance  is  the  processing  of  huge  amounts  of  data.  in  order  to  be  able  to  make  reliable  statements  about  the  condition  of  machines  and  plants  and  thus  to  be  able  to
__label__machineconditionmonitoring detect  malfunctions  as  quickly  as  possible,  it  is  necessary  to  collect  large  amounts  of  data.  these  data  must  be  stored,  processed  and  analyzed  using  intelligent  algorithms.  due  to  the  ,  technologies  and  databases  of  the  environment,  such  as  edge  computing,  are  suitable  for  predictive  maintenance  purposes.  this  data  not  only  includes  the  condition  of  the  machines  and  plants  themselves,  but  also  of  their  environment:  for  instance,  parameters  such  as  temperature  or  humidity  are  also  captured  and  evaluated.  altogether,  the  data  can  differ  very  much  and  is  available  in  different  formats.  due  to  the  large  number  of  different  data  and  formats
__label__machineconditionmonitoring as  well  as  the  large  amount  of  data,  databases  must  have  huge  capacities.  therefore,  it  is  important  to  be  aware  of  the  fact  that  the  size  of  the  database  and  the  intelligence  and  performance  of  the  analysis  algorithm  are  essential  for  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  information  obtained:  the  larger  the  database  and  the  more  intelligent  and  sophisticated  the  algorithm,  the  more  reliable  the  results  will  be.  after  the  data  is  captured,  the  measured  values  and  diagnostic  data  are  transmitted  through  networks  to  service  centers  or  to  the  manufacturer.  the  basis  for  this  process  is  the  .  nevertheless,  it
__label__machineconditionmonitoring is  essential  to  constantly  update  and  process  the  large  amounts  of  data  collected  during  predictive  maintenance  in  order  to  identify  trends  and  developments.  if  predictive  maintenance  is  used  correctly  and  efficiently,  it  can  deliver  a  variety  of  benefits  both  for  the  manufacturer  and  the  user.  these  are  the  most  important  advantages  at  a  glance:  predictive  maintenance  is  already  used  in  many  areas.  it  is  not  only  an  attractive  tool  for  the  manufacturing  industry  in  general,  but  also  for  all  mobility  services  whether  in  aviation,  automotive  or  trains  or  wind  power  plants.  with  the  help  of  predictive  maintenance,  the  downtimes  of
__label__machineconditionmonitoring wind  turbines  can  be  almost  completely  eliminated.  predictive  maintenance  of  motor  vehicles  predictive  maintenance  is  also  gaining  in  importance  in  the  area  of  mobility  for  example  in  the  maintenance  of  motor  vehicles.  extensive  data  collection  acquired  in  the  engine  or  body  of  vehicles,  helps  to  avoid  expensive  repairs  or  breakdowns  at  an  early  stage  because  it  allows  preventive  activities  to  be  initiated.  this  includes,  for  example,  the  replacement  of  a  damaged  vehicle  part  during  the  next  workshop  visit  before  the  part  fails  completely.  predictive  maintenance  goes  one  step  further  if  vehicles  are  networked:  you  can  transmit  data  online  and  automatically
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  service  workshops  or  the  manufacturer.  predictive  maintenance  in  the  aerospace  industry  planes  only  make  money  when  theyre  in  the  air.  if  an  aircraft  breaks  down  due  to  mechanical  damage,  this  leads  to  high  costs  for  the  airline.  therefore,  they  are  keen  on  detecting  possible  damage  in  advance  and  thus  prevent  a  breakdown  or  even  an  accident.  areas  of  application  for  predictive  maintenance  in  aviation  include  turbines  or  hydraulic  pumps.  airbus  launched  its  skywise  data  platform  in  2017,  a  project  that  enables  to  intervene  at  an  early  stage  to  detect  errors  and  replace  a  component  before  it  fails.  predictive  maintenance
__label__machineconditionmonitoring in  rail  transport  the  application  of  predictive  maintenance  in  rail  transport  is  similar.  there,  too,  predictive  maintenance  is  used  to  better  plan  repairs  and  gain  insights  into  the  life  cycle  of  certain  components.  predictive  maintenance  in  rail  transport  can  help  to  prevent  the  unexpected  failure  of  a  train.  it  does  so  by  allowing  to  plan  in  advance  when  the  damaged  part  of  the  train  needs  to  be  repaired  in  order  to  prevent  disruptions  to  operations.  by  analyzing  and  utilizing  the  captured  data,  repair  instructions  can  be  selected,  suitable  spare  parts  can  be  provided,  and  downtimes  can  be  kept  as  short
__label__machineconditionmonitoring as  possible.  predictive  maintenance  differs  from  preventive  maintenance  in  that  it  is  based  on  the  actual  condition  of  a  machine  and  not  on  its  average  or  expected  life  to  predict  when  maintenance  is  required.  preventive  maintenance  is  also  aimed  at  avoiding  downtimes.  the  difference  to  predictive  maintenance,  however,  is  the  fact  that  no  actual  data  collected  from  the  machine  is  used  for  maintenance,  but  that  maintenance  measures  and  monitoring  are  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  regular  intervals  already  defined  in  advance.  preventive  maintenance  is  based  on  the  theoretical  failure  rate  and  therefore  disregards  the  actual  machine  performance.  downtime  is
__label__machineconditionmonitoring planned  on  the  basis  of  calendar  dates  or  usage.  care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  maintenance  time  is  neither  too  early  nor  too  late.  for  example,  most  forklift  truck  manufacturers  recommend  preventive  maintenance  every  150  to  200  hours  of  operation.  since  companies,  their  plants  and  their  daily  operations  can  differ  greatly,  the  use  of  preventive  maintenance  can  lead  to  unnecessary  maintenance  work.  in  addition,  when  using  preventive  maintenance,  a  company  quickly  runs  the  risk  of  replacing  parts  at  an  early  stage  that  still  function  perfectly  and  would  still  have  done  so.  this  article  was  first  published  by  .

__label__machineconditionmonitoring one  of  the  most  important  trends  in  the  last  few  decades  has  been  the  movement  toward  lean  manufacturing.  as  companies  began  to  review  and  change  their  operating  procedures  to  eliminate  waste,  efficiency  reached  new  heights  across  most  industries  when  it  was  deployed.  but  while  lean  remains  a  valuable  tool  for  improving  and  maintaining  efficiency,  there  comes  a  point  in  any  lean  program  where  additional  kaizen  events  yield  smaller  and  smaller  results  in  terms  of  bottom  line  value  because  waste  has  been  largely  eliminated  throughout  the  manufacturing  system.  in  these  instances,  it  is  possible  that  the  ability  to  further  improve  efficiency
__label__machineconditionmonitoring and  lower  cost  in  the  system  is  inhibited.  either  lean  initiatives  have  removed  so  much  waste  that  the  level  of  control  and  manipulation  of  system  processes  for  further  gains  requires  a  high  degree  of  automation  and  analytics.  or,  the  lean  system  as  applied  to  a  complex  manufactured  product  has  removed  so  much  waste  that  the  drill  down  to  additional  gains  is  exceedingly  complex.  in  both  cases,  the  possibility  for  additional  improvements  and  gains  has  reached  a  point  where  it  ,intuitive  human  analysis  and  gutfeel.  as  industry  4.0  and  the  industrial  internet  of  things  iiot  has  gained  steam  over  the  last
__label__machineconditionmonitoring few  years,  many  people  are  realizing  that  to  continue  adding  additional  efficiencies  and  process  improvements,  data  capture,  analytics  and  connected  devices  will  be  required  to  move  forward.  many  even  view  iiot  as  the  next  logical  step  in  lean,  as  a  move  toward  digital  lean  in  manufacturing.  but  in  traditional  lean,  processes  are  reviewed  and  improved  by  department  or  functional  area  and  can  be  episodic  or  insular  as  a  result.  one  key  advantage  that  iiot,  big  data  and  advanced  analytics  has  is  that  it  can  provide  systemic  interoperability  between  departments  that  support  manufacturing  and  in  doing  so,  improvements  accrue  to  manufacturing
__label__machineconditionmonitoring in  the  form  of  cost  improvement  and  added  efficiency.  in  addition,  the  two  support  areas  where  this  is  most  applicable  are  supply  chain  and  equipment  maintenance.  most  modern  manufacturing  has  built  maintenance  efforts  around  preventive  maintenance.  in  preventive  maintenance,  equipment  is  maintained  on  a  using  inspections,  calibrations,  repairs  and  other  regular  service  checks  to  reduce  the  chances  of  failure  in  the  future.  it  has  been  an  important  tool  and  a  critical  part  of  both  lean  and  nonlean  manufacturing  for  many  years,  allowing  some  predictability  compared  to  repair  as  you  go  maintenance  schemes.  but  just  as  improvement  methods  have  reached  a
__label__machineconditionmonitoring barrier  where  human  intervention  can  no  longer  drive  improvements,  so  too  has  preventive  maintenance  reached  an  impasse  as  well.  for  one,  preventive  maintenance  is  based  on  statistical  modeling  and  broad  averages  to  suggest  when  maintenance  should  be  undertaken.  because  maintenance  is  done  whether  it  is  needed  or  not,  it  is  ineffective  in  identifying  problems  between  maintenance  cycles.  these  statistical  models  are  most  often  developed  by  the  oems  that  supply  the  equipment.  and  while  there  may  be  some  subdivision  of  suggested  preventive  maintenance  available  based  on  experience  of  the  oem,  preventive  maintenance  does  not  answer  real  world  and  real  time  situations.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring in  real  world  applications,  true  maintenance  requirements  may  be  based  on  many  different  variables.  the  result  in  differences  in  factory  environments  such  as  ambient  conditions  like  temperature  and  humidity,  or  in  cases  where  a  manufacturer  may  use  to  manufacture  its  products  whereas  other  manufacturers  using  the  same  equipment  may  use  light  or  nonabusive  materials,  means  the  true  maintenance  requirements  will  vary  greatly.  a  second  shortcoming  of  preventive  maintenance  and  its  reliance  on  probability  rather  than  actuality  is  that  at  its  best,  predictive  maintenance  can  only  mitigate  probability  impact  and  the  chance  that  something  might  happen.  it  is  incapable  of  predicting
__label__machineconditionmonitoring what  will  happen  or  what  is  happening  now.  this  inhibits  maintenance  managers  and  other  decision  makers  from  being  able  to  manage  maintenance  efforts  to  optimize  a  program  in  support  of  improved  efficiency  and  cost  savings.  as  a  result,  preventive  maintenance  is  labor  intensive  and  reactive.  to  realize  additional  improvements  and  fully  optimize  the  system,  iiot  offers  a  way  forward  with  predictive  rather  than  preventive  maintenance.  also  known  as  conditions  based  maintenance  cbm,  predictive  maintenance  relies  on  installed  or  embedded  devices  to  monitor  a  machines  actual  condition.  through  use  of  machine  learning  and  advanced  analytics  and  ai,  maintenance  strategies  can  be
__label__machineconditionmonitoring developed  that  deploy  maintenance  resources  only  when  sensors  or  monitors  show  signs  of  impending  failure.  depending  on  the  type  of  equipment  and  device,  in  many  cases  adjustments  can  be  automated  for  minor  adjustments  during  run  time  until  full  repair  can  be  made  on  the  next  scheduled  downtime  cycle.  decisions  and  actions  are  based  on  realtime  data  to  identify  problems  proactively  and  is  also  conducted  when  maintenance  or  tech  involvement  is  most  cost  effective  such  as  changeovers,  or  scheduled  downtime.  by  utilizing  iiot  technology  to  deploy  predictive  maintenance,  strong  gains  can  be  made  that  both  reduce  costs  and  allow  manufacturing  to
__label__machineconditionmonitoring achieve  higher  efficiencies  than  those  possible  with  traditional  preventive  maintenance.  studies  show  that  when  used,  predictive  maintenance  programs  can  by  25.  further,  downtime  can  drop  as  much  as  75  and  overall  maintenance  costs  can  be  reduced  by  25  as  well.  areas  where  these  gains  can  be  measured  include:  prediction  and  prevention  service  providers  in  iiot  also  have  robust  analytics  that  can  be  applied  to  automate  many  adjustments  when  equipment  allows.  in  other  instances,  automatic  alerts  can  be  sent  to  maintenance  staff  to  alert  the  need  for  a  repair  during  an  upcoming  changeover  cycle  if  the  failure  is  not  imminent.  this
__label__machineconditionmonitoring level  of  prediction  and  intervention  reduces  wasted  labor  that  has  accompanied  traditional  maintenance  schemes.  optimized  maintenance  routines  with  predictive  maintenance,  staff  maintenance  routines  can  be  optimized.  using  data  and  software  repair  parts,  supplies  and  consumables  can  even  be  ordered,  inventory  relieved  and  material  staged  in  advance  of  the  scheduled  repair.  this  can  be  taken  down  to  the  tool  level  so  that  the  technician  carries  only  what  they  need  for  the  repair  saving  time  and  reducing  strain.  one  key  gain  in  an  is  that  by  using  sensors  to  monitor  the  failure  and  pinpoint  its  cause  and  location  within  the  machine,  guesswork

__label__machineconditionmonitoring equipment  age,  heavy  or  light  product  mix,  inherent  ambient  conditions  and  a  host  of  other  variables  that  would  not  be  possible  to  account  for  in  human  based  analysis.  studies  have  shown  that  in  traditional  preventive  maintenance  programs,  of  every  dollar  spent  is  wasted.  through  lack  of  analytical  capability  and  reliance  upon  statistical  modeling,  these  programs  build  waste  into  the  system.  further,  additional  data  exists  that  show  in  most  manufacturing  preventive  maintenance  programs,  have  agerelated  failure  patterns  which  make  the  program  efforts  highly  inefficient.  by  using  the  same  iot  devices,  data  and  software  used  to  drive  production  and  supply  chain  improvements,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring manufacturing  maintenance  can  develop  comprehensive  strategies  to  address  all  the  failings  above.  iiot  service  providers  offer  robust  analytics  as  well  as  device  sourcing,  installation  and  service.  this  allows  a  maintenance  program  to  contribute  to  optimized  uptime  and  asset  longevity  in  direct  support  of  core  production  and  efficiency  gain.  with  iiot  the  available  data  is  so  large  that  these  gains  could  not  be  realized  using  traditional  human  decision  making.  but  with  the  use  of  advanced  analytics,  ai,  machine  learning  and  device  deployment,  manufacturing  companies  can  realize  these  gains  and  take  the  next  step  in  the  evolution  of  lean  to  create  a

__label__machineconditionmonitoring story.  by  implementing  cfs  across  their  international  operations  the  company  has  seen  a  78  increase  in  the  number  of  service  events  which  can  be  diagnosed  and  corrected  remotely,  with  no  need  to  despatch  a  field  technician.  shutterstock  now  they  have  the  window  into  what  might  be  happening  they  are  able  to  better  diagnose  issues  remotely,  and  send  out  a  software  patch  or  a  fix  without  having  to  roll  out  a  truck  to  fix  it,  says  krishna.  in  fact,  according  to  servicemaxs  report  on  its  first  year  performance,  customers  have  reported  benefits  after  switching  to  a  connected  strategy  across  productivity,  efficiency,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring growth,  revenue,  customer  experience  and  compliance.  this  potential  for  a  move  towards  a  predictive  or  proactive  maintenance  and  service  paradigm  is  one  of  the  most  enticing  promises  made  by  modern  analytics  and  data  capture  technologies,  to  the  manufacturing  and  servicing  industries.  not  every  organization  can  be  ready  to  make  the  jump  right  away  a  thorough  understanding  of  how  data  affects  a  business,  from  the  ground  up,  is  necessary  first  but  taking  small  steps  to  improve  measures  incrementally  is  often  a  useful  tactic  for  building  a  connected  strategy,  says  krishna,  and  once  this  is  done  then  ideas  like  predictive  maintenance  become
__label__machineconditionmonitoring a  viable  possibility.  in  many  cases  if  you  look  at  the  state  of  the  service  industry,  there  are  a  lot  of  laggers.  you  still  run  into  companies  which  have  dozens  if  not  hundreds  of  technicians  and  the  organization  is  still  essentially  being  run  on  pen,  paper  and  fax.  making  a  leap  from  there  to  a  connected  strategy  is  a  big  leap  so  companies  take  multiple  shots  to  get  to  a  modernized,  centralized  platform  where  youre  automating  workflows  and  capturing  all  the  information  digitally.  another  efficiency  achieved  by  medivators  is  a  reduction  in  the  average  time  taken  for  a  technician  to

__label__machineconditionmonitoring definition:  the  goal  of  predictive  maintenance  is  to  forecast  prevent  equipment  failure  too  generic?  lets  try  and  put  it  in  the  context  of  two  classic  maintenance  methods:  maintenance  is  simple:  if  its  not  broken,  dont  fix  it.  its  best  for  cases  where  equipment  failure  is  rare,  easy  to  fix  and  with  limited  impact  e.g.  switching  a  lightbulb  in  a  warehouse  maintenance  or  preventive  maintenance  uses  routine  maintenance  to  diagnose  equipment  for  failure.  it  works  and  is  widely  employed  but  its  costly  and  doesnt  capture  assetspecific  conditions  maintenance  leverages  data  from  an  individual  assets  to  predict  failure.  this  way,  repairs  can
__label__machineconditionmonitoring be  done  when  needed  and  avoided  when  not.  it  offers  the  best  upside,  but  at  the  cost  of  complexity  of  course,  predictive  maintenance  can  be  further  split  into  sub  sections  see  details  below:  in  principle,  predictive  maintenance  has  been  around  for  ages:  when  a  technician  inspects  an  asset  and  makes  a  change  to  avoid  future  failure,  thats  predictive  maintenance.  the  difference  is  the  amount  of  data  that  is  used  and  the  frequency  of  updates  cf.  the  overview  of  pdm  1.04.0.  below,  we  focus  mainly  on  predictive  maintenance  4.0,  using  iot,  big  data  and  predictive  analytics  in  near  realtime.  in  particular,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring well  dive  into  the  sub  sections  of  pdm  4.0  to  show  that  this  is  still  an  extremely  broad  segmentation.  cmms  is  closely  linked  to  predictive  maintenance.  while  data  is  collected  via  iot  and  iiot  industrial  iot  devices,  it  naturally  requires  software  to  process  the  data.  here,  a  large  number  of  platforms  exist,  though  the  core  principle  is  the  same.  effective  cmms  tools  effectively  manage  the  potentially  massive  amounts  of  iot  data,  cleans  it  and  processes  it  as  part  of  predictive  models.  further,  the  cmms  solution  typically  needs  to  enable  eventbased  reaction  patterns  e.g.  informing  technicians  of  upcoming  issues  via  e.g.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring sms  or  display  warnings.  below  well  touch  briefly  on  some  of  these  aspects,  though  well  not  dive  into  specific  cmms  systems  or  solutions.  on  the  surface,  predictive  maintenance  is  kind  of  simple.  yet,  in  a  of  280  companies  pwc  found  that  only  11  have  reached  pdm  4.0  maturity  i.e.  using  big  data  to  do  predictive  analytics  though  47  plan  to  implement  it  in  the  future.  thats  a  big  disconnect  lets  explore  this  below.  you  can  look  at  predictive  maintenance  as  a  as  illustrated  below:  :  first,  youll  need  to  gather  relevant  data  that  can  help  you  predict  timetofailure.  this  is
__label__machineconditionmonitoring often  done  by  e.g.  adding  vibration  iot  sensors  to  get  indirect  data.  however,  a  far  more  direct  method  is  to  tap  into  the  runtime  data  the  machine  uses  to  operate.  all  vehicles  and  most  industrial  machinery  operate  using  a  combination  of  transducers  sensors  and  actuators  and  control  units.  the  control  units  implement  algorithms  that  determine  the  behavior  of  the  machine.  the  runtime  data  is  continuously  transported,  often  using  wires  and  communication  protocols.  one  very  popular  transportation  method  is  ,  whihch  is  e.g.  standard  in  all  vehicles.  if  a  vehicle  or  machine  uses  can  bus  wires  for  data  transportation,  its  often
__label__machineconditionmonitoring possible  to  safely  tap  directly  into  the  runtime  data  stream.  this  can  be  done  using  an  ,  which  opens  up  the  full  scope  of  your  asset  operational  data.  your  can  logger  can  then  transfer  this  data  to  the  cloud  via  a  wifi  hotspot  wlan,  3g,  4g  in  near  realtime.  :  the  collected  data  is  processed  in  the  cloud.  for  can  bus  data,  this  includes  transforming  the  data  to  .  once  ready,  the  data  can  be  used  in  a  predictive  model.  these  range  from  simplistic  singlevariable  thresholds  to  advanced  machine  learning  algorithms.  more  on  this  below.  :  the  model  provides  estimates
__label__machineconditionmonitoring of  e.g.  the  timetofailure  for  an  asset  and  its  components.  from  here,  its  simply  reacting  on  the  insight:  autoschedule  maintenance,  send  push  notifications  to  warn  staff  of  potential  breakdowns  and  optimize  your  spare  part  inventory.  do  you  feel  the  step  is  a  bit  fuzzy?  youre  not  alone  below  we  try  and  flesh  this  out  with  some  very  basic  illustrative  examples:  in  this  we  consider  a  vehicle  where  the  only  possible  failure  is  from  not  refilling  the  oil.  over  time,  the  oil  level  decreases  to  10  and  the  vehicle  breaks  down  its  remaining  useful  life  rul  is  zero.  in  the  example,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring we  pretend  that  we  observe  the  true  rul  and  adapt  a  simple  linear  regression.  with  this  we  predict  the  rul  outofsample  and  decide  a  time  for  warning  which  in  the  example  is  17  off  vs.  the  true  rul.  the  point  here  is  merely  to  show  the  concept  in  a  simple  way  we  strongly  recommend  reading  by  ben  everson.  in  short,  he  takes  outset  in  nasas  2008  ,  which  contains  training  test  data  on  10  engines  equipped  with  20  sensors.  the  goal  is  similar  to  example  1,  but  in  a  more  realistic  context.  in  particular,  this  is  helpful  if  youre  about
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  get  started  with  the  basic  data  cleaning  statistical  considerations.  check  out  both  his  and  the  above  examples  illustrate  that  adding  more  data  quickly  adds  complexity.  for  this  reason,  .  machine  learning  is  a  natural  fit  as  pdm  involves  failure  classification  using  huge  amounts  of  sensor  data.  we  wont  dive  deeper  into  pdm  using  machine  learning  here,  but  consider  reading  this  or  this  using  the  nasa  turbofan  data  with  ml.  further,  if  youre  interested  in  a  bit  more  detail  on  the  predictive  models  for  pdm,  check  out  by  bigdata  republic  its  a  great  read,  in  particular  to  provide  context  for
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  rul  modelling  strategy  in  our  examples  1  and  2  above.  well  detail  how  to  get  started  further  below  but  first  well  look  at  the  potential  benefits  of  pdm:  if  you  succeed  with  pdm,  it  can  be  with  examples  of  including:  source  1:  source  2:  source  3:  below  we  detail  some  of  the  :  if  theres  one  thing  your  customers  hate,  its  poor  delivery  accuracy.  by  employing  pdm,  you  can  drastically  reduce  unexpected  breakdowns  in  your  vehicle  fleet  or  site  machinery.  with  demanding  players  like  amazon,  this  can  be  a  strategic  makeorbreak  for  many  big  manufacturers.  by  fixing  issues  before
__label__machineconditionmonitoring they  lead  to  breakdowns,  youll  immediately  reduce  downtime.  further,  a  can  bus  pdm  system  provides  your  technicians  with  extensive  assetspecific  data.  this  way,  theyll  know  the  issue  beforehand  letting  them  skip  generic  checklists  and  cut  downtime  dramatically  preventive  maintenance  is  costly  as  it  relies  on  e.g.  time  based  intervals.  these  are  weak  predictors  of  failure,  hence  conservatively  frequent  checkins  are  needed.  with  pdm,  the  assetspecific  big  data  is  far  more  precise  in  predicting  an  issue  enabling  far  less  frequent  maintenance  with  reactive  or  preventive  maintenance,  a  massive  inventory  of  spare  parts  is  necessary  you  dont  know  what  youll  need  until
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  asset  is  taken  out  of  operation.  with  pdm,  youll  estimate  timetofailure  for  each  sub  component  via  the  cloud,  allowing  a  far  more  lean  inventory  by  setting  up  pdm  for  e.g.  a  vehicle  fleet,  you  can  track  the  remaining  life  of  each  vehicle  component.  this  lets  you  truly  optimize  total  cost  of  ownership  tco,  by  deciding  the  optimal  replacement  timing  taking  into  account  replacement  costs  vs.  impacts  on  fuel  costs  and  vehicle  life  in  worst  case,  breakdowns  of  machinery  or  vehicles  can  lead  to  catastrophic  events  and  harm  workers.  by  predicting  issues  before  they  escalate,  youll  be  able  to  reduce
__label__machineconditionmonitoring accidents  and  boost  team  morale  finally,  basing  your  pdm  on  direct  data  is  far  more  powerful  than  e.g.  using  vibration  sensors.  with  can  bus  data,  youll  practically  have  a  digital  copy  of  your  asset  in  the  cloud  opening  up  tons  of  new  applications:  productivity  optimization,  remote  troubleshooting,  realtime  kpi  dashboards  and  more.  in  turn,  this  improves  the  returnoninvestment  roi  on  your  implementation.  the  benefits  can  be  harvested  by  both  end  users  e.g.  site  or  fleet  managers  and  original  equipment  manufacturers  oems.  furter,  pdm  is  highly  relevant  across  both  trucks,  buses,  defense  vehicles,  agricultural  equipment,  industrial  production  machinery,  and  many  more
__label__machineconditionmonitoring industries.  in  short:  but  of  course  its  not  that  easy  in  particular,  :  pdm  is  unknown  territory  to  most  corporate  leaders.  will  this  work?,  does  it  kill  our  budget?  get  buyin  or  the  market  is  complex  and  finding  a  good  fit  is  hard.  if  youre  just  getting  started  with  pdm,  avoid  an  expensive  enterprise  solution.  processing  big  data  can  be  difficult.  set  the  right  team  and  begin  with  few  parameters.  but:  historical  data  is  vital  so  most  iot  solutions  lock  your  data  in  the  their  cloud.  however,  this  data  and  the  capabilities  learned  may  become  your  top  differentiators.  the  model
__label__machineconditionmonitoring should  match  your  capabilities.  dont  choose  a  big  outsourced  model  you  dont  understand  if  its  not  a  fit.  the  challenges  are  significant  and  implementing  pdm  requires  the  right  approach.  we  explore  this  in  our  next  section  back  to  the  question:  from  our  experience,  the  answer  is  pretty  simple:  pdm  gets  plenty  of  hype  even  at  the  top  but  dies  because  nobody  get  started.  so  how  do  you  do  it?  the  key  is  to  do  a  small,  simple  and  low  cost  that  scales  easily  when  you  bring  the  poc  to  your  management  team,  you  drastically  reduce  the  need  for  them  to

__label__machineconditionmonitoring connecting  the  smarts  in  todays  competitive  industrial  world,  predictive  maintenance  pdm  is  no  longer  a  nicetohave;  it  has  become  a  necessity.  traditional  pdm  methods  have  several  limitations.  however  advancements  in  wireless,  cloud  and  ai  technology  are  disrupting  the  way  pdm  has  been  done  in  recent  decades.  companies  are  making  use  of  these  technologies  to  offer  an  endtoend,  easytodeploy  pdm  solution  at  extremely  affordable  price  points.  this  trend  is  called  the  industrial  internet  of  things  iiot.  according  to  arc  and  others,  predictive  maintenance  is  currently  the  biggest  use  case  for  iot  across  all  sectors.  this  article  compares  and  contrasts  the  traditional
__label__machineconditionmonitoring models  with  the  modern  iotbased  pdm  approach.  traditionally,  most  factories  have  adopted  either  a  reactive  runtofailure  or  a  preventive  maintenance  pm  model  because  of  the  high  costs  of  predictive  maintenance.  in  a  reactive  model,  a  machine  is  repaired  or  replaced  only  in  the  event  of  a  failure.  this  leads  to  unplanned  downtime  and  significant  repair  costs.  ideally  runtofailure  is  recommendedfor  the  least  critical  assets  which  have  very  little  impact  on  operations.  under  a  preventive  maintenance  approach,  maintenance  teams  create  predefined  repair  schedules  without  considering  the  actual  condition  of  the  machine.  work  order  schedules  are  often  based  on  manufacturers  recommendations.  these
__label__machineconditionmonitoring schedules  can  be  unreliable  because  the  actual  operating  condition  of  the  machine  may  be  different  from  the  recommended  operating  condition.  also,  improper  pm  can  lead  to  unintended  malfunction.  in  either  of  these  approaches,  the  focus  is  not  on  assessing  and  predicting  machine  condition.  predictive  maintenance  is  referred  to  the  maintenance  approach  of  understanding  the  underlying  health  of  a  machine  to  determine  if  a  corrective  action  is  required.  to  determine  the  health  of  the  machines,  sensors  are  used  to  measure  various  machine  parameters  such  as  vibration,  temperature  and  ultrasound.  in  continuous  monitoring,  wired  sensors  are  installed  on  the  machines  are  connected
__label__machineconditionmonitoring back  to  the  asset  management  software.  however,  this  is  a  very  expensive  solution  and  is  often  reserved  for  the  small  percentage  of  the  most  critical  machines.  for  the  balance  of  plant  equipment,  predictive  maintenance  has  typically  been  conducted  using  a  walk  around  program.  a  technician  goes  around  the  plant  periodically  and  collects  sensor  data  using  a  data  collector.  however,  this  traditional  approach  of  once  a  month  data  collection  is  not  truly  predictive  as  it  comes  with  several  limitations.  here  are  the  main  reasons  why  a  walk  around  program  does  not  constitute  a  truly  predictive  maintenance  solution.  up  until  recently,  most
__label__machineconditionmonitoring industries  relied  on  walk  around  programs  because  continuous  monitoring  was  extremely  expensive.  but  not  anymore  industrial  iot  is  making  the  transformation  to  continuous  conditionbased  monitoring  and  predictive  maintenance  incredibly  easy  and  affordable.  there  are  four  key  trends  driving  this  change:  while  in  isolation  each  of  these  technologies  bring  some  value,  when  combined  together  into  a  single  solution,  they  have  the  power  to  transform  the  industrial  world.  modern  solutions  involve  wireless  sensors  that  continuously  collect  sensor  data.  the  sensors  keep  a  close  watch  on  the  key  parameters  of  the  machine  such  as  vibrations  or  temperature.  periodically,  or  when  a  threshold  is
__label__machineconditionmonitoring exceeded,  the  sensors  wirelessly  send  the  data  to  the  cloud  through  a  wireless  gateway  such  as  wifi,  bluetooth  or  various  other  wireless  technologies  available  on  the  market.  once  the  data  reaches  the  cloud,  it  is  processed  to  extract  the  key  parameters  that  are  necessary  to  determine  machine  health.  users  can  view  the  trending  of  these  critical  parameters  and  set  thresholds  on  a  web  or  mobile  dashboard.  infographic  courtesy  of  petasense  the  more  sophisticated  solutions  go  further  by  including  an  analytics  module  that  can  analyze  all  of  the  sensor  data  in  real  time  and  automatically.  given  all  the  recent  advancements  in
__label__machineconditionmonitoring ai  such  as  deep  learning  and  use  of  gpu  chips,  aibased  analytics  are  able  to  detect  machine  anomalies,  do  diagnosis  and  provide  prognosis.  future  advancements  in  this  space  involves  combining  multiple  sensor  parameters  alongside  historical  work  order  information.  and  all  of  this  is  happening  in  real  time  the  future  holds  the  promise  of  completely  automating  predictive  maintenance.  no  more  manual  data  collection,  no  requirement  to  be  onsite  near  the  machine.  and  with  ai  technology,  it  really  helps  scale  the  job  of  a  machine  expert.  ai  can  keep  a  close  watch  on  all  machines  and  flag  the  problems  ones.  an  expert
__label__machineconditionmonitoring needs  to  only  review  the  health  of  the  machines  exhibiting  anomalies.  ai  completely  replaces  the  need  for  setting  up  and  maintaining  manual  alarms.  these  alarms  are  hard  to  set  accurately  and  as  a  result  users  end  up  losing  confidence  in  a  system.  but  with  ai,  alarms  are  data  driven  data  that  is  hard  for  humans  to  process  but  easy  for  computers  to  digest.  historically,  adopting  advanced  technology  involved  a  huge  upfront  capex  investment  which  often  resulted  in  limited  adoption  of  the  technology.  however,  with  the  advent  of  these  new  technologies,  thats  no  longer  the  case.  sensors  and  software  are  becoming
__label__machineconditionmonitoring increasingly  inexpensive.  further,  industries  can  start  small  by  monitoring  a  few  critical  machines  and  then  scale  to  the  entire  facility  gradually.  most  importantly,  all  this  cool  technology  translates  to  tangible  benefits.  industrial  plants  are  able  to  eliminate  unplanned  downtime,lower  preventive  maintenance  costs  and  reduce  unanticipated  repair  costs.  everything  from  the  food  we  eat  to  the  fuel  that  powers  our  cars,  from  the  medicines  we  consume  to  the  electricity  that  lights  our  homes  is  powered  by  factories.  these  factories  have  millions  of  machines  that  turn,  churn,  mix,  grind,  and  transport  things.  wireless  predictive  maintenance  with  aibased  analytics  make  it  possible  to
__label__machineconditionmonitoring monitor,  analyze  and  predict  the  health  of  these  machines  that  are  driving  our  everyday  lives.  we  see  a  future  where  preventive  maintenance  is  entirely  replaced  by  predictive  maintenance.  repairs  or  corrective  action  are  only  required  when  predictive  technologies  indicate  failinghealth  of  machines.  with  clear  advantages  over  traditional  approaches,  wireless  predictive  maintenance  is  poised  to  transform  maintenance  forever.  the  article  was  written  byabhinav  khushraj,  the  cofounder  and  ceo  of  .  he  brings  over  a  decade  of  experience  in  building  businesses  at  larger  corporations  like  citrix  and  nokia.  he  has  also  founded  two  other  technology  startups  in  the  past.  khushraj  has  a
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  interest  in  machine  learning  for  on  the  edge  is  growing.  manufacturers  need  to  know  when  a  machine  is  about  to  fail  so  they  can  better  plan  for  maintenance.  for  example,  as  a  manufacturer,  you  might  have  a  machine  that  is  sensitive  to  various  temperature,  velocity,  or  pressure  changes.  when  these  changes  occur,  they  might  indicate  a  failure.  prediction,  sometimes  referred  to  as  inference,  requires  machinelearning  ml  models  based  on  large  amounts  of  data  for  each  component  of  the  system.  the  model  is  based  on  a  specified  algorithm  that  represents  the  relationships  between  the  values  in  the  training  data.  you
__label__machineconditionmonitoring use  these  ml  models  to  evaluate  new  data  from  the  manufacturing  system  in  near  realtime.  a  predicted  failure  exists  when  the  evaluation  of  the  new  data  with  the  ml  model  indicates  there  is  a  statistical  match  with  a  piece  of  equipment  in  the  system.  typically,  an  ml  model  is  built  for  each  type  of  machine  or  subprocess  using  its  unique  data  and  features.  this  leads  to  an  expansive  set  of  ml  models  that  represents  each  of  the  critical  machines  in  the  manufacturing  process  and  different  types  of  predictions  desired.  although  the  ml  model  supports  inference  of  new  data  sent  to
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  aws  cloud,  you  can  also  perform  the  inference  on  premises,  where  latency  is  much  lower.  this  results  in  a  more  realtime  evaluation  of  the  data.  performing  local  inference  also  saves  costs  related  to  the  transfer  of  what  could  be  massive  amounts  of  data  to  the  cloud.  the  aws  services  used  to  build  and  train  ml  models  for  automated  deployment  to  the  edge  make  the  process  highly  scalable  and  easy  to  do.  you  collect  data  from  the  machines  or  infrastructure  that  you  want  to  make  predictions  on  and  build  ml  models  using  aws  services  in  the  cloud.  then  you  transfer
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  ml  models  back  to  the  onpremises  location  where  they  are  used  with  a  simple  function  to  evaluate  new  data  sent  to  a  local  server  running  .  aws  greengrass  lets  you  run  local  compute,  messaging,  ml  inference,  and  more.  it  includes  a  lightweight  iot  broker  that  you  run  on  your  own  hardware  close  to  the  connected  equipment.  the  broker  communicates  securely  with  many  iot  devices  and  is  a  gateway  to  where  selected  data  can  be  further  processed.  aws  greengrass  can  also  execute  aws  lambda  functions  to  process  or  evaluate  data  locally  without  an  ongoing  need  to  connect  to  the  cloud.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring you  need  to  build  and  train  ml  models  before  you  start  maintenance  predictions.  a  highlevel  ml  process  to  build  and  train  models  applies  to  most  use  cases  and  is  relatively  easy  to  implement  with  aws  iot.  start  by  collecting  supporting  data  for  the  ml  problem  that  you  are  trying  to  solve  and  temporarily  send  it  to  aws  iot  core.  this  data  should  be  from  the  machine  or  system  associated  with  each  ml  model.  a  dedicated  connection  between  the  onpremises  location  of  the  machines  and  aws  iot  core  supports  highvolume  data  rates.  depending  on  the  volume  of  data  you  are  sending
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  the  cloud,  you  might  need  to  stagger  the  data  collection  for  your  machines  that  is,  work  in  batches.  alternatively,  an  appliance  can  transfer  large  amounts  of  data  to  your  private  aws  account  using  a  secure  hardened  storage  device  you  ship  with  a  package  delivery  service.  the  data  is  transferred  from  aws  snowball  to  amazon  s3  buckets  you  designate  in  your  account.  supports  the  efficient  storage  of  data  and  pipeline  processing  to  enrich  and  filter  the  data  for  later  use  in  ml  model  building.  it  also  supports  feature  engineering  in  the  pipeline  processing  with  custom  functions  that  you  can  write
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  derive  new  attributes  to  help  classify  the  data.  you  can  visualize  the  results  of  the  pipeline  processing  in  aws  iot  analytics  using  to  validate  any  transformations  or  filters  you  apply.  supports  direct  integration  with  as  a  data  source.  jupyter  notebook  templates  are  provided  to  get  you  started  quickly  in  building  and  training  the  ml  model.  for  predictive  maintenance  use  cases,  linear  regression  and  classification  are  the  two  most  common  algorithms  you  can  use.  there  are  many  other  algorithms  to  consider  for  timeseries  data  prediction  and  you  can  try  different  ones  and  measure  the  effectiveness  of  each  in  your  process.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring also  consider  that  supports  that  make  deployment  easier.  either  of  these  ml  frameworks  simplify  the  deployment  process  to  aws  greengrass,  but  you  can  use  others  with  additional  setup.  for  example,  you  could  use  the  popular  python  library  to  analyze  data.  many  users  like  the  elasticity  of  the  aws  cloud  combined  with  its  payforwhatyouuse  pricing  structure.  when  ml  models  are  built  and  trained  or  later  retrained,  large  amounts  of  raw  data  are  sent  to  aws  iot  core.  in  addition,  you  need  large  amounts  of  compute  to  speed  the  processing  along  using  amazon  sagemaker.  when  the  ml  models  are  complete,  you  can
__label__machineconditionmonitoring archive  the  raw  data  to  a  lower  cost  storage  service  with  amazon  glacier  or  delete  it.  the  compute  resources  allocated  for  the  training  are  also  released  and  costs  decrease.  running  predictions  locally  requires  the  realtime  machine  data,  ml  model,  and  local  compute  resources  to  perform  the  inference.  built  with  amazon  sagemaker  to  the  edge.  an  aws  lambda  function  performs  the  inference.  identical  machines  can  receive  the  same  deployment  package  that  contains  the  ml  model  and  inference  lambda  function.  this  creates  a  lowlatency  solution.  there  is  no  dependency  on  aws  iot  core  to  evaluate  realtime  data  and  send  alerts  or  commands
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  infrastructure  to  shut  down,  if  required.  the  aws  lambda  function  linked  to  the  ml  model  as  part  of  the  aws  greengrass  deployment  configuration  performs  predictions  in  real  time.  the  aws  greengrass  message  broker  routes  selected  data  published  on  a  designated  mqtt  topic  to  the  aws  lambda  function  to  perform  the  inference.  when  an  inference  returns  a  high  probability  of  a  match,  then  multiple  actions  can  be  executed  in  the  aws  lambda  function.  for  example,  a  shutdown  command  can  be  sent  to  a  machine  or,  using  either  local  or  cloud  messaging  services,  an  alert  can  be  sent  to  an  operations
__label__machineconditionmonitoring team.  for  each  ml  model,  you  need  to  determine  the  threshold  for  inference  confidence  that  equates  to  a  predicted  failure  condition.  for  example,  if  an  inference  for  a  machine  you  are  monitoring  indicates  with  high  confidence  lets  say  a  level  of  90,  then  you  would  take  appropriate  action.  however,  if  the  confidence  level  is  30,  then  you  might  decide  not  to  act  on  that  result.  you  can  use  using  aws  iot  core  to  publish  inference  results  on  a  dedicated  logging  and  reporting  topic.  another  consideration  for  running  inference  locally  is  ensuring  you  have  a  large  enough  server  or  multiple  servers
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  support  the  amount  of  compute  required.  factors  that  influence  hardware  sizing  include:  the  endtoend  architecture  includes:  aws  greengrass  supports  accessing  local  resources  and  aws  iot  core  to  help  keep  your  manufacturing  process  up  and  running.  environmental  monitoring  solutions  specializes  in  solutions  that  help  petrol  retailers  gather  and  analyze  data  on  the  performance  of  their  petrol  stations.  by  using  aws  iot  to  detect  fuel  leaks  early  to  minimize  environmental  impact,  the  company  received  a  500  roi.  aws  iot  made  it  possible  to  connect  sensors  in  the  underground  tanks  and  pumps  of  each  petrol  station  and  collect  all  data  at  30second

__label__machineconditionmonitoring maintenance  is  a  challenging  task:  you  must  ensure  machine  availability  and  minimize  resource  consumption  for  repairs  while  keeping  an  eye  on  the  quality  of  the  product.  in  the  past,  it  was  difficult  to  take  all  these  factors  into  account.  however,  the  arrival  of  industry  4.0  has  created  a  new  opportunity  for  predictive  maintenance.  involves  collecting  and  evaluating  data  from  your  machines  to  not  only  can  you  gage  the  condition  of  your  equipment,  but  also  more  accurately  predict  when  maintenance  work  is  needed.  spindles  in  milling  machines  are  prone  to  breaking  during  the  production  process.  whats  more,  repairing  spindles  can  be
__label__machineconditionmonitoring very  expensive.  therefore,  being  able  to  predict  damage  and  precisely  when  the  spindle  will  break  can  greatly  reduce  costs.  to  overcome  this  challenge,  special  sensors  e.g.  ultrasonic  or  vibration  sensors  identify  the  patterns  of  a  fragile  spindle.  relevant  alert  settings  for  the  current  state  of  the  machine  can  then  be  created.  the  sensors  generate  data  which  is  then  compared  to  the  information  from  the  machine  and  the  specific  workpiece  being  processed.  by  analyzing  the  data,  it  is  possible  to  identify  patterns  of  behavior  that  more  accurately  predict  when  the  spindle  is  about  to  break.  this  enables  maintenance  schedules  to  be
__label__machineconditionmonitoring planned  accordingly.  deposits  in  the  conduits  can  cause  heat  exchangers  to  clog.  a  further  complicating  factor  is  the  fact  that  it  is  impossible  to  measure  the  flow  rate  of  a  heat  exchanger  directly.  a  complete  blockage  can  cause  serious  problems,  resulting  in  manufacturing  errors  and  hours  of  downtime.  one  solution  to  this  issue  is  to  measure  the  temperature  differential  upstream  and  downstream  of  the  heat  exchanger.  after  gathering  and  visualizing  the  measured  values,  it  is  possible  to  define  threshold  values.  these  values  can  then  be  input  into  an  alert  system  to  notify  employees  as  soon  as  the  first  signs  of

__label__machineconditionmonitoring about  analytics  on  iot  data  is  that  it  involves  datasets  generated  by  sensors,  which  are  now  both  cheap  and  sophisticated  enough  to  support  a  seemingly  endless  variety  of  use  cases.  the  potential  of  sensors  lies  in  their  ability  to  gather  data  about  the  physical  environment,  which  can  then  be  analyzed  or  combined  with  other  forms  of  data  to  detect  patterns.  dr.  joachim  schaper  is  senior  vice  president  of  research  and  head  of  the  advanced  analytics  lab  at  a  leading  player  in  the  emerging  iot  analytics  market.  his  views  represent  the  combined  expertise  and  experience  of  agts  rd  team,  which  includes
__label__machineconditionmonitoring more  than  80  people.  schaper  explains  that  sensor  data  can  also  be  used  to  understand  people  as  well  as  things:  the  ability  of  sensors  to  understand  physics  reveals  some  of  the  realtime  context  around  a  given  person,  which  can  then  be  combined  with  the  expressiveness  of  social  media  data  to  yield  a  strong  understanding  of  an  individual  person  or  a  group  of  people.  if  this  is  done  right,  it  can  enable  a  huge  set  of  new  services  for  the  consumer.  the  following  video  shows  agts  solutions  at  work.  in  this  example,  machine  learningassisted  video  analytics  track  an  audiences  movements  during

__label__machineconditionmonitoring transformative  business  impacts  across  a  number  of  verticals.  iot  solutions  have  the  potential  to  completely  rewrite  how  businesses  think  of  their  customers.  one  way  in  which  this  is  happening  already  is  by  analyzing  information  about  how  consumers  use  a  businesss  internetconnected  products.  by  way  of  example,  take  the  following  dashboard  from  ,  a  developer  of  selfservice  and  guided  analytics  solutions:  product  usage  data  collated  with  social  media  and  revenue  data  in  farnaz  erfan,  senior  director  of  product  strategy  at  birst,  explains  how  iot  connected  coffee  makers  transmit  information  to  the  manufacturer  about  how  many  pots  of  coffee  a  consumer  is
__label__machineconditionmonitoring brewing  per  day.  this  data  can  then  be  correlated  with  social  media  data  to  determine  whether  consumers  who  brew  more  coffee  are  more  likely  to  be  actively  discussing  the  brand  on  social  media.  additionally,  the  vendor  can  see  whether  variations  in  the  amount  of  coffee  brewed  by  consumers  correspond  to  the  amount  of  coffee  capsules  also  sold  by  the  vendor.  one  fascinating  aspect  of  analytics  on  iot  data  that  erfan  highlights  is  the  potential  for  analytics  to  be  both  businessfacing  and  consumerfacing  at  the  same  time.  by  way  of  example,  erfan  mentions  a  birst  deployment  for  a  utilities  client  selling
__label__machineconditionmonitoring smart  energy  meters  that  dont  require  meter  readers:  they  sell  into  state  and  county  governments  as  well  as  private  energy  providers,  so  that  organizations  can  perform  fraud  detection  on  the  meter  data  as  well  as  revenue  projections.  the  other  channel,  however,  is  consumeroriented,  she  says,  as  the  analytics  enable  portals  for  consumers  to  manage  their  energy  consumption,  see  how  much  theyre  over  and  under  other  households  in  the  neighborhood,  turn  appliances  on  and  off  to  determine  how  they  impact  energy  usage  etc.  in  this  case,  the  business  generates  value  from  the  same  analytics  in  two  ways:  one  of  the  most
__label__machineconditionmonitoring exciting  domains  in  iot  analytics  is  the  emerging  field  of  social  analytics.  social  analytics  involves  using  sensor  data,  video  data,  social  media  data  etc.  to  gain  actionable  insights  into  the  personalities  and  behaviors  of  individuals  and  groups.  agt  has  helped  to  establish  this  field  through  its  pioneering  focus  on  connected  events.  schaper  explains  that  at  connected  events,  the  things  on  which  sensors  are  deployed  are  people:  we  have  created  a  complete  solution  on  mobile  with  the  respective  backend  analytics  for  fashion  and  for  the  european  basketball  league.  what  weve  done  there  is  to  deploy  iot  sensors  at  the  venue,  on
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  models  in  the  case  of  fashion  shows  and  on  the  referees  and  coaches  in  the  case  of  basketball  games.  these  sensors  enable  the  analysis  of  human  emotions  rather  than  device  usage  a  form  of  analytics  known  as  sentiment  analysis  .  dr.  gadi  lenz,  agts  chief  scientist,  explains  that  biometric  sensors  and  networks  are  important  enabling  technologies  for  sentiment  analysis:  agt  is  using  video  facial  expressions,  accelerometers  and  gyros  motion,  audio  cheering  and  booing,  heart  rate  excitement,  skin  conductance  stress  etc.,  coupled  with  machinelearning  based  analytics  to  infer  peoples  emotions  in  a  way  that  was  not  possible  before.  for  instance,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring schaper  explains  that  biometric  sensors  on  coaches  link  the  motions  of  this  notoriously  fidgety  demographic  to  their  feelings  about  the  game,  as  we  saw  in  the  video  at  .  weve  created  a  socalled  agitation  index  for  coaches,  which  analyzes  movement  to  measure  their  level  of  involvement  throughout  the  game.  if  you  then  relate  this  data  to  the  game  data  when  free  throws  happen,  when  3pointers  happen  etc.,  you  get  very  interesting  correlations.  using  agts  video  analytics  to  create  an  agitation  index  for  coaches  much  of  what  agt  does  at  connected  events  extends  beyond  sensor  data  into  the  field  of  video
__label__machineconditionmonitoring analytics,  particularly  a  form  of  analytics  based  on  machine  learning  that  agt  calls  video  anomaly  detection.  he  explains  that  this  kind  of  video  analytics  takes  the  raw  input  from  a  camera  and  learns  the  scene.  facial  recognition  and  motion  detection  are  both  crucial  areas  in  enabling  social  analytics  via  video.  in  the  case  of  fashion  shows,  schaper  notes,  we  can  use  motion  detection  to  determine  where  the  audience  is  actually  looking  to  detect  events  that  draw  the  attention  of  the  whole  group.  we  measure  that  by  looking  at  their  faces  and  using  eye  position  and  mouth  position  to  understand  the
__label__machineconditionmonitoring focus  and  level  of  interest  of  the  person.  currently,  social  analytics  is  creating  business  value  through  supporting  the  video  capture  of  important  moments  at  events.  by  analyzing  the  emotions,  behaviors  and  focal  points  of  a  crowd  to  pinpoint  the  highlights  of  the  event,  video  clips  can  be  created  that  tie  in  naturally  with  the  interests  of  the  crowd  and,  by  extension,  online  viewers  as  well.  agts  video  analytics  have  helped  in  the  creation  of  short  stories  and  youtube  clips  by  delivering  recommendations  to  editors  about  which  moments  at  an  event  were  most  significant  for  the  audience  and  for  participants.  schaper
__label__machineconditionmonitoring notes  that  this  content  went  on  to  rack  up  2  million  views  across  facebook  and  youtube,  along  with  branded  videos  showing  the  use  of  machine  learning  to  understand  the  emotional  states  of  models:  agt  machinelearning  technologies  read  models  emotional  states  protecting  infrastructure  goes  beyond  predictive  maintenance,  and  frequently  people  need  protection  from  infrastructure.  agt  actually  got  its  start  in  protecting  oilfield  infrastructure  through  deployments  of  cameras  alongside  motion  and  radar  sensors.  in  surveillance  contexts,  the  detection  of  anomalies  is  crucial,  and  agt  does  this  through  a  novel  mechanism:  we  let  the  machine  try  to  figure  out  what  the  state  of
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  feed  is  and  derive  normal  or  abnormal  things  over  time.  we  create  anomaly  indices,  and  if  something  pushes  past  threshold  its  counted  as  an  anomaly.  human  operators  monitoring  the  sensor  feeds  can  even  adjust  the  threshold  for  what  counts  as  an  event  worthy  of  their  attention,  as  in  the  following  example  of  a  traffic  management  system  based  on  video  analytics:  adjusting  anomaly  indices  in  agts  videobased  traffic  management  system  the  line  in  the  graph  at  the  bottom  represents  the  threshold  of  significance  set  by  the  operator,  while  peaks  indicate  anomalous  events  a  stalled  car,  a  car  moving  in  the
__label__machineconditionmonitoring wrong  direction  etc.  that  pass  the  threshold  and  hence  require  the  attention  of  a  human  being.  because  this  technology  is  based  on  machine  learning,  schaper  explains,  users  dont  have  to  define  complex  rules  to  determine  what  counts  as  an  event.  instead,  the  software  itself  figures  this  out:  if  you  use  this  in  traffic,  the  analytics  will  learn  that  there  are  four  lanes,  two  in  each  direction,  and  typically  the  car  flow  goes  on  the  left  side  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  and  on  the  right  side  from  the  bottom  to  the  top.  if  the  analytics  detect  a  strong  movement
__label__machineconditionmonitoring from  left  to  right  in  the  video  signal,  thats  an  indication  of  an  accident  and  the  analytics  will  trigger  an  alarm.  such  technologies  are  useful  for  adjusting  operations,  as  well  as  for  ensuring  safety.  agts  video  analytics  are  also  being  used  to  manage  crowd  movements  in  queues  and  crowd  density  at  events.  the  use  cases  weve  examined  should  give  you  some  idea  of  the  breadth  of  what  you  can  achieve  with  iot  analytics.  we  havent  covered  the  details  of  the  enabling  technologies  behind  iot  platforms,  which  use  specialized  types  of  data  science  to  deal  with  vast,  realtime  datasets  generated  by

__label__machineconditionmonitoring predict  the  future  as  well.  maintenance  is  a  key  area  that  can  drive  major  cost  savings  and  production  value  around  the  world.  the  cost  of  machine  downtime  is  high:  according  to  the  international  society  of  automation,  over  the  years  businesses  have  overhauled  maintenance  processes  to  alleviate  downtime  and  improve  effectiveness.  there  still  seems  to  be  confusion,  however,  around  the  best  way  to  use  data  in  the  quest  for  optimum  operational  efficiency.  with  ai  and  machine  learning,  we  have  the  ability  to  process  massive  amounts  of  sensor  data  faster  than  ever  before.  this  gives  companies  an  unprecedented  chance  to  improve  upon
__label__machineconditionmonitoring existing  maintenance  operations  and  even  add  something  new:  predictive  maintenance.  one  industry  that  can  expect  to  see  unprecedented  savings  from  ai  is  manufacturing.  while  most  manufacturers  are  already  using  some  form  of  preventive  or  predictive  maintenance,  ai  can  usher  in  a  new  era  of  productivity.  you  might  be  wondering:  how  do  data,  machine  learning  and  ai  fit  into  the  current  maintenance  system  im  already  using?  lets  break  down  a  few  common  maintenance  types  and  the  role  ai  plays  in  each.  tpm  is  a  holistic  system  of  maintaining  and  improving  critical  assets  and  operational  processes  that  results  in  fewer  breakdowns,  less
__label__machineconditionmonitoring downtime,  increased  production  and  improved  safety.  developed  in  the  1960s,  many  industrial  enterprises  use  this  method  today  to  proactively  complete  machine  maintenance  based  upon  historical  data  and  timetables  of  when  repairs  are  expected  to  be  needed.  using  concepts  of  planned  maintenance,  tpm  aims  to  improve  overall  equipment  effectiveness  oee  and  plant  productivity.  with  regular  equipment  maintenance,  you  can  avoid  breakdowns  and  increase  uptime  of  assets.  one  of  the  core  features  of  tpm  is  autonomous  maintenance  am.  this  type  of  maintenance  makes  everyone  responsible  for  machine  performance  and  upkeep.  equipment  maintenance  is  carried  out  by  the  machine  operators  themselves,  instead  of
__label__machineconditionmonitoring maintenance  technicians  being  the  only  ones  to  repair  assets.  by  having  machine  operators  perform  regular  maintenance  on  assets,  technicians  are  freed  up  to  focus  on  larger  adjustments  to  improve  overall  machine  reliability.  am  is  often  challenging  to  implement  because  it  takes  a  great  deal  of  communication  and  training.  machine  operators  lack  the  historical  machine  knowledge  that  technicians  have,  and  technicians  might  not  be  so  quick  to  give  up  certain  tasks  without  foresight  into  new  job  duties  on  the  horizon.  now,  businesses  can  take  advantage  of  aidriven  software  that  makes  adoption  of  am  easier.  operators  on  the  front  line  can  understand
__label__machineconditionmonitoring their  machines  even  better  than  before.  having  all  your  historical  data  in  one  easytoaccess  dashboard  keeps  everyone  at  your  company  on  the  same  page  and  makes  it  easier  for  machines  to  get  serviced,  faster.  now,  businesses  can  ensure  that  each  operator  has  the  right  tools  and  the  right  knowledge  at  the  right  time  to  get  the  job  done.  ppm,  also  known  simply  as  planned  maintenance,  is  maintenance  that  is  driven  by  time  or  events  that  necessitate  repair.  a  main  component  of  tpm,  this  type  of  system  means  maintenance  is  scheduled  while  machines  are  still  working  in  order  to  prevent  unplanned
__label__machineconditionmonitoring downtime  and  maximize  the  lifespan  and  productivity  of  equipment.  while  effective,  there  are  certain  drawbacks  to  this  method.  its  not  an  exact  science,  you  run  the  risk  of  overmaintaining  or  undermaintaining  your  assets,  and  it  relies  on  guidelines  for  routine  checkups  but  doesnt  take  into  account  contextual  information.  uses  conditionbased  indicators  and  alerts  to  surface  maintenance  needs  only  when  your  trucks  are  at  risk  of  breaking  down  optimizing  your  maintenance  cadence  and  maximizing  vehicle  availability.  for  example,  a  car  will  alert  you  when  the  engine  is  in  danger  of  overheating  outside  of  the  planned  maintenance  schedule.  this  type  of  maintenance
__label__machineconditionmonitoring is  proactively  performed  when  your  vehicles  are  still  working  but  at  high  risk  of  failure.  as  connectivity  and  data  accessibility  become  cheaper  and  more  widespread  in  industry,  many  companies  are  looking  to  predictive  maintenance,  or  conditionbased,  maintenance,  powered  by  machine  learning  and  analytics.  is  largely  driven  by  timebased  data.  for  example,  on  a  car,  maintenance  is  determined  by  the  amount  of  time  passed  or  mileage  driven  to  determine  when  maintenance  needs  to  be  done.  this  data  also  compares  how  a  specific  asset  is  performing  compared  to  the  rest  of  your  like  assets.  data  simply  tells  you  what  might  happen.  most
__label__machineconditionmonitoring maintenance  technologies  focus  on  transporting  data,  not  aggregating  it  into  realtime  analytics.  but  sending  the  data  is  just  the  first  step  what  you  do  with  that  data  is  what  really  matters.  ai  and  machine  learning  can  help  aggregate  and  make  use  of  your  data,  faster.  uses  data  from  various  sources  like  historical  maintenance  records,  sensor  data  from  machines,  and  weather  data  to  determine  when  a  machine  will  need  to  be  serviced.  leveraging  realtime  asset  data  plus  historical  data,  operators  can  make  more  informed  decisions  about  when  a  machine  will  need  a  repair.  predictive  maintenance  takes  massive  amounts  of  data  and
__label__machineconditionmonitoring through  the  use  of  ai  and  predictive  maintenance  software,  translates  that  data  into  meaningful  insights  and  data  points  helping  you  avoid  data  overload.  sensor  data  and  machine  learning  models  are  making  it  possible  to  quickly  extract  more  value  from  large  volumes  of  messy  data.  predictive  maintenance  tools  upgrade  your  existing  maintenance  systems  by  using  ai  to  ensure  that  your  people  have  the  right  knowledge  and  tools  to  keep  your  missioncritical  assets  running  at  peak  performance.  the  underlying  key  to  successfully  implementing  maintenance  operations  that  actually  meet  your  business  needs  is  understanding  what  questions  you  need  answers  to  and  how  data
__label__machineconditionmonitoring can  help  get  those  answers.  do  you  need  to  know  simply  what  has  already  occured  so  you  can  plan  and  budget  for  next  year?  or  do  you  need  to  know  how  to  prevent  unplanned  downtime,  lower  costs  and  expedite  repairs?  as  digitization  continues  to  transform  businesses  endtoend,  optimizing  your  operations  and  leveraging  not  only  preventive  maintenance,  but  predictive  maintenance  tools  as  well,  is  becoming  tablestakes  to  survive.  technology  is  not  a  luxury  anymore,  it  is  needed  to  remain  competitive,  reduce  downtime,  improve  safety  and  increase  profits.  want  to  learn  more  about  how  predictive  maintenance  is  being  brought  to  life  by

__label__machineconditionmonitoring conditionmonitoring  from  edge  to  cloud  to  backend  systems  by  chinmay  shete,  machfu  rotating  equipment,  used  widely  in  industrial  processes,  is  relied  upon  to  move  fluids  and  gases  through  production  operations  and  throughout  the  supply  chain,  and  transmit  power  in  motors  and  drives.  these  systems  are  designed  for  handling  oil  and  gas,  and  other  volatile  and  hazardous  chemicals  under  abrasive  conditions  and  pressure  changes,  where  safety  and  emissions  containment  are  crucial.  frequently  operating  in  remote  locations,  such  as  onshore  and  offshore  oil  and  gas  well  sites,  and  throughout  longdistance  pipelines,  failure  of  pumps  and  other  rotating  equipment  can  have  dire  consequences,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring jeopardizing  environmental  safety  and  energy  resources.  the  failure  of  a  single  missioncritical  pump,  fan,  blower,  or  turbocompressor  can  interrupt  production,  resulting  in  millions  of  dollars  per  day  in  lost  throughput  revenue.  because  industrial  plants  have  processes  that  contain  abrasives  and  solids  within  the  fluids  being  pumped,  these  insoluble  liquids  are  hard  on  rotating  equipment,  creating  added  abrasion  and  erosion  of  the  components.  as  with  all  rotating  equipment,  component  wear  is  a  constant  factor  requiring  monitoring,  maintenance,  repair,  and  replacement  to  keep  the  equipment  operating  as  required.  however,  due  to  the  sometimes  thousands  of  pumps  and  other  rotating  equipment  needed  to
__label__machineconditionmonitoring be  inspected  and  serviced  in  a  plant,  it  is  inevitable  there  will  be  some  degree  of  delayed  or  missed  routine  maintenance,  or  improper  system  servicing,  resulting  in  equipment  failure.  further,  frequencybased  maintenance  protocols  are  not  a  guarantee  for  predicting  or  identifying  earlyonset  machine  disruptions,  which  eventually  precipitate  equipment  failures.  a  growing  number  of  process  plants  are  converting  from  frequencybased  preventative  maintenance  of  their  rotating  equipment  to  conditionbased  maintenance  strategies,  which  provide  a  higher  level  of  reliability  against  equipment  failures  and  system  downtime.  it  also  enables  better  asset  utilization  and  system  longevity.  condition  monitoring  is  essential  to  a  conditionbased  maintenance  protocol.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring with  condition  monitoring,  data  is  collected  from  one  or  more  functions  of  a  rotating  machine.  these  can  include  vibration,  lubrication,  temperature,  pressure,  motor  current  signature,  and  electric  discharge.  this  data  is  collected,  either  manually  or  via  wireless  network,  then  input  directly  into  a  maintenance  database,  or  uploaded  to  the  cloud,  for  subsequent  analysis.  with  rotating  equipment,  vibration  is  a  key  factor  recorded,  and  every  machine  has  its  own  vibration  characteristic.  multiple  recordings  of  vibration  from  a  specific  machine  will  enable  a  baseline  to  be  set  for  that  machine.  so,  even  minor  changes  in  vibration  in  any  singular  machine  may  signal
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  need  for  a  closer  inspection.  where  many  plants  are  checking  and  recording  vibration  signatures  in  rotating  equipment  with  handheld  devices,  technology  is  rapidly  supporting  the  acquisition  of  machine  condition  data  through  wireless  monitoring.  itt,  inc.  has  developed  a  machine  monitor  sensor  adapted  for  particular  application  with  rotating  equipment,  called  the  ialert  bluetooth  equipment  health  monitor.  this  sensor,  which  mounts  directly  onto  the  rotating  equipment,  tracks  triaxial  vibration,  triaxial  kurtosis,  temperature,  and  runtime  hours  24/7/365.  it  wirelessly  syncs  this  data  to  an  ialert  mobile  app,  via  bluetooth  smartenabled  devices,  then  uploads  the  data  to  the  cloud.  data  signatures  of  the
__label__machineconditionmonitoring machine  are  uploaded  continuously,  and  alarms  if  the  equipment  is  outside  of  normal  operating  conditions,  visually  alerting  users,  and  wirelessly  broadcasting  an  alarm  message.  the  sensor  provides  powerful  vibration  analysis  tools  similar  those  found  on  pro  handheld  vibration  analyzers,  with  the  simplicity  that  any  technician  who  can  operate  a  smart  phone  or  tablet  can  easily  integrate  with  the  ialert  monitor.  the  industrial  internet  of  things  iiot  is  creating  new  methodologies  to  collect,  process,  and  push  data  from  the  network  edge  to  backend  servers  using  cloudbased  systems.  ialert  monitoring  has  leveraged  some  of  this  technology  to  enhance  its  functionality  by:  a

__label__machineconditionmonitoring these  sensors  can  communicate  with  any  mobile  computing  device  with  bluetooth  connectivity  and  can  even  communicate  with  multiple  bluvib  sensors  through  the  blugate  gateway  device.  lastly,  the  real  power  of  these  sensors  lies  in  its  ability  to  communicate  and  interface  with  blutrend,  a  software  package  that  provides  the  essential  functionality  of  a  realtime  monitoring  system  and  includes  comprehensive  analytical  capabilities.  together,  these  three  cuttingedge  technologies  produce  an  uncompromisingly  powerful  machinery  monitoring  package  that  is  low  cost,  quick  to  install  and  easy  to  use.  it  is  the  development  of  these  sensors  and  this  unique  technology  that  is  making  this  wireless  transition

__label__machineconditionmonitoring plant  operators  can  capture  machine  data  to  help  predict  when  machines  will  fail  or  require  maintenance  by  using  automated,  online  condition  monitoring.  one  energy  company  manually  monitored  rotating  equipment  at  a  power  generation  plant,  sometimes  taking  more  than  60,000  measurements  per  month.  these  manual  diagnostic  rounds  were  inconsistent  due  to  human  error  or  competing  priorities.  plus,  manual  collection  is  costly.  by  adopting  online  condition  monitoring  tools,  plants  can  monitor  the  condition  of  plant  equipment.  they  can  also  set  up  alarms  that  signal  when  equipment  is  stressed  or  needs  attention.  recently  products  have  been  introduced  to  help  companies  gain  insight  into
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  health  of  their  equipment.  with  years  of  experience  in  condition  monitoring,  plant  operators  can  costeffectively  monitor  both  critical  and  ancillary  rotating  machinery,  offering  a  holistic  view  of  their  plant  equipment.  the  solution  involves  data  management,  data  analysis,  and  systems  management  challenges  that  are  common  in  big  analog  data  applications.  sensorwork  is  designing  the  system  with  the  flexibility  and  open  architecture  to  make  evolving  diagnostic  requirements.  condition  monitoring  is  coming  into  its  own  as  part  of  the  technology  renaissance  in  manufacturing.  plus,  reductions  in  cost  have  made  the  technology  available  to  a  wider  range  of  users.  with  trends  such  as
__label__machineconditionmonitoring the  decreasing  cost  of  sensors  and  higher  performance  ratio  for  price,  we  are  seeing  more  adoption  than  we  did  in  the  past.  also,  with  the  trend  around  big  analog  data,  everyone  is  trying  to  solve  the  question  of  what  do  you  do  with  the  data?  in  past  people  would  only  monitor  critical  parts  and  systems  were  disparate,  but  today  there  is  a  drive  toward  gaining  more  business  value  from  condition  monitoring.  the  companies  most  interested  in  condition  monitoring  still  tend  to  be  the  companies  with  the  most  at  risk.  the  companies  that  are  most  motivated  to  solve  this  are  the

__label__machineconditionmonitoring efficiency,  and  cost  savings.  the  iiot  creates  a  universe  of  sensors  that  enables  an  accelerated  of  existing  operations.  these  data  tools  allow  for  rapid  contextualization,  automatic  pattern,  and  trend  detection.  furthering  this  for  manufacturing  operations  will  finally  allow  for  true  quantitative  capture  of  formerly  expert  qualitative  operations.  pictured  above:  production  in  both  discrete  and  process  manufacturing  industries  rely  on  throughput  and  is  a  complex  orchestration  of  command  and  control  systems  for  production  as  well  as  bolton  wireless  sensing  devices  on  brownfield  equipment.  however,  getting  in  the  way  of  this  digital  future  is  legacy  equipment,  security  concerns,  ot  vs.  it  culture,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring and  the  drowning  in  data  yet  starving  for  information  mode.  since  70  of  industrial  equipment  is  legacy  equipment,  it  does  not  have  all  the  latest  sensing  or  digital  product  features.  current  productionized  machine  learning  solutions  also  often  lack  real  domain  or  subject  matter  experts,  data  industrial  equipment  can  last  1020  years  so  is  very  infrequent  in  order  to  find  an  optimal  and  generalizable  models,  and  integration  into  automated  workflows.  while  data,  information,  and  data  science  solutions  are  increasingly  touted  as  the  oil  of  the  modern  enterprise,  it  is  often  poorly  designed,  poorly  understood,  and  poorly  utilized  in  daily  activities.  in
__label__machineconditionmonitoring this  case,  technology  advances  are  surpassing  our  ability  to  acclimate.  where  to  begin  when  we  look  to  big  data  to  detect  complex  patterns  for  entire  plant  or  batch  processes,  we  often  start  by  adding  sensors  to  measure  machine  health  to  older  equipment.  this  allows  us  to  add  intelligence  to  a  variety  of  critical  equipment  in  order  to  minimize  asset  downtime,  maximize  productivity,  and  ensure  workplace  safety.  rotating  equipment  such  as  pumps,  fans,  and  motors  are  in  every  plant  environment  and  is  a  major  share  of  the  condition  monitoring  asset  class.  they  often  have  problems  such  as  lubrication,  cavitation,  looseness,  imbalance,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring as  well  as  bearing  issues.  in  this  specific  area,  we  monitor  vibration  and  ultrasonic  energy  through  an  accelerometer,  which  is  deemed  the  critical  measurement  to  sense  problems  in  rotating  equipment.  when  a  problem  occurs  on  this  equipment,  a  maintenance  professional  generates  a  work  order  and  it  is  queued  up  to  be  serviced.  typically,  it  is  run  to  failure  or  a  vibration  analyst  is  brought  in  to  collect  hundreds  of  thousands  of  vibration  data  points,  calculate  the  fast  fourier  transform  for  a  spectrum  view  of  the  data,  analyze  the  spectrum,  and  compare  the  spectrum  to  historical  data.  the  question  then  becomes
__label__machineconditionmonitoring whether  or  not  we  can  leverage  that  analysis  on  a  continual  basis  to  have  continuous  machine  health  monitoring  and  preempt  catastrophic  failure.  this  is  what  is  known  in  iiot  as  predictive  analytics.  we  want  alerts  on  minor,  escalating,  and  highpriority  items.  however,  vibration  is  such  an  animal  that  it  does  not  fail  linearly.  there  is  a  hockey  stick  moment  that  has  been  collected  in  millions  of  cases  and  thoroughly  understood.  even  though  the  hockey  stick  failure  is  rather  unpredictable,  we  can  create  a  predictive  band  to  better  answer  the  question  when  will  it  fail?  having  a  timeframe  in  mind,  the
__label__machineconditionmonitoring operation  can  proactively  plan  and  schedule  for  maintenance  and  try  to  manage  within  a  planned  and  scheduled  downtime  for  maintenance  and  know  how  hard  it  can  push  these  assets.  condition  monitoring  in  common  practice,  continuous  vibration  monitoring  on  industrial  equipment  is  collected  in  the  21,000hz  frequency  range  and  is  trended,  reported,  and  alerted  in  inches  per  second  ips.  this  measurement  provides  a  good  indication  of  imbalance,  misalignment,  and/or  looseness.  alert  setting  guidelines  for  this  measurement  can  be  found  in  iso  10816.  additionally,  this  21,000  hz  low  frequency  vibration  is  successfully  used  for  equipment  shutdown  and  personnel  safety.  this  measurement  is
__label__machineconditionmonitoring referred  to  as  overall  vibration  and  is  helpful  for  late  stage  identification  of  failures.  however,  by  itself,  it  is  not  a  good  early  warning  or  predictive  analytics  on  the  future  health  of  the  machine.  pictured  above:  the  blue  line  or  overall  vibration  indicates  that  there  are  some  issues  imbalance,  misalignment,  looseness,  but  there  is  not  enough  granularity  to  pick  up  the  bearing  faults  to  enable  30  days  or  more  of  advanced  warning  to  allow  the  plant  to  schedule  appropriately.  conversely,  the  highfrequency  ultrasonic  line  in  green  enables  visibility  to  see  machine  health  issues  30,  60  or  90  days  in  advance.
__label__machineconditionmonitoring it  is  in  the  1,00030,000  hz  frequencies,  including  ultrasonic  frequencies,  where  the  future  or  predictive  data  of  machinery  health  is  detected.  in  the  past,  this  has  been  largely  a  manual  process,  completed  on  a  monthly  data  collection  and  analysis  by  an  experienced  vibration  analyst.  however,  new,  cheaper,  and  faster  processing  of  sensor  data  has  enabled  continuous  ultrasonic  monitoring  for  predictive  maintenance.  in  this  case,  the  same  accelerometer  used  above  is  now  sampled  at  very  high  frequencies  a  100mv/g  piezo  accelerometer  is  common.  this  measurement  is  trended,  reported,  and  alerted  in  gs  acceleration  and  provides  a  good  early  warning  of  lubrication
__label__machineconditionmonitoring fault,  early  bearing  fault,  cavitation,  and/or  friction  faults.  alert  setting  for  this  measurement  does  not  have  an  industry  standard,  however  some  vendors  like  assetscan  publish  alert  setting  guidelines.  this  measurement  is  referred  to  as  peak  fault  or  bearing  fault  monitoring  and/or  casually  as  ultrasonic  monitoring.  although  the  measurement  comes  from  the  same  sensor,  this  second  sampling  rate  and  calculation  creates  a  measurement  that  is  separate  and  mutually  exclusive  from  the  overall  vibration  measurement  commonly  found  in  industry  today.  the  peak  fault  algorithm  captures  peak  data  in  contrast  to  other  techniques  that  use  root  mean  square  rms.  by  doing  so,  it
__label__machineconditionmonitoring has  good  separation  from  the  noise  floor,  which  is  often  an  issue  on  slow  rotating  machinery.  additionally,  the  peak  fault  algorithm  has  alert  guidelines  that  do  not  require  baselining  to  set  alerts.  easy  alert  setting  enables  assettoasset  comparison  over  a  wide  class  of  assets  and  eliminates  confusion  on  how  bad  is  bad,  or  how  good  is  good.  for  example,  the  alert  limits  for  machines  running  between  600  6,000  rpm  the  majority  of  industrial  equipment  are  6,  12,  and  18  gs  for  minor,  warning  and  critical  alerts.  this  breakthrough  enables  data  labeling  that  is  critical  to  machine  learning,  as  well  as
__label__machineconditionmonitoring beneficial  to  operations  and  maintenance  teams  to  create  prescriptive  tasks  or  work  orders.  predictive  analytics  with  machine  learning,  we  want  to  extend  our  subject  matter  expertise  to  illustrate  the  predictive  band  even  further.  polynomial  regression  fits  a  nonlinear  relationship  between  the  value  of  x  and  the  corresponding  conditional  mean,  and  has  been  used  to  describe  nonlinear  phenomena  such  as  the  fault  rate  of  bearings  where  x  is  time  and  y  is  ultrasonic  vibration  measured  in  gs.  this  type  of  regression  is  used  for  the  upper  limit  of  the  confidence  band  and  matched  best  with  our  data  and  domain  expertise  mapping
__label__machineconditionmonitoring back  to  the  hockey  stick  or  nonlinear  failure  and  conservative  approach  to  ensure  no  underestimation  or  underfit  model.  the  lower  limit  of  the  confidence  band  was  estimated  using  simple  .  pictured  above:  polynomial  regression  as  upper  predictive  band  is  utilized  to  fit  nonlinear  data  and  linear  regression  is  employed  for  lower  confidence  band.  providing  more  feedback  over  time  will  improve  the  model,  considering  particular  industrial  machines  in  particular  environments  with  more  data.  this  will  give  plants  and  manufacturers  more  time  to  react  to  potential  machine  failures  resulting  in  reduced  unplanned  downtime,  more  productivity,  more  cost  savings  on  equipment,  and  improved

__label__machineconditionmonitoring time  and  money  while  failing  to  deliver  results.  here,  we  will  focus  on  the  strategies  and  technology  required  for  successful  transition.  switching  to  predictive  maintenance  is  a  process,  not  an  event.  it  involves  hardware  changes,  software  changes,  and  most  of  all,  changes  to  the  manufacturing  and  maintenance  culture.  success  starts  with  strategic  planning.  especially  in  complex  manufacturing  environments,  attempting  to  apply  predictive  maintenance  to  all  assets  simultaneously  is  a  quick  route  to  failure.  it  frequently  leads  to  a  deluge  of  data  that  rarely  even  gets  used,  let  alone  provides  insights.  the  result  is  often  an  expensive  effort  that  squanders  money
__label__machineconditionmonitoring and  staff  hours,  causes  frustration,  and  generally  fails  to  deliver  the  promised  benefits.  the  best  approach  is  to  start  small,  with  a  focused  pilot  program.  choose  a  single  issue  to  address.  be  patientthe  goal  is  to  establish  a  robust  process  and  log  a  success.  once  the  pilot  project  is  complete,  other  lowhanging  fruit  will  appear.  making  a  smooth  transition  to  predictive  maintenance  depends  on  the  success  of  the  pilot  program.  that  starts  with  choosing  the  right  asset  to  monitor.  there  are  several  basic  classes  that  lend  themselves  to  predictive  maintenance  and  fast  results.  assets  that  have  failed  previously,  particularly  if
__label__machineconditionmonitoring they  have  failed  frequently,  are  excellent  candidates  for  a  pilot  program.  applying  monitoring  and  predictive  maintenance  techniques  not  only  help  prevent  downtime,  they  generate  data  that  could  help  identify  root  cause  of  failure.  this  opens  the  way  to  potentially  modifying  operations  and  mitigating  the  problem.  traditionally,  condition  monitoring  for  predictive  maintenance  was  applied  to  expensive  equipment  such  as  hydroelectric  or  gas  turbines.  motors  costing  a  few  hundred  dollars  each  were  not  considered  important  enough  to  justify  purchasing  and  installing  monitoring  equipment.  however,  this  equipment  may  still  be  critical;  if  a  blower  motor  is  essential  to  the  operation  of  a  production
__label__machineconditionmonitoring line  that  feeds  the  entire  plant,  then  that  motor  is  a  critical  asset,  whether  it  costs  20  or  20,000.  for  operations  running  around  the  clock  or  on  tight  deadlines,  shutting  down  the  line  for  unscheduled  maintenance  can  be  an  expensive  proposition.  predictive  maintenance  equips  maintenance  and  operations  staff  to  carefully  run  the  asset  as  long  as  possible  with  the  assurance  that  if  condition  begins  to  change,  they  can  stop  the  asset  before  catastrophic  failure  takes  place.  some  assets  require  expensive  equipment  for  the  replacement  process.  a  rooftop  fan,  for  example,  might  require  a  hoist  or  crane  that  can  be  expensive
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  rent,  time  consuming  to  operate,  and  unavailable  on  short  notice.  receiving  advance  warning  of  issues  makes  it  possible  to  schedule  maintenance  and  minimize  interruption.  in  a  perfect  world,  the  storage  room  in  the  maintenance  department  would  have  a  replacement  part  for  every  component  on  the  floor.  that  simply  isnt  possible,  either  logistically  or  financially,  however.  they  may  have  long  lead  times,  particularly  if  they  require  customization.  short  turnarounds  may  entail  expediting  fees  that  will  increase  price  by  a  substantial  amount.  assets  that  are  difficult  to  access  are  good  candidates  for  a  predictive  maintenance  program.  this  may  involve  an  asset
__label__machineconditionmonitoring in  an  inaccessible  location  such  as  a  rooftop  during  wintertime  or  in  a  confined  space  or  in  a  hazardous  location.  overtaxed  maintenance  staff  may  avoid  monitoring  as  a  result.  hardtoreach  assets  may  also  present  a  concern  if  the  asset  cannot  be  safely  monitored  while  running.  image:  often  overlooked,  cooling  towers  and  fans  are  difficult  to  reach,  remote,  and  may  be  difficult  to  replace.  depending  on  the  process,  they  may  also  be  critical  to  production  making  them  good  candidates  to  start  a  predictive  maintenance  program  with.  predictive  maintenance  uses  a  variety  of  technologies  to  monitor  the  condition  of  rotating  equipment.  each
__label__machineconditionmonitoring technology  operates  over  a  different  time  window  see  table.  its  important  to  match  the  timeframe  to  the  needs  of  the  application.  some  methods  allow  you  to  detect  problems  years  before  the  may  equipment  fail,  but  you  should  consider  the  amount  of  early  notice  needed  to  act.  for  most  facilities,  years  of  notice  may  be  too  far  in  advance  to  act.  when  considering  a  pilot  program,  where  short  term  results  are  ideal,  vibration  analysis  is  arguably  the  most  effective  monitoring  technology  for  rotating  assets.  one  of  the  key  benefits  is  that  it  lends  itself  to  continuous  monitoring  by  software.  the  vibration
__label__machineconditionmonitoring analyst  establishes  triggers  and  sets  alerts  for  whenever  a  condition  is  violated.  graph:  vibration  data  can  be  used  to  predict  several  failure  modes  in  rotating  assets  including  misalignment,  looseness,  bearing  defects  and  more.  with  the  advent  of  the  industrial  internet  of  things  iot,  devices  that  utilizes  cloudstorage  and  embedded  computing  have  driven  down  the  cost  of  continuous  vibration  monitoring  to  be  accessible  for  any  facility.  some  of  these  devices  allow  multiple  sensor  inputs,  such  as  temperature  and  speed,  to  provide  a  more  complete  picture  of  asset  health.  one  such  example,  is  the  the  traditional  approach  to  condition  monitoring  has  been
__label__machineconditionmonitoring to  take  manual  readings,  almost  always  using  a  handheld  device.  this  is  generally  performed  on  a  scheduled  basis  as  part  of  routebased  monitoring.  this  is  a  useful  technique  but  it  has  a  major  drawback:  it  can  only  reveal  the  status  of  the  equipment  at  the  time  of  the  reading.  if  a  fault  develops  immediately  after,  it  will  not  be  detected  until  the  event  of  failure  or  the  next  reading,  whichever  happens  first.  as  a  result,  this  approach  is  not  truly  predictive.  for  these  reasons,  organizations  have  increasingly  been  adopting  continuous  online  condition  monitoring  technology.  these  systems  use  a  sensor  installed
__label__machineconditionmonitoring on  the  equipment  for  continuous  readout  of  data.  they  can  be  interrogated  on  a  schedule  or  networked  in  order  to  export  data  for  analysis  on  a  nearrealtime  basis.  builtin  triggering  and  analytics  functionality  can  enable  them  to  send  alerts  in  the  event  any  parameters  exceed  preset  thresholds.  the  next  step  of  a  predictive  maintenance  plan  is  to  establish  a  procedure  for  responding  to  anomalies.  if  the  plan  is  based  on  continuous  online  condition  monitoring,  the  procedure  is  as  simple  as  awaiting  instructions  from  the  vibration  tech  or  field  technician.  based  on  their  analysis,  they  will  most  likely  give  one  of
__label__machineconditionmonitoring three  directions:  once  the  detailed  plan  is  in  place,  it  is  time  for  the  fun  part:  installing  the  sensor,  acquiring  data,  and  gaining  a  better  understanding  of  the  assets.  be  sure  to  document  the  project  and  record  successes.  conduct  a  postmortem  to  review  lessons  learned.  they  will  be  helpful  in  the  next  phase  when  predictive  maintenance  is  extended  to  additional  assets.  before  scaling  to  multiple  assets,  a  data  analysis  strategy  should  be  established.  this  is  particularly  important  for  continuous  online  monitoring.  the  data  volumes  are  large  enough  that  they  can  consume  significant  amounts  of  storage  space  and  bandwidth.  to  simplify,
__label__machineconditionmonitoring there  are  two  options:  inhouse  or  thirdparty  service  providers  field  technicians  or  analysis  by  inhouse  experts.  if  the  responsibility  will  remain  inhouse,  organizations  need  to  determine  whether  that  will  be  performed  by  an  existing  expert,  whether  staff  will  need  to  be  trained,  or  whether  an  expert  with  the  required  skills  will  be  hired.  it  is  important  to  remember  that  vibration  monitoring  requires  care  and  attention.  expecting  existing  staff  to  acquire  the  necessary  expertise  to  take  on  the  task,  particularly  while  maintaining  preexisting  duties,  may  be  unrealistic.  for  companies  with  limited  resources,  the  easiest  route  may  be  to  work  with  a
__label__machineconditionmonitoring thirdparty  field  technician.  these  individuals  and  organizations  have  expertise  in  reliability  and  condition  monitoring.  with  the  aid  of  an  online  condition  monitoring  sensor  that  enables  them  to  access  data  remotely,  they  can  very  effectively  track  asset  health  and  troubleshoot  any  problems.  once  you  have  proven  the  success  of  the  pilot  program  and  identified  the  resources  needed  to  monitor  data,  return  to  the  list  of  assets  identified  as  candidates  for  the  pilot  program.  these  may  include  critical,  troubled,  difficult  to  source  or  difficult  to  replace  assets  as  well  as  assets  in  remote  locations  and  those  that  have  a  history  of  failure.

__label__machineconditionmonitoring pi  system  captures  data  from  sensors,  manufacturing  equipment  and  other  devices  and  transforms  it  into  rich,  realtime,  actionable  insights.  it  enables  industrial  customers  to  manage  assets,  mitigate  risks,  comply  with  regulations,  improve  processes  and  drive  innovation.  picture  how  a  natural  gasfueled  power  plant  would  typically  monitor  the  health  of  a  critical  water  injection  pump  or  a  boiler  feed  pump.  traditionally,  the  power  plant  would  continuously  monitor  process  variables  such  as  pressure,  flow  or  temperature  of  the  plant  water.  the  process  information  would  then  be  collected  in  the  dcs  system  and  trended  in  the  pi  system.  however,  the  reliability  data  such
__label__machineconditionmonitoring as  vibration  or  current  draw  of  a  pump  would  be  collected  a  few  times  a  year  through  manual  walkaround  programs,  using  handheld  data  collectors.  reliability  data  would  then  be  siloed  from  operational  data.  similarly,  the  data  surrounding  building  energy  management  would  often  be  captured  by  another  system.  while  these  data  sources  can  easily  be  combined  in  the  pi  system,  customers  often  dont  think  about  unifying  them,  making  it  more  difficult  to  see  the  big  picture.  failure  to  break  these  data  silos  could  mean  that  a  critical  bearing  failure  goes  undetected,  resulting  in  unplanned  downtime  and  unanticipated  repair  costs.  petasense  and
