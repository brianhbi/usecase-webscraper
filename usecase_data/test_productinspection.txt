__label__productinspection integrating  smart,  connected  farm  equipmentsuch  as  tractors,  tillers,  and  planterscan  enable  better  overall  equipment  performance.  the  basis  of  competition  thus  shifts  from  the  functionality  of  a  discrete  product  to  the  performance  of  the  broader  product  system,  in  which  the  firm  is  just  one  actor.  the  manufacturer  can  now  offer  a  package  of  connected  equipment  and  related  services  that  optimize  overall  results.  thus  in  the  farm  example,  the  industry  expands  from  tractor  manufacturing  to  farm  equipment  optimization.  in  mining,  joy  global  has  shifted  from  optimizing  the  performance  of  individual  pieces  of  mining  equipment  to  optimizing  across  the  fleet  of  equipment  deployed
__label__productinspection in  the  mine.  industry  boundaries  expand  from  discrete  types  of  mining  machines  to  mining  equipment  systems.  the  increasing  capabilities  of  smart,  connected  products  not  only  reshape  competition  within  industries  but  expand  industry  boundaries.  this  occurs  as  the  basis  of  competition  shifts  from  discrete  products,  to  product  systems  consisting  of  closely  related  products,  to  systems  of  systems  that  link  an  array  of  product  systems  together.  a  tractor  company,  for  example,  may  find  itself  competing  in  a  broader  farm  automation  industry.  increasingly,  however,  industry  boundaries  are  expanding  even  beyond  product  systems  to  systems  of  systemsthat  is,  a  set  of  disparate  product  systems

__label__productinspection capture  disproportionate  value.  some  companieslike  john  deere,  agco,  and  joy  globalare  intentionally  seeking  to  broaden  and  redefine  their  industries.  others  may  find  themselves  threatened  by  this  development,  which  creates  new  competitors,  new  bases  for  competition,  and  the  need  for  entirely  new  and  broader  capabilities.  companies  that  fail  to  adapt  may  find  their  traditional  products  becoming  commoditized  or  may  themselves  be  relegated  to  the  role  of  oem  supplier,  with  system  integrators  in  control.  more  the  net  effect  of  smart,  connected  products  on  industry  structure  will  vary  across  industries,  but  some  tendencies  seem  clear.  first,  rising  barriers  to  entry,  coupled  with  firstmover
__label__productinspection advantages  stemming  from  the  early  accumulation  and  analysis  of  product  usage  data,  suggests  that  many  industries  may  undergo  consolidation.  second,  consolidation  pressures  will  be  amplified  in  industries  whose  boundaries  are  expanding.  in  such  cases,  single  product  manufacturers  will  have  difficulty  competing  with  multiproduct  companies  that  can  optimize  product  performance  across  broader  systems.  third,  important  new  entrants  are  likely  to  emerge,  as  companies  unencumbered  by  legacy  product  definitions  and  entrenched  ways  of  competing,  and  with  no  historical  profit  pools  to  protect,  seize  opportunities  to  leverage  the  full  potential  of  smart,  connected  products  to  create  value.  some  of  these  strategies  will  be

__label__productinspection equipment,  and  stateoftheart  sales  force  methods,  it  solutions,  and  supply  chain  management  approaches.  oe  is  the  table  stakes  of  competition.  if  a  company  is  not  operationally  effective  and  continually  embracing  new  best  practices,  it  will  fall  behind  rivals  in  cost  and  quality.  yet  oe  is  rarely  a  source  of  sustainable  advantage,  because  competitors  will  implement  the  same  best  practices  and  catch  up.  to  move  beyond  oe,  a  company  must  define  a  distinctive  strategic  positioning.  whereas  operational  effectiveness  is  about  doing  things  well,  strategic  positioning  is  about  doing  things  differently.  a  company  must  choose  how  it  will  deliver  unique  value  to
__label__productinspection the  set  of  customers  it  chooses  to  serve.  strategy  requires  making  tradeoffs:  deciding  not  only  what  to  do  but  what  not  to  do.  smart,  connected  products  are  defining  a  new  standard  for  operational  effectiveness,  dramatically  raising  the  bar  in  terms  of  best  practices.  every  product  company  will  have  to  decide  how  to  incorporate  smart,  connected  capabilities  into  its  products.  but  not  only  the  product  itself  is  being  affected.  as  we  discussed  earlier,  the  move  to  smart,  connected  products  also  creates  new  best  practices  across  the  value  chain.  the  implications  of  smart,  connected  products  for  the  value  chain  will  be  discussed
__label__productinspection in  detail  in  the  second  article  in  this  series  see  the  sidebar  charting  the  impact  on  competition.  here  we  focus  briefly  on  how  smart,  connected  products  affect  product  design,  service,  marketing,  human  resources,  and  security,  because  these  shifting  internal  activities  often  bear  directly  on  strategy  choices.  this  article  is  the  first  in  a  twopart  series  in  which  we  examine  how  smart,  connected  products  are  shifting  competition  in  many  industries.  at  the  most  fundamental  level,  companies  must  ask  four  questions:  1.  how  does  the  move  to  smart,  connected  products  affect  the  structure  of  the  industry  and  industry  boundaries?  2.  how  do
__label__productinspection smart,  connected  products  affect  the  configuration  of  the  value  chain  or  the  set  of  activities  required  to  compete?  3.  what  new  types  of  strategic  choices  will  smart,  connected  products  require  companies  to  make  to  achieve  competitive  advantage?  4.  what  are  the  organizational  implications  of  embracing  these  new  types  of  products  and  the  challenges  that  affect  implementation  success?  in  this  article,  we  examine  the  effect  of  smart,  connected  products  on  industry  structure  and  industry  boundaries  and  discuss  the  new  strategic  choices  facing  companies.  in  part  two  forthcoming,  we  examine  value  chain  impacts  and  organizational  issues.  disclosure:  ptc  does  business  with  more
__label__productinspection than  28,000  companies  worldwide,  many  of  which  are  mentioned  in  this  article.  more  smart,  connected  products  require  a  whole  set  of  new  design  principles,  such  as  designs  that  achieve  hardware  standardization  through  softwarebased  customization,  designs  that  enable  personalization,  designs  that  incorporate  the  ability  to  support  ongoing  product  upgrades,  and  designs  that  enable  predictive,  enhanced,  or  remote  service.  expertise  in  systems  engineering  and  in  agile  software  development  is  essential  to  integrate  a  products  hardware,  electronics,  software,  operating  system,  and  connectivity  componentsexpertise  that  is  not  well  developed  in  many  manufacturing  companies.  product  development  processes  will  also  need  to  accommodate  more  latestage  and
__label__productinspection postpurchase  design  changes  quickly  and  efficiently.  companies  will  need  to  synchronize  the  very  different  clock  speeds  of  hardware  and  software  development;  a  software  development  team  might  create  as  many  as  10  iterations  of  an  application  in  the  time  it  takes  to  generate  a  single  new  version  of  the  hardware  on  which  it  runs.  smart,  connected  products  offer  major  improvements  in  predictive  maintenance  and  service  productivity.  new  service  organizational  structures  and  delivery  processes  are  required  to  take  advantage  of  product  data  that  can  reveal  existing  and  future  problems  and  enable  companies  to  make  timely,  and  sometimes  remote,  repairs.  realtime  product  usage
__label__productinspection and  performance  data  allows  substantial  reductions  in  fieldservice  dispatch  costs  and  major  efficiencies  in  spareparts  inventory  control.  early  warnings  about  impending  failure  of  parts  or  components  can  reduce  breakdowns  and  allow  more  efficient  service  scheduling.  data  on  product  usage  and  performance  can  feed  insights  back  to  product  design,  so  that  firms  can  reduce  future  product  failures  and  associated  service  required.  product  usage  data  can  also  be  used  to  validate  warranty  claims  and  identify  warranty  agreement  violations.  smart,  connected  mining  machines  such  as  this  joy  global  longwall  shearer  in  some  cases,  firms  can  decrease  service  costs  by  replacing  physical  parts  with
__label__productinspection software  parts.  for  example,  glass  cockpit  lcd  displays  in  modern  aircraft,  which  can  be  repaired  or  upgraded  via  software,  have  replaced  electrical  and  mechanical  dials  and  gauges.  product  usage  data  also  enables  firms  to  better  design  for  servicethat  is,  reduce  the  complexity  or  placement  of  parts  that  are  prone  to  failure  in  order  to  simplify  repairs.  all  these  opportunities  change  the  service  activities  in  the  value  chain  substantially.  smart,  connected  products  allow  companies  to  form  new  kinds  of  relationships  with  customers,  requiring  new  marketing  practices  and  skill  sets.  as  companies  accumulate  and  analyze  product  usage  data,  they  gain  new  insights
__label__productinspection into  how  products  create  value  for  customers,  allowing  better  positioning  of  offerings  and  more  effective  communication  of  product  value  to  customers.  using  data  analytics  tools,  firms  can  segment  their  markets  in  moresophisticated  ways,  tailor  product  and  service  bundles  that  deliver  greater  value  to  each  segment,  and  price  those  bundles  to  capture  more  of  that  value.  this  approach  works  best  when  products  can  be  quickly  and  efficiently  tailored  at  low  marginal  cost  through  software  as  opposed  to  hardware  variation.  for  example,  whereas  john  deere  used  to  manufacture  multiple  engines  with  different  levels  of  horsepower  to  serve  different  customer  segments,  it  now
__label__productinspection can  modify  the  horsepower  rating  on  the  same  engine  using  software  alone.  smart,  connected  products  create  major  new  human  resource  requirements  and  challenges.  the  most  urgent  of  these  is  the  need  to  recruit  new  skill  sets,  many  of  which  are  in  high  demand.  engineering  departments,  traditionally  staffed  with  mechanical  engineers,  must  add  talent  in  software  development,  systems  engineering,  product  clouds,  big  data  analytics,  and  other  areas.  smart,  connected  products  create  the  need  for  robust  security  management  to  protect  the  data  flowing  to,  from,  and  between  products;  protect  products  against  unauthorized  use;  and  secure  access  between  the  product  technology  stack  and
__label__productinspection other  corporate  systems.  this  will  require  new  authentication  processes,  secure  storage  of  product  data,  protections  against  hackers  for  both  product  data  and  customer  data,  definition  and  control  of  access  privileges,  and  protections  for  products  themselves  from  hackers  and  unauthorized  use.  the  path  to  competitive  advantage  ultimately  rests  on  strategy.  our  research  reveals  that  in  a  smart,  connected  world  companies  face  10  new  strategic  choices.  each  choice  involves  tradeoffs,  and  each  must  reflect  a  companys  unique  circumstances.  the  choices  are  also  interdependent.  the  companys  entire  set  of  choices  must  reinforce  one  another  and  define  a  coherent  and  distinctive  overall  strategic  positioning
__label__productinspection for  the  company.  smart,  connected  products  dramatically  expand  the  range  of  potential  product  capabilities  and  features.  companies  may  be  tempted  to  add  as  many  new  features  as  possible,  especially  given  the  often  low  marginal  cost  of  adding  more  sensors  and  new  software  applications,  and  the  largely  fixed  costs  of  the  product  cloud  and  other  infrastructure.  but  just  because  a  company  can  offer  many  new  capabilities  does  not  mean  that  their  value  to  customers  exceeds  their  cost.  and  when  companies  get  into  a  features  and  capabilities  arms  race,  they  end  up  blurring  strategic  differences  and  creating  zerosum  competition.  more  a  tesla
__label__productinspection vehicle  in  need  of  repairs  can  autonomously  call  for  a  corrective  software  download,  or,  if  necessary,  send  a  notification  to  the  customer  with  an  invitation  for  a  valet  to  pick  up  the  car  and  deliver  it  to  a  tesla  facility.  how  should  a  company  determine  which  smart,  connected  capabilities  to  offer?  first,  it  must  decide  which  features  will  deliver  real  value  to  customers  relative  to  their  cost.  in  residential  water  heaters,  a.o.  smith  has  developed  capabilities  for  fault  monitoring  and  notification,  but  water  heaters  are  so  longlived  and  reliable  that  few  households  are  willing  to  pay  enough  for  these  features
__label__productinspection to  justify  their  current  cost.  consequently,  a.o.  smith  offers  them  as  options  on  only  a  few  models.  in  commercial  water  heaters  and  boilers,  however,  adoption  of  such  capabilities  is  high  and  rising.  the  value  of  remote  monitoring  and  operation  to  commercial  customers  that  often  cannot  operate  without  heat  and  hot  water  is  high  relative  to  their  cost,  and  so  these  features  are  becoming  standard.  note  that  the  cost  of  incorporating  smart,  connected  product  features  will  tend  to  fall  over  time,  as  is  the  case  in  water  heaters  and  boilers.  when  deciding  what  features  to  offer,  then,  companies  must  continually  revisit
__label__productinspection the  value  equation.  second,  the  value  of  features  or  capabilities  will  vary  by  market  segment,  and  so  the  selection  of  features  a  company  offers  will  depend  on  what  segments  it  chooses  to  serve.  schneider  electric,  for  example,  makes  building  products  as  well  as  integrated  building  management  solutions  that  gather  volumes  of  data  about  energy  consumption  and  other  building  performance  metrics.  for  one  segment  of  customers,  schneiders  solution  involves  remote  equipment  monitoring,  alerts,  and  advisory  services  in  reducing  energy  use  and  other  costs.  for  the  segment  of  customers  that  want  a  fully  outsourced  solution,  however,  schneider  actually  takes  over  remote  control
__label__productinspection of  equipment  to  minimize  energy  consumption  on  customers  behalf.  third,  a  company  should  incorporate  those  capabilities  and  features  that  reinforce  its  competitive  positioning.  a  company  competing  with  a  highend  strategy  can  often  reinforce  differentiation  through  extensive  features,  while  a  lowcost  competitor  may  choose  to  include  only  the  most  basic  features  that  affect  core  product  performance  and  that  lower  the  cost  of  operation.  for  example,  a.o.  smiths  lochinvar  boiler  unit,  which  competes  using  a  highly  differentiated  strategy,  has  made  extensive  smart,  connected  product  features  standard  on  its  core  products.  in  contrast,  rolex,  the  luxury  watch  maker,  has  decided  that  smart,  connected
__label__productinspection capabilities  are  not  an  area  in  which  it  will  compete.  once  a  company  has  decided  which  capabilities  to  offer,  it  must  decide  whether  the  enabling  technology  for  each  feature  should  be  embedded  in  the  product  raising  the  cost  of  every  product,  delivered  through  the  product  cloud,  or  both.  in  addition  to  cost,  a  number  of  factors  should  be  taken  into  consideration.  a  feature  that  requires  quick  response  times,  such  as  a  safety  shutdown  in  a  nuclear  power  plant,  requires  that  the  software  be  embedded  in  the  physical  product.  this  also  reduces  the  risk  that  lost  or  degraded  connectivity  slows  down
__label__productinspection response.  products  that  are  fully  automated,  such  as  antilock  brakes,  usually  require  that  greater  functionality  be  embedded  into  the  device.  embedding  software  in  the  product  minimizes  dependence  on  network  availability  and  the  amount  of  data  that  must  flow  from  the  product  to  cloudbased  applications,  lowering  the  risk  that  sensitive  or  confidential  data  will  be  compromised  during  transmission.  companies  that  operate  products  in  remote  or  hazardous  locations  can  mitigate  the  associated  dangers  and  costs  by  hosting  functionality  in  the  product  cloud.  as  discussed  above,  thermo  fishers  chemical  analyzers,  used  in  hazardous  or  toxic  environments,  have  cloudbased  capabilities  and  connectivity  that  enable
__label__productinspection the  instantaneous  transmission  of  contamination  data  and  allow  the  immediate  initiation  of  mitigation  efforts.  more  if  the  products  user  interface  is  complex  and  is  changed  frequently,  the  interface  may  be  best  located  in  the  cloud.  the  cloud  offers  the  ability  to  deliver  a  much  richer  user  experience  and  potentially  to  take  advantage  of  an  existing,  familiar,  and  robust  user  interface  like  a  smartphone.  cloudbased  applications  and  interfaces  allow  companies  to  make  product  changes  and  upgrades  easily  and  automatically.  home  audio  equipment  maker  sonos,  a  smart,  connected  products  pioneer,  takes  advantage  of  cloudbased  capability  to  reinvent  home  audio  for  the  digital
__label__productinspection age,  putting  a  premium  on  convenience,  variety  of  music,  and  ease  of  use.  the  companys  wireless  systems  place  both  the  music  source  and  the  user  interface  in  the  cloud,  enabling  sonos  to  simplify  its  products  physical  design:  the  portable  device,  which  is  controlled  from  a  smartphone,  contains  only  the  amplifier  and  speaker.  with  this  offering,  sonos  attempted  to  disrupt  the  home  audio  market.  the  tradeoff?  wireless  streamed  audio  systems  do  not  deliver  the  level  of  sound  quality  that  true  audiophiles  demand.  competitors  such  as  bose  will  make  different  choices  and  tradeoffs  to  secure  their  competitive  differentiation.  we  believe  that  as
__label__productinspection smart,  connected  products  evolve,  more  humanmachine  interface  capabilities  may  well  move  out  of  the  product  and  into  the  cloud.  however,  the  complexity  facing  users  in  operating  these  interfaces  will  increase.  user  interfaces  may  often  overshoot  in  complexity,  and  user  backlash  may  drive  firms  to  restore  simpler,  easytouse  interfaces  for  common  functions,  including  on/off  controls.  smart,  connected  products  involve  multiple  types  of  functionality  and  services,  and  are  often  systems  encompassing  multiple  products.  a  closed  system  approach  aims  to  have  customers  purchase  the  entire  smart,  connected  product  system  from  a  single  manufacturer.  key  interfaces  are  proprietary,  and  only  chosen  parties  gain  access.
__label__productinspection the  operating  data  that  ge  gathers  from  its  aircraft  engines,  for  example,  is  available  only  to  the  airlines  operating  the  engines.  an  open  system,  by  contrast,  enables  the  end  customer  to  assemble  the  parts  of  the  solutionboth  the  products  involved  and  the  platform  that  ties  the  system  togetherfrom  different  companies.  here,  the  interfaces  enabling  access  to  each  part  of  the  system  are  open  or  standardized,  allowing  outside  players  to  create  new  applications.  when  smart  wind  turbines  are  networked,  software  can  adjust  the  blades  on  each  one  to  minimize  impact  on  the  efficiency  of  turbines  nearby.  closed  systems  create  competitive  advantage
__label__productinspection by  allowing  a  company  to  control  and  optimize  the  design  of  all  parts  of  the  system  relative  to  one  another.  the  company  maintains  control  over  technology  and  data  as  well  as  the  direction  of  development  of  the  product  and  the  product  cloud.  producers  of  system  components  are  restricted  from  accessing  a  closed  system  or  are  required  to  license  the  right  to  integrate  their  products  into  it.  a  closed  approach  may  result  in  one  manufacturers  system  becoming  the  de  facto  industry  standard,  enabling  this  company  to  capture  the  maximum  value.  a  closed  approach  requires  significant  investment  and  works  best  when  a
__label__productinspection single  manufacturer  has  a  dominant  position  in  the  industry  that  can  be  leveraged  to  control  the  supply  of  all  parts  of  the  smart,  connected  product  system.  if  either  philips  healthcare  or  ge  healthcare  were  the  dominant  manufacturer  of  medical  imaging  equipment,  for  example,  it  could  drive  a  closed  approach  in  which  it  could  sell  medical  imaging  management  systems  that  included  only  its  own  or  partners  equipment  to  hospitals.  however,  neither  company  has  the  clout  to  restrict  hospitals  choice  of  other  manufacturers  equipment,  so  both  companies  imaging  system  platforms  interface  with  other  manufacturers  machines.  a  fully  open  system  enables  any  entity
__label__productinspection to  participate  in  and  interface  with  the  system.  when  philips  lighting  introduced  the  hue  smart,  connected  lightbulb,  for  example,  it  included  a  basic  smartphone  application  that  allowed  users  to  control  the  color  and  intensity  of  individual  bulbs.  philips  also  published  the  application  programming  interface,  which  led  independent  software  developers  to  quickly  release  dozens  of  applications  that  extended  the  utility  of  the  hue  bulbs,  boosting  sales.  the  open  approach  enables  a  faster  rate  of  applications  development  and  system  innovation  as  multiple  entities  contribute.  it  can  also  result  in  a  de  facto  industry  standard,  but  one  from  which  no  company  gains  a
__label__productinspection proprietary  benefit.  more  while  a  closed  system  is  possible  for  individual  product  systems,  it  is  often  impractical  for  systems  of  systems.  whirlpool,  for  example,  realizes  that  its  strong  position  in  home  appliances  will  not  be  sufficient  to  become  the  leader  in  the  connected  home,  which  includes  not  only  connected  appliances  but  also  automated  lighting,  hvac,  entertainment,  and  security.  therefore,  whirlpool  designs  its  appliances  to  be  readily  connectable  to  the  variety  of  home  automation  systems  on  the  market,  seeking  to  retain  proprietary  control  only  over  its  product  features.  a  hybrid  approach,  in  which  a  subset  of  functionality  is  open  but  the
__label__productinspection company  controls  access  to  full  capabilities,  occurs  in  industries  like  medical  devices,  where  manufacturers  support  an  industry  standard  interface  but  offer  greater  functionality  only  to  customers.  over  time,  closed  approaches  become  more  challenging  as  technology  spreads  and  customers  resist  limits  on  choice.  babolats  play  pure  drive  product  system  puts  sensors  and  connectivity  in  the  tennis  racket  handle,  allowing  users  to  track  and  analyze  ball  speed,  spin,  and  impact  location  to  improve  their  game.  developing  the  technology  stack  for  smart,  connected  products  requires  significant  investment  in  specialized  skills,  technologies,  and  infrastructure  that  have  not  been  typically  present  in  manufacturing  companies.  many
__label__productinspection of  these  skills  are  scarce  and  in  high  demand.  a  company  must  choose  which  layers  of  technology  to  develop  and  maintain  inhouse  and  which  to  outsource  to  suppliers  and  partners.  in  utilizing  outside  partners,  it  must  decide  whether  to  pursue  custom  development  of  tailored  solutions  or  license  offtheshelf,  bestofbreed  solutions  at  each  level.  our  research  suggests  that  the  most  successful  companies  choose  a  judicious  combination  of  both.  companies  that  develop  smart,  connected  products  inhouse  internalize  key  skills  and  infrastructure  and  retain  greater  control  over  features,  functionality,  and  product  data.  they  may  also  capture  firstmover  advantages  and  the  ability  to  influence
__label__productinspection the  direction  of  technology  development.  the  company  gets  on  its  own,  steeper  learning  curve,  which  can  help  maintain  its  competitive  advantage.  for  example,  while  software  skills  are  not  well  developed  in  most  manufacturing  companies,  jeff  immelt  recently  said  that  every  industrial  company  will  become  a  software  company.  the  nature  of  technology  for  smart,  connected  products  makes  it  clear  why  that  might  well  be  true  and  why  building  internal  software  capability  is  crucial.  early  pioneers  agco  and  deere  have  both  taken  a  largely  inhouse  route  to  develop  smart  farm  equipment  solutions  for  those  reasons.  ge  has  created  a  major  software  development

__label__productinspection slowing  down  their  development  time  line.  but  outsourcing  can  create  new  costs,  as  suppliers  and  partners  demand  a  larger  share  of  the  value  created.  companies  that  rely  on  partners  also  compromise  their  ability  to  differentiate  going  forward,  and  their  ability  to  build  and  retain  the  inhouse  expertise  required  to  set  overall  product  design  strategy,  manage  innovation,  and  choose  vendors  well.  in  making  these  buildversusbuy  choices,  companies  should  identify  those  technology  layers  that  offer  the  greatest  opportunities  for  product  insight,  future  innovation,  and  competitive  advantage,  and  outsource  those  that  will  become  commoditized  or  advance  too  quickly.  for  example,  most  companies  should
__label__productinspection strive  to  maintain  solid  internal  capabilities  in  areas  such  as  device  design,  the  user  interface,  systems  engineering,  data  analytics,  and  rapid  product  application  development.  more  these  choices  will  evolve  over  time.  in  the  early  stages  of  smart,  connected  products  technology,  the  number  of  capable  and  robust  suppliers  has  been  limited,  and  so  companies  have  been  faced  with  the  imperative  of  inhouse  or  custom  development.  already,  however,  bestofbreed  vendors  with  turnkey  connectivity  solutions  and  product  clouds,  secure  highperformance  application  platforms,  and  readytouse  data  analytics  are  emerging.  this  makes  it  increasingly  challenging  for  inhouse  efforts  to  keep  up  and  can  turn  an
__label__productinspection early  lead  into  a  disadvantage.  ralph  laurens  polo  tech  shirt,  available  in  2015,  streams  distance  covered,  calories  burned,  movement  intensity,  heart  rate,  and  other  data  to  the  wearers  mobile  device.  product  data  is  fundamental  to  value  creation  and  competitive  advantage  in  smart,  connected  products.  but  collecting  data  requires  sensors,  which  add  cost  to  the  product,  as  does  transmitting,  storing,  securing,  and  analyzing  this  data.  companies  may  also  need  to  obtain  rights  to  the  data,  adding  complexity  and  cost.  to  determine  which  types  of  data  provide  sufficient  value  relative  to  cost,  the  firm  must  consider  questions  such  as:  how  does  each
__label__productinspection type  of  data  create  tangible  value  for  functionality?  for  efficiency  in  the  value  chain?  will  the  data  help  the  company  understand  and  improve  how  the  broader  product  system  is  performing  over  time?  how  often  does  the  data  need  to  be  collected  to  optimize  its  usefulness,  and  how  long  should  it  be  retained?  companies  must  also  consider  the  product  integrity,  security,  or  privacy  risks  for  each  type  of  data  and  the  associated  cost.  the  less  sensitive  data  a  company  collects,  the  lower  the  risk  of  breaches  and  transmission  disruptions.  when  security  requirements  are  high,  companies  will  need  capabilities  to  protect  the
__label__productinspection data  and  limit  transmission  risk  by  storing  data  in  the  product  itself.  we  will  discuss  security  more  extensively  in  part  two  of  this  series.  the  types  of  data  a  company  chooses  to  collect  and  analyze  also  depend  on  its  positioning.  if  the  companys  strategy  is  focused  on  leading  in  product  performance  or  minimizing  service  cost,  it  must  usually  capture  extensive  immediate  value  data  that  can  be  leveraged  in  real  time.  this  is  especially  important  for  complex,  expensive  products  for  which  downtime  is  costly,  such  as  wind  turbines  or  jet  engines.  for  companies  seeking  leadership  in  the  product  system,  there  is
__label__productinspection a  need  to  invest  in  capturing  and  analyzing  moreextensive  data  across  multiple  products  and  the  external  environment,  even  for  products  the  company  does  not  produce.  for  example  a  smart,  connected  product  system  might  need  to  capture  traffic  data,  weather  conditions,  and  fuel  prices  at  different  locations  for  an  entire  fleet  of  vehicles.  medtronics  implanted  digital  blood  glucose  meter  connects  wirelessly  to  a  monitoring  and  display  device  and  can  alert  patients  to  trends  in  glucose  levels  requiring  attention.  different  strategies  involve  different  datacapture  choices.  nest,  which  aims  to  lead  in  energy  efficiency  and  energy  cost,  gathers  extensive  data  on  both  product
__label__productinspection usage  and  peak  demand  across  the  energy  grid.  this  has  enabled  the  rush  hour  rewards  program,  which  raises  residential  customers  air  conditioning  thermostat  temperature  to  reduce  energy  use  during  peak  demand  periods  and  precools  a  home  before  peak  demand  begins.  by  partnering  with  energy  providers,  securing  the  data  they  provide,  and  integrating  it  with  customer  data,  nest  enables  customers  to  earn  discounts  or  credits  from  their  energy  provider  and  to  use  less  energy  when  everyone  else  is  using  more.  as  a  company  chooses  which  data  to  gather  and  analyze,  it  must  determine  how  to  secure  rights  to  the  data  and
__label__productinspection manage  data  access.  the  key  is  who  actually  owns  the  data.  the  manufacturer  may  own  the  product,  but  product  usage  data  potentially  belongs  to  the  customer.  for  example,  who  is  the  rightful  owner  of  the  data  streaming  from  a  smart,  connected  aircraft  enginethe  engine  supplier,  the  airframe  manufacturer,  or  the  airline  that  owns  and  operates  the  planes?  there  is  a  range  of  options  for  establishing  data  rights  for  smart,  connected  products.  companies  may  pursue  outright  ownership  of  product  data,  or  seek  joint  ownership.  there  are  also  various  levels  of  usage  rights,  including  ndas,  the  right  to  share  the  data,  or
__label__productinspection the  right  to  sell  it.  firms  must  determine  their  approach  to  transparency  in  data  collection  and  use.  rights  to  data  can  be  laid  out  in  an  explicit  agreement  or  buried  in  small  print  or  hardtounderstand  boilerplate  documents.  although  we  are  seeing  the  early  stages  of  a  movement  toward  more  transparency  in  data  gathering  across  industries,  data  disclosure  and  ownership  standards  often  have  yet  to  be  established.  more  another  option  for  handling  data  rights  and  access  includes  the  establishment  of  a  datasharing  framework  with  component  suppliers  for  providing  information  about  the  components  condition  and  performance  but  not  about  its  location.  limiting
__label__productinspection suppliers  access  to  data,  however,  could  reduce  potential  benefits  if  the  supplier  lacks  a  full  understanding  of  how  products  are  being  used,  slowing  innovation.  customers  and  users  want  a  say  in  these  choices.  some  customers  today  are  much  more  willing  than  others  to  share  data  on  their  product  use.  for  example,  part  of  fitbits  value  proposition  is  its  ability  to  share  via  social  media  the  personal  fitness  information  it  collects.  but  not  every  customer  wants  to  share  this  data.  likewise,  cautious  drivers  may  be  willing  to  share  data  on  their  driving  habits  with  insurance  or  rental  car  companies  as  a
__label__productinspection way  to  lower  premiums  or  fees,  but  others  may  resist.  firms  will  need  to  provide  a  clear  value  proposition  to  customers  to  encourage  them  to  share  usage  or  other  data.  as  consumers  become  more  aware  of  the  value  that  data  generates  across  the  value  chain,  they  will  become  more  active  and  demanding  participants  in  decisions  about  what  data  is  collected,  how  it  is  used,  and  who  benefits.  today  its  common  to  see  click  through  agreements  giving  broad  consent  to  collect  product  data  the  first  time  a  smart,  connected  product  is  used.  this  consent  allows  companies  to  indiscriminately  collect  product  data
__label__productinspection and  use  it  with  few  constraints.  in  time  we  expect  that  morestringent  contractual  frameworks  and  mechanisms  governing  those  rights  will  emerge  to  define  and  protect  intellectual  property  associated  with  smart,  connected  product  data.  it  behooves  companies  to  get  ahead  of  this  trend,  especially  on  the  product  data  they  truly  need  to  collect  in  order  to  drive  value.  careful  stewardship  of  data  will  also  be  essential,  especially  in  highly  regulated  industries  such  as  medical  devices.  regulatory  standards  for  data  access  and  security  are  already  in  place  in  many  such  fields.  biotronik  has  created  infrastructure  that  allows  it  to  securely  gather  patient
__label__productinspection information,  such  as  arrhythmia  events  or  pacemaker  battery  status,  and  share  it  only  with  a  specified  audiencethe  patients  physician.  regardless  of  the  industry,  however,  stewardship  of  data  will  be  an  essential  capability,  and  data  breaches  will  lead  to  serious  consequences  regardless  of  who  is  at  fault.  ongoing  security  risk  is  part  of  the  business  case  for  which  data  to  collect  and  how  to  manage  it.  smart,  connected  products  enable  firms  to  maintain  direct  and  deep  customer  relationships,  which  can  reduce  the  need  for  distribution  channel  partners.  companies  can  also  diagnose  product  performance  problems  and  failures  and  sometimes  make  repairs  remotely,
__label__productinspection reducing  reliance  on  service  partners.  by  minimizing  the  role  of  the  middlemen,  companies  can  potentially  capture  new  revenue  and  boost  margins.  they  can  also  improve  their  knowledge  of  customer  needs,  strengthen  brand  awareness,  and  boost  loyalty  by  educating  customers  more  directly  about  product  value.  tesla,  for  example,  has  disrupted  the  status  quo  in  the  automotive  industry  by  selling  its  cars  directly  to  consumers  rather  than  through  a  traditional  dealer  network.  this  has  simplified  the  firms  pricingconsumers  pay  full  sticker  price,  avoiding  the  haggling  common  at  dealershipsgreatly  improving  customer  satisfaction.  by  eliminating  thirdparty  involvement  in  repairs,  tesla  captures  revenue  and  deepens
__label__productinspection its  relationship  with  customers.  the  firm  transmits  software  upgrades  to  its  cars,  continually  improving  the  customer  experience  and  giving  drivers  the  equivalent  of  the  new  car  smell  with  each  update.  when  monitoring  detects  that  a  tesla  vehicle  is  due  for  repairs,  the  car  either  autonomously  calls  for  a  remote  repair  via  software  or  sends  a  notification  to  the  customer  with  an  invitation  to  request  that  a  valet  deliver  it  to  the  tesla  facility.  the  firm  was  recently  rated  number  one  in  customer  satisfaction  by  while  disintermediation  has  definite  advantages,  some  level  of  physical  proximity  to  customers  is  still  required  and
__label__productinspection desirable  in  most  industries.  customers  must  take  delivery  of  and  sometimes  install  a  physical  product,  and  some  types  of  service  visits  are  still  necessary.  in  addition,  customers  may  have  strong  relationships  with  resellers  and  channels  that  offer  them  a  broader  product  line  and  deep  and  local  fieldbased  expertise.  when  manufacturers  diminish  the  role  of  valuable  channel  partners,  they  risk  losing  them  to  competitors  whose  strategy  is  to  embrace  partners.  also,  assuming  roles  formerly  handled  by  partnerssuch  as  direct  selling  or  servicecan  be  challenging,  involving  high  startup  costs  and  major  new  investments  in  value  chain  functions  such  as  sales,  logistics,  inventory,
__label__productinspection and  infrastructure.  the  choice  of  whether  or  not  to  disintermediate  a  channel  or  service  partner  will  depend  in  large  part  on  the  type  of  partner  network  the  firm  manages.  do  partners  simply  distribute  products,  or  are  they  critical  to  delivering  training  and  service  in  the  field?  what  percentage  of  partner  activities  can  be  replaced  through  smart,  connected  product  capabilities?  do  customers  understand  the  value  of  eliminating  the  middleman?  do  customers  understand  that  traditional  relationships  with  established  channels  are  no  longer  necessary  and  involve  extra  cost?  smart,  connected  products  offer  a  rich  new  set  of  value  creation  and  growth  opportunities.  however,
__label__productinspection efforts  to  seize  those  opportunities  will  not  be  without  challenges.  some  of  the  greatest  strategic  risks  include  the  following:  just  because  a  feature  is  now  possible  does  not  mean  there  is  a  clear  value  proposition  for  the  customer.  adding  enhanced  capabilities  and  options  can  reach  the  point  of  diminishing  returns,  due  to  the  cost  and  complexity  of  use.  smart,  connected  products  open  major  new  gateways  to  corporate  systems  and  data,  requiring  steppedup  network  security,  device  and  sensor  security,  and  information  encryption.  new  competitors  offering  products  with  smart,  connected  capabilities  such  as  connectivity  and  embedded  software  or  performance  or  servicebased  business
__label__productinspection models  can  emerge  quickly  and  reshape  competition  and  industry  boundaries.  moving  slowly  enables  competitors  and  new  entrants  to  gain  a  foothold,  begin  capturing  and  analyzing  data,  and  start  moving  up  the  learning  curve.  the  shift  to  smart,  connected  products  will  demand  new  technologies,  skills,  and  processes  throughout  the  value  chain  for  example,  big  data  analytics,  systems  engineering,  and  software  application  development.  a  realistic  assessment  about  which  capabilities  should  be  developed  inhouse  and  which  should  be  developed  by  new  partners  is  crucial.  more  manufacturers  have  traditionally  focused  on  producing  a  physical  good  and  capturing  value  by  transferring  ownership  of  the  good
__label__productinspection to  the  customer  through  a  sales  transaction.  the  owner  is  then  responsible  for  the  costs  of  servicing  the  product  and  other  costs  of  use,  while  bearing  the  risks  of  downtime  and  other  product  failures  and  defects  not  covered  by  warranties.  smart,  connected  products  allow  the  radical  alteration  of  this  longstanding  business  model.  the  manufacturer,  through  access  to  product  data  and  the  ability  to  anticipate,  reduce,  and  repair  failures,  has  an  unprecedented  ability  to  affect  product  performance  and  optimize  service.  this  opens  up  a  spectrum  of  new  business  models  for  capturing  value,  from  a  version  of  the  traditional  ownership  model  where
__label__productinspection the  customer  benefits  from  the  new  service  efficiencies  to  the  productasaservice  model  in  which  the  manufacturer  retains  ownership  and  takes  full  responsibility  for  the  costs  of  product  operation  and  service  in  return  for  an  ongoing  charge.  customers  pay  as  they  go,  not  up  front.  here,  the  value  of  product  performance  improvements  that  reduce  operating  cost  such  as  better  energy  efficiency  and  service  efficiencies  are  captured  by  the  manufacturer.  smart,  connected  products  create  a  dilemma  for  manufacturers,  particularly  those  that  make  complex,  longlived  products  for  which  parts  and  service  generate  significant  revenue  and  often  disproportionate  profit.  whirlpool,  for  example,  currently  has
__label__productinspection a  healthy  business  selling  spare  parts  and  service  contractsa  model  that  can  dull  incentives  to  make  products  more  reliable,  more  durable,  and  easier  to  fix.  if,  instead,  whirlpool  moved  to  a  productasaservice  model,  in  which  it  maintained  ownership  of  the  product  and  the  customer  simply  paid  for  the  use  of  the  machine,  the  economic  incentives  would  be  turned  upside  down.  the  profitability  of  productasaservice  models  depends  on  the  pricing  and  terms  of  contracts,  which  are  a  function  of  bargaining  power.  productasaservice  models  can  increase  buyers  power,  because  customers  may  be  able  to  switch  after  the  contract  period  if  the  product
__label__productinspection is  not  embedded  as  with  an  elevator,  unlike  with  perpetual  ownership.  product  sharing,  a  variation  of  the  productasaservice  model,  focuses  on  more  efficient  utilization  of  products  that  are  used  intermittently.  customers  pay  for  the  use  of  the  product  such  as  cars  or  bikes  when  they  need  it,  and  the  company  such  as  zipcar  or  hubway  is  responsible  for  everything  else.  product  sharing  is  spreading  to  nonmobile  products  such  as  houses.  companies  can  also  pursue  hybrid  models  between  the  extremes  of  productasaservice  and  conventional  ownership,  such  as  product  sales  bundled  with  warranty  or  service  contracts,  or  product  sales  bundled  with  performancebased
__label__productinspection contracts.  service  contracts  allow  the  manufacturer  to  keep  service  inhouse  and  capture  more  of  the  value  from  service  efficiencies.  in  a  performancebased  contract,  the  manufacturer  sells  the  product  along  with  a  contract  that  promises  that  the  product  will  perform  to  certain  specifications  such  as  percentage  of  uptime.  here,  ownership  is  transferred,  but  the  manufacturer  maintains  responsibility  and  bears  the  risk  of  product  performance.  the  companys  wireless  music  systems  place  the  user  interface  in  the  cloud,  enabling  users  to  control  the  portable  device  from  a  smartphone.  companies  may  find  that  the  data  they  accumulate  from  smart,  connected  products  is  valuable  to
__label__productinspection entities  besides  traditional  customers.  companies  may  also  discover  that  they  can  capture  additional  data,  beyond  what  they  need  to  optimize  product  value,  that  is  valuable  to  other  entities.  in  either  case,  this  may  lead  to  new  services  or  even  new  businesses.  data  about  the  performance  of  a  products  components,  for  example,  could  be  valuable  to  suppliers  of  those  components.  data  about  driving  conditions  or  delays  gathered  by  a  fleet  of  vehicles  could  be  valuable  to  other  drivers,  to  the  operators  of  logistical  systems,  or  to  road  repair  crews.  data  about  driving  characteristics  could  be  valuable  to  fleet  operators  or  insurance
__label__productinspection companies.  more  again,  in  choosing  how  to  capture  new  value  from  product  data,  companies  must  consider  the  likely  reaction  of  core  customers.  while  some  of  them  may  not  care  how  their  data  is  used,  others  may  feel  strongly  about  data  privacy  and  reuse.  companies  will  need  to  identify  mechanisms  to  provide  valuable  data  to  third  parties  without  alienating  customers.  for  example,  a  company  might  not  sell  individual  customer  data  but  rather  blinded  or  aggregate  data  on  purchasing  patterns,  driving  habits,  or  energy  usage.  smart,  connected  products  not  only  transform  existing  products  but  often  broaden  industry  boundaries.  products  that  have  been
__label__productinspection separate  and  distinct  can  become  parts  of  optimized  systems  of  related  products,  or  components  of  systems  of  systems.  shifting  boundaries  mean  that  companies  that  have  been  industry  leaders  for  decades  may  find  themselves  playing  more  of  a  supporting  role  in  a  broader  landscape.  the  emergence  of  product  systems  and  systems  of  systems  raises  at  least  two  types  of  strategic  choices  about  company  scope.  the  first  is  whether  a  company  should  expand  into  related  products  or  other  parts  of  the  system  of  systems.  the  second  is  whether  a  company  should  seek  to  provide  the  platform  that  connects  the  related  products  and
__label__productinspection information,  even  if  it  does  not  make  or  control  all  the  parts.  companies  may  be  tempted  to  enter  into  related  products  in  order  to  capture  the  big  opportunity,  but  entry  into  related  products  always  involves  risk  and  the  need  for  new  capabilities.  companies  must  identify  a  clear  value  proposition  before  entering.  expanding  product  scope  will  be  most  attractive  where  there  are  major  performance  improvement  opportunities  through  codesigning  the  related  products  to  optimize  the  system.  alternatively,  if  optimization  is  not  dependent  on  individual  product  designs,  a  company  may  be  better  off  sticking  to  its  knitting  and  providing  open  connectivity  to  related
__label__productinspection products  produced  by  others.  success  is  less  a  function  of  traditional  product  design  than  systems  engineering.  smart,  connected  products  will  give  rise  to  the  next  era  of  itdriven  productivity  growth  at  a  time  when  the  impact  of  earlier  waves  of  it  has  largely  played  itself  out.  companies  whose  products  and  associated  technological  capabilities  are  central  to  overall  product  system  operation  and  performance,  such  as  joy  globals  mining  machines,  will  be  in  the  best  position  to  enter  related  products  and  integrate  the  system.  manufacturers  that  produce  less  systemcritical  machines,  such  as  the  trucks  that  move  the  material  extracted  from  underground,  will
__label__productinspection have  less  capability  and  credibility  in  customers  eyes  to  take  on  a  broader  system  provider  role.  users  can  control  philips  lighting  hue  lightbulbs  via  smartphone,  turning  them  on  and  off,  programming  them  to  blink  if  they  detect  an  intruder,  or  dimming  them  slowly  at  night.  the  choice  of  whether  or  not  to  develop  the  technology  platform  that  connects  a  product  system  or  system  of  systems  depends  on  some  related  questions.  the  first  is  whether  the  company  can  assemble  the  necessary  it  skills  and  technology,  which  are  quite  different  from  those  required  in  product  design  and  manufacturing.  another  key  question  is
__label__productinspection where  system  optimization  takes  place.  inside  product  optimization  involves  integrating  individual  product  designs  so  that  products  work  better  together.  outside  product  optimization  takes  place  through  the  algorithms  that  connect  products  and  other  information,  where  products  themselves  are  modular.  inside  product  optimization  creates  the  strongest  rationale  for  expanding  into  related  products  and  offering  a  proprietary  platform.  outside  product  optimization  favors  an  open  platform,  and  the  platform  may  be  offered  by  a  company  that  does  not  produce  products  at  all.  carrier  corporation  offers  an  example  of  these  choices.  it  has  a  100year  history  of  innovation  in  the  design  of  a  full  range
__label__productinspection of  hvac  equipment  such  as  furnaces,  air  conditioners,  heat  pumps,  humidifiers,  and  ventilators.  carrier  optimizes  its  hvac  product  system  performance  by  integrating  individual  designs  across  products,  and  its  smart  infinity  heating  and  cooling  system  platform  connects  them.  however,  hvac  is  part  of  a  broader  home  automation  system.  carrier  has  not  entered  other  product  areas  within  home  automation  because  of  the  need  for  very  different  capabilities.  rather,  its  infinity  platform  provides  interfaces  to  allow  the  hvac  product  family  to  be  integrated  into  the  system  of  systems.  finally,  as  smart,  connected  products  expand  industry  scope  and  the  boundaries  of  competition,  many  companies
__label__productinspection will  need  to  rethink  their  corporate  purpose.  the  focus  is  shifting  to  the  broader  need  companies  meet,  rather  than  their  traditional  product  definition.  for  example,  trane  has  moved  from  seeing  itself  as  an  hvac  equipment  producer  to  a  company  that  makes  highperformance  buildings  better  for  everyone  inside.  as  products  continue  to  communicate  and  collaborate  in  networks,  which  are  expanding  both  in  number  and  diversity,  many  companies  will  have  to  reexamine  their  core  mission  and  value  proposition.  more  in  each  of  these  dimensions  of  strategy  but  ensure  that  each  choice  is  consistent  with  and  reinforces  the  others.  for  example,  a  company
__label__productinspection pursuing  product  system  leadership  will  enter  related  product  categories,  pursue  inside  product  design  integration,  capture  extensive  product  usage  data,  and  develop  more  intensive  internal  capabilities  across  the  technology  stack.  in  contrast,  a  company  that  focuses  on  a  single  part  of  a  product  system  will  need  to  become  bestofbreed  in  terms  of  features  and  functionality  and  provide  transparent  and  open  interfaces  so  that  its  product  can  be  readily  integrated  into  and  becomes  a  valuable  part  of  other  companies  systems  and  platforms.  ultimately,  competitive  success  will  arise  not  by  imitating  rivals  but  by  defining  a  distinctive  value  proposition  that  the  company  can

__label__productinspection will  create  step  function  improvements  in  product  capability  and  performance  but  will  radically  improve  our  ability  to  meet  many  business  and  human  needs.  across  many  fields,  products  will  be  far  more  efficient,  effective,  safe,  reliable,  and  more  fully  utilized,  while  conserving  scarce  natural  resources  such  as  energy,  water,  and  raw  materials.  this  opportunity  to  drive  rapid  innovation  and  economic  growth,  and  with  it  a  return  to  prosperity  growth,  comes  none  too  soon.  the  past  decade  has  been  characterized  by  internal  cost  reduction,  cautious  investment,  higher  corporate  profitability,  rising  ma,  and  muted  innovation  across  large  parts  of  the  economy.  this  path

__label__productinspection to  other  devices  within  the  vehicle  itself  and/or  devices,  networks,  and  services  outside  the  vehicle,  including  other  vehicles,  the  home,  office,  or  surrounding  infrastructure.  the  way  in  which  we  interact  with  our  vehicles  is  rapidly  changing,  driven  by  the  increased  use  of  mobile  devices,  cloudbased  services,  and  advanced  automotive  technology  ,  ,  ,  .  in  particular,  the  machine  interface  between  automobiles  and  humans  must  allow  for  the  seamless  integration  of  several  types  of  personal  devices  that  support  various  software  and  hardware  standards  to  allow  drivers  to  use  their  smartphones  while  driving.  therefore,  the  future  vehicle  will  have  the  capability  of
__label__productinspection surround  sensing,  and  can  form  connections  between  vehicles,  as  well  as  between  vehicles  and  surrounding  infrastructure.  this  will  lead  to  increased  requirements  for  information  and  communication  technology,  and  ultimately,  cars  will  become  a  part  of  the  internet  in  the  near  future  .  the  future  mobility  of  the  automotive  industry  requires  new  applications  and  technologies  related  to  electric  powering,  automation,  and  connected  services  .  internetintegrated  vehicles  are  already  on  the  roads,  and  it  is  predicted  that  the  percentage  of  internetintegrated  vehicle  services  will  jump  from  the  current  figure  of  10  to  90  by  2020  .  the  advances  in  cloud  computing  and
__label__productinspection the  internet  of  things  iot  have  provided  a  promising  opportunity  in  vehicular  software  and  services  in  the  automotive  domain.  academia  and  the  automotive  industry  are  responding  by  exploring  reliable  and  efficient  connectivity  solutions  ,  ,  ,  .  in  recent  years,  the  demand  for  highspeed  mobile  internet  services  has  dramatically  increased;  hence,  the  requirements  and  market  demand  for  iot  deviceconnected  cars  will  continuously  increase.  however,  iotbased  vehicular  data  clouds  must  be  efficient,  scalable,  secure,  and  reliable  before  they  can  be  deployed  on  a  large  scale.  existing  algorithms  and  mechanisms  are  unsatisfactory  to  meet  the  necessary  requirements  simultaneously.  iotbased  vehicular  data  clouds
__label__productinspection are  expected  to  be  the  backbone  of  the  system,  with  the  goal  of  making  driving  safer  and  more  enjoyable.  however,  research  into  integrating  the  iot  with  vehicular  data  clouds  is  still  in  its  infancy  and  the  existing  study  into  this  topic  is  highly  insufficient.  to  ensure  that  vehicular  data  clouds  are  useful,  numerous  services  such  as  road  navigation,  traffic  management,  remote  monitoring,  urban  surveillance,  information,  entertainment,  and  business  intelligence  need  to  be  developed  and  deployed  based  on  vehicular  data  clouds  ,  ,  ,  ,  .  numerous  challenges  still  exist  such  as  security,  privacy,  scalability,  reliability,  quality  of  service,  and  the
__label__productinspection lack  of  global  standards  ,  .  due  to  the  complexity  involved  in  implementing  vehicular  clouds  and  integrating  various  devices  and  systems  with  vehicular  clouds,  a  systematic  approach  and  collaboration  among  academia,  the  automobile  companies,  law  enforcement,  government  authorities,  standardization  groups,  and  cloud  service  providers  is  needed  to  address  these  challenges.  though  there  are  many  challenges,  iot  and  cloud  computing  provide  tremendous  opportunities  for  technology  innovation  in  the  automobile  industry  and  will  serve  as  enabling  infrastructures  for  developing  vehicular  data  clouds  .  one  of  the  most  important  applications  of  iot  technology  is  the  development  of  smart  homes,  smart  offices,  smart  cars,
__label__productinspection etc.,  in  a  smart  environment  domain  ,  ,  ,  ,  .  smart  home  environments  are  becoming  a  part  of  our  everyday  life  where  different  devices  and  technologies  are  deployed.  in  particular,  the  smart  home  application,  which  has  recently  gained  more  popularity,  includes  a  set  of  connected  sensors,  appliances,  and  gadgets  that  can  be  used  to  control  and  monitor  various  household  characteristics  such  as  heating,  lighting,  and  security  ,  .  there  are  two  immediate  driving  forces  bringing  iot  connectivity  to  vehicles.  one  is  for  the  connected  vehicle  to  communicate,  via  the  mobile  network,  with  the  connected  house,  and  the  other  is
__label__productinspection to  adjust  any  connected  devices  in  the  home  remotely.  the  mobile  network  plays  a  significant  role  in  reliably  and  securely  transferring  relevant  data  from  the  vehicle  to  the  house.  the  iot  technology  enables  linking  physical  objects,  such  as  different  devices  and  sensors,  with  virtual  objects,  which  exist  through  internet  connections,  with  increased  comfort  and  safety.  a  seamless  communication  from  the  home  to  vehicle  and  to  other  parts  of  life  is  now  expected.  this  is  leading  to  smartphone  connectivity  with  the  vehicle  and  the  connectivity  of  the  vehicle  with  the  cloud,  etc.  however,  limitations  exist  regarding  the  evolution  of  cellular  connectivity
__label__productinspection once  the  necessary  components  are  embedded  in  the  vehicle  .  nowadays,  there  is  a  growing  demand  for  continuous  access  to  the  internet  in  vehicles  to  provide  improved  safety,  comfort,  mobility,  and  entertainment.  as  more  people  spend  a  considerable  part  of  their  lives  in  their  vehicles,  drivers  will  increasingly  demand  access  to  applications  such  as  google  maps  and  youtube  using  the  familiar  interfaces  in  their  car  .  additionally,  as  mobile  devices  continue  to  grow  in  usage,  people  are  creating  secondary  interface  experiences  related  to,  but  not  necessarily  attached  to,  their  vehicles,  making  this  type  of  device  a  prime  choice  for  any
__label__productinspection vehicular  application.  moreover,  they  expect  to  have  the  same  connectivity  in  their  vehicles  as  they  have  at  home  and  at  work.  therefore,  future  automotive  it  infrastructure  and  interaction  specifications  should  follow  on  from  general  humancomputer  interaction  guidelines  with  the  understanding  that  there  will  be  a  high  heterogeneity  required  to  manage  these  contexts  .  even  when  end  users  can  communicate  with  the  iot  via  multiple  modalities,  one  of  the  most  common  ways  to  interact  with  electronic  devices  is  through  a  graphical  user  interface  gui.  however,  graphical  interfaces  can  be  confusing  and  difficult  to  use  when  users  employ  different  interfaces  in  several
__label__productinspection environments.  as  the  main  modality  that  humans  use  to  communicate  with  each  other,  speech  can  be  one  of  the  most  convenient  means  of  interaction.  in  terms  of  vehicle  safety  ,  the  user  interface  is  designed  with  connectivity  in  mind,  significantly  enhancing  the  possibilities  of  such  technologies  as  speech  synthesis  and  speech  recognition  ,  .  a  recent  advance  in  speech  recognition  is  the  adaptation  of  natural  language  understanding  technology,  thereby  improving  the  efficiency  of  humancomputer  interactions  .  speech  interfaces  are  attracting  more  attention,  and  therefore,  speech  recognition  technology  is  becoming  an  integral  part  of  interacting  with  iot  devices.  in  the  near
__label__productinspection future,  speech  interface  technology  will  enable  the  end  users  to  naturally  speak  to  their  household  devices  instead  of  pushing  the  buttons  or  clicking  the  icons  on  a  gui.  vehicles  have  become  a  sophisticated  and  pivotal  piece  of  the  iot  and  have  always  been  an  extension  of  us,  integrated  into  our  lifestyles  and  daily  tasks  as  a  reflection  of  our  human  experience.  thanks  to  internet  technologies,  the  vehicle  is  able  to  interact  with  other  connected  ecosystems  such  as  the  smart  home,  providing  seamless  mobility  .  drivers  increasingly  want  to  stay  connected  to  their  homes  while  driving  and  enable  seamless  home  automation

__label__productinspection the  google  voice  recognition  engine  and  cloudbased  nlu  engine  are  used.  depending  upon  the  voice  commands  given,  the  infotainment  system  performs  the  actions  accordingly.  the  cloudbased  smart  home  platform,  which  connects  the  vehicle  to  the  home  or  vice  versa  by  smartphonebased  connectivity,  is  suggested  as  shown  in  .  all  home  iot  devices  that  could  be  integrated  together  in  a  unified  platform  for  the  maximum  benefit  and  control  include  a  robotic  cleaner,  an  air  conditioner,  refrigerator,  multiroom  speaker,  lighting,  temperature  control,  and  automatic  parking  control  system.  a  cloudbased  smart  home  platform  is  used  for  all  digital  appliances  to  be  remotely  monitored
__label__productinspection and  controlled  for  both  the  vehicle  and  home  environments,  utilizing  a  homogeneous  speech  interface.  along  with  an  increasing  number  of  digital  appliances  in  the  smart  home  space,  complex  control  or  management,  including  numerous  data  storage  systems,  is  becoming  a  heavy  burden  on  the  smart  home  system  .  home  devices  connected  to  smart  home  server.  cloud  computing  represents  an  ondemand  service  model  for  delivering  resources  ranging  from  storage  and  data  access  via  computation  to  software  provisioning,  so  it  becomes  an  ideal  alternative.  thus,  we  consider  that  the  smart  home  can  merge  into  the  cloud  to  provide  more  services  and  obtain  more
__label__productinspection information  provided  by  the  cloud.  zigbee  and  wifi  wireless  home  automation  technology  are  being  adopted  to  modify  existing  housing.  the  coexistence  of  wireless  technologies  in  iot  wifi,  zigbee,  bluetooth,  and  bluetooth  low  energy  is  considered  for  an  indoor  environment  ,  ,  ,  .  as  the  number  of  devices  increases,  the  possibility  of  interference  in  a  home  environment  also  increases.  interference  in  a  home  environment  is  a  result  of  devices  using  different  technologies  for  communication.  therefore,  different  types  of  gateways  are  used  to  connect  different  technologies  within  the  home  to  provide  access  from  the  home  to  external  services  and  vice  versa.
__label__productinspection as  the  groupedcontrolled  iot  devices  for  this  study,  12  roll  shades  and  eight  smart  bulbs  are  used.  the  roll  shade  device  uses  the  zwave  communication  protocol  and  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  a  zwave  gateway  device  with  an  ethernet  interface.  the  smart  bulb  device  has  the  zigbee  communication  protocol  and  can  be  connected  to  the  internet  by  the  zigbee  gateway  device  with  a  wifi  interface.  we  have  applied  smart  bulb  devices  as  the  lighting  sources  for  a  living  room,  a  dining  room,  and  a  kitchen.  the  smart  thinq  sensor  is  used  to  detect  the  status  of  the  washer
__label__productinspection and  dryer  using  another  zigbee  communication  device  .  the  device  detects  the  vibration  of  the  washer  and  dryer  and  can  distinguish  the  end  of  the  operation.  in  addition,  a  refrigerator,  an  air  conditioner,  a  robot  cleaner,  and  two  multiroom  speakers  are  used  as  wifi  communication  devices  .  a  motorized  garage  door  opener  and  an  ultrasonic  sensor,  which  can  detect  the  parking  distance  when  a  car  enters  the  parking  lot  and  drives  to  a  reserved  parking  space,  are  used  for  automated  parking  control.  for  the  parking  distance  detection  sensor,  two  ultrasonic  sensors  are  used.  if  a  vehicle  is  correctly  parked  in
__label__productinspection the  parking  lot,  the  light  shows  a  green  color;  otherwise,  the  light  shows  a  red  color.  moreover,  the  status  of  the  sensor  is  transferred  to  a  cloud  platform  and  used  to  automatically  open  the  back  door  located  in  the  parking  lot.  the  proposed  concept  is  substantiated  through  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios,  which  are  described  in  ,  ,  and  :  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  it  is  suggested,  as  a  means  for  the  driver,  for  users  to  make  use  of  the  iot  in  their  daily  living.  we  use  both  the  lifestyle  research
__label__productinspection method  and  the  real  vehicle  testing  method  to  prove  the  concept  and  to  ensure  that  our  study  is  as  realistic  as  possible.  we  assume  that  the  driver  is  a  commuter  and  periodically  visits  several  locations  since  it  is  quite  easy  to  find  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns,  both  before  starting  to  drive  and  after  driving.  the  possible  service  scenarios  of  a  driver  making  use  of  the  iot  in  their  daily  living  are  suggested  as  primary  and  are  designed  to  reduce  the  inconvenience  of  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency.  it  uses  the  vehicular  data  cloud  in  an  iot
__label__productinspection environment  that  has  the  capability  to  integrate  numerous  devices  available  within  the  home  and  devices  in  the  vehicle.  therefore,  we  focus  on  how  cloud  services  could  be  effectively  utilized  for  the  real  lifestyle  when  an  end  user  rides  in  a  vehicle  with  devices  connected  through  the  iot.  scenario  for  an  individual  on  the  way  home.  scenario  for  arriving  at  home.  scenario  for  living  at  home.  scenario  for  leaving  home.  the  first  scenario  is  the  way  to  home.  in  this  scenario,  the  smartphone  is  placed  on  the  wireless  charger  and  the  welcome  message  is  automatically  shown  whenever  the  driver  gets  into
__label__productinspection the  vehicle.  when  a  driver  is  near  his  or  her  vehicle,  the  door  unlocks  and  is  automatically  opened.  moreover,  the  status  information  will  be  sent  to  the  iot  cloud.  it  is  important  to  note  that  these  sensors  can  be  freely  placed  all  around  the  doors  and  doorjambs  since  they  are  relatively  inexpensive.  we  believe  that  they  will  be  triggered  by  an  input  from  the  pressure  or  force  sensors  or  other  types  of  sensors  around  the  doors  and  doorjambs.  a  hypothetical  scenario  could  be  the  enabling  and  integration  of  wireless  sensor  networks  and  the  iot  environment.  the  cloudbased  smart  home  platform
__label__productinspection can  then  determine  the  time  to  transmit  every  control  command.  the  second  scenario  is  for  arriving  at  home.  as  a  driver  arrives  home,  the  vehicle  receives  the  gps  information  and  the  voice  message  is  given  to  the  driver  to  trigger  the  garage  door  opener  remotely.  when  the  driver  gives  the  voicebased  command,  while  in  the  vehicle,  the  garage  door  is  opened  remotely  and  automatically.  when  the  vehicle  is  detected  after  entering  into  the  garage,  the  garage  door  is  closed  automatically  by  the  command  from  the  smart  home  server.  this  action  is  triggered  by  the  parking  distance  detection  sensor.  the  use
__label__productinspection of  parking  distance  sensing  with  two  ultrasonic  sensors  is  designed  to  detect  when  the  vehicle  enters  the  parking  lot  and  heads  to  the  correct  reserved  parking  space.  when  the  vehicle  is  parked  in  the  given  space,  the  smart  home  server  automatically  transmits  a  command  to  open  the  backdoor  lock  located  inside  the  garage.  the  third  scenario  is  for  living  at  home.  this  scenario  assumes  that  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns  are  conducted  automatically  to  minimize  routine  tasks.  sequential  commands  from  the  cloudbased  smart  home  server  are  given  to  turn  on  the  lights,  play  music  from  multiroom  speakers,  and  open  the  grouped  12
__label__productinspection roll  shades.  the  scenario  assumes  that  the  roll  shades  are  initially  closed,  and  the  lights  are  dimmed  prior  to  detecting  any  illumination  changes.  all  types  of  iot  devices  are  controlled  when  voice  commands  are  received  from  the  habitant.  room  illumination  controllers  were  deployed  in  an  actual  house  using  smart  bulbs.  in  addition,  seamless  music  playing  was  conducted  by  multiroom  speakers.  the  refrigerator  and  air  conditioner  could  also  be  controlled  using  the  temperature  information  provided  by  the  nest  built  in  the  house.  the  last  scenario  is  for  leaving  home.  this  scenario  assumes  that  repetitive  lifestyle  patterns  are  conducted  when  the  driver
__label__productinspection or  habitant  leaves  the  home  for  the  same  purpose  of  minimizing  routine  tasks.  the  light  bulbs  and  multiroom  speakers  are  turned  off  and  roll  shades  are  automatically  closed  by  the  opening  of  the  front  door  lock.  this  operation  is  done  after  the  status  of  all  iot  devices  is  checked.  when  the  front  door  lock  is  closed,  the  status  of  the  iot  devices  is  automatically  transferred  to  the  smartphone,  allowing  the  driver  to  verify  the  proper  operation.  in  our  research,  real  vehicle  testing  is  conducted  for  the  way  to  home  and  arriving  at  home  scenarios  and  virtual  home  life  experience  testing
__label__productinspection is  accompanied  for  the  living  at  home  and  leaving  home  scenarios.  for  vehicle  testing,  a  5  km  driving  route  on  an  urban  road,  which  starts  from  the  office  and  ends  at  home,  is  used  to  validate  the  way  to  home  scenario  and  arriving  at  home  scenario.  the  route  guidance  is  given  from  the  google  navigation  and  the  participants  issue  voice  commands  and  check  the  status  according  to  each  command  while  driving.  for  safety,  participants  are  instructed  to  drive  under  a  speed  of  60  km/h.  a  lot  of  efforts  are  needed  to  enhance  the  performance  of  voice  activation  and  voice  recognition.
__label__productinspection specially,  a  huge  acoustic  database  collection  is  necessary  and  an  elaborate  training  procedure  is  required  to  support  the  specific  keyword  recognition  by  anyone.  for  home  testing,  it  is  confirmed  that  each  iot  device  works  correctly  and  properly  according  to  the  voice  command  in  standalone.  as  the  next  step,  interoperability  testing  is  performed  through  various  other  wireless  routers.  the  unreliability  issue  of  voice  recognition  exists  according  to  the  distance  between  the  user  and  natural  language  interface  input  device.  it  is  discovered  that  the  recognition  accuracy  needs  to  be  improved.  in  addition,  system  operational  tasks  such  as  new  device  registration,  device  initialization,
__label__productinspection and  failure  monitoring,  etc.,  need  to  be  tightened  up  to  stabilize  the  smart  home  server.  summarizes  the  evaluation  result  for  the  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  mentioned  in  .  according  to  the  study,  since  almost  all  of  the  tasks  of  the  first  scenario  to  do  things  like  lock/unlock  the  door,  turn  on  the  a/c,  and  receive  todays  schedule  are  very  routine,  not  so  essential,  and  preferable,  it  is  hard  to  expect  the  greatest  effectiveness  when  it  is  served  automatically  or  controlled  remotely.  above  all,  it  is  insufficient  to  give  simple  information  such  as  the  current  temperature  or  todays  schedule  for  users
__label__productinspection to  feel  comfortable  and  useful.  more  customized  offerings  need  to  be  provided  to  meet  their  expectation  based  on  the  users  preferred  recommendations.  evaluation  summary.  the  experimental  result  of  the  second  scenario  indicates  that  a  special  benefit  can  be  derived  since  it  makes  repetitive  routine  tasks  one  task,  executed  by  a  command.  when  the  driver  approaches  home,  a  voice  command  for  opening  the  garage  door  is  given  and  it  is  used  as  a  triggering  event  for  the  other  sequential  tasks.  it  is  generated  by  detecting  the  location  of  the  house  and  the  remaining  tasks  of  the  scenario  are  executed  automatically  in
__label__productinspection the  perfect  order.  the  driver  is  not  forced  to  get  out  of  the  car  and  he  can  open  and  close  the  garage  door  and  open  the  back  door  of  their  house  without  any  action.  it  can  substitute  routine  and  repetitive  works  for  a  human  being.  of  course,  it  needs  to  be  provided  at  an  appropriate  time  and  with  no  fault.  however,  there  is  the  possibility  that  the  current  voice  command  can  be  replaced  with  another  method  and  user  convenience  can  be  maximized  when  iot  devices  are  fully  connected  in  the  near  future.  in  relation  to  the  third  scenario,  we  realize
__label__productinspection it  is  useful  to  utilize  the  control  command  by  analyzing  the  data  base  acquired  from  the  cloudbased  home  server.  since  it  collects  and  distributes  the  information  from  and  to  the  home  and  vehicles,  it  predicts  personalized  preferences  and  creates  useful  applications  in  various  ways.  in  this  research,  a  limited  number  of  devices  are  integrated  and  the  scenario  is  proposed  to  only  apply  essential  tasks  executed  automatically  without  any  request,  even  if  not  repetitive.  however,  some  scenarios  have  the  capability  to  integrate  numerous  devices,  as  much  as  possible.  for  this  purpose,  it  is  important  that  the  smart  home  platform  is  designed
__label__productinspection to  allow  for  expansion  in  the  scope  and  service  to  offer  special  and  efficient  home  services  for  different  types  of  digital  appliances.  control  commands  should  be  applied  without  any  error,  at  the  right  time,  and  with  authorized  permission.  otherwise,  users  feel  significant  inconvenience  and  will  no  longer  use  these  services.  in  addition,  since  the  status  of  each  device  can  be  changed  at  any  time  by  anyone,  this  can  cause  a  serious  security  situation  or  issue.  for  example,  a  garage  door  can  be  opened  or  the  music  can  be  played  from  the  multiroom  speaker  in  the  middle  of  the  night.  regarding
__label__productinspection the  natural  language  interface  for  home  scenarios,  we  also  find  it  is  very  important  to  maximize  the  accuracy  and  precision,  since  a  voice  signals  conversion  into  text  form  depends  on  the  recognition  distance.  the  fourth  scenario  test  results  show  that  it  is  important  to  sense  the  intention  of  habitants  departure  correctly  as  part  of  the  process  of  gaining  trust  for  their  delegating  work.  it  is  assumed  that  there  are  no  remaining  users  in  the  house  and  the  user  goes  out  for  the  purpose  of  being  away  for  a  long  time.  the  status  of  grouped  iot  devices  is  changed  by  the
__label__productinspection status  transition  of  the  front  door  lock.  it  is  necessary  to  verify  when  control  commands  are  executed  and  the  changed  status  is  transferred  to  habitants.  the  ability  to  receive  the  status  of  iot  devices  remotely  makes  the  user  feel  secure,  even  if  they  do  not  check  the  status  of  the  home  in  advance  before  leaving.  this  is  adapted  in  reality  when  the  user  does  not  have  enough  time  to  check  the  status  or  forgets  to  check  it.  in  this  paper,  we  propose  the  concept  of  a  home  iot  connected  vehicle  with  a  voicebased  virtual  personal  assistant.  the  virtual  personal  assistant
__label__productinspection stays  with  a  driver  to  consistently  assist  while  driving,  at  home,  at  the  office,  or  while  running  errands.  the  system  provides  a  communication  channel  between  the  user  and  the  virtual  personal  assistant  using  a  homogeneous  voicebased  natural  language  interface,  both  in  the  vehicle  and  at  home.  the  proposed  concept  was  evaluated  by  implementing  a  linked  smartphone  and  home  iot  devices  that  were  connected  to  a  vehicles  infotainment  system.  in  addition,  a  smartphonebased  natural  language  interface  input  device  and  cloudbased  home  iot  devices  for  the  home  were  utilized.  several  hometovehicle  connected  service  scenarios  were  substantiated  with  the  aim  of  reducing  the
__label__productinspection inconvenience  of  simple  and  repetitive  tasks  by  improving  the  urban  mobility  efficiency  in  an  iot  environment  by  performing  real  vehicle  testing  and  lifestyle  research.  the  scenarios  included  the  following:  the  way  to  home,  arriving  at  home,  living  at  home,  and  leaving  home.  this  study  shows  that  it  is  insufficient  to  provide  only  simple  information  such  as  the  current  temperature  or  todays  schedule.  a  remarkable  benefit  is  derived  by  combining  sequentially  repetitive  routine  tasks  into  one  task  or  by  executing  essential  tasks  automatically,  without  any  request.  however,  the  automatic  execution  of  tasks  should  be  used  with  authorized  permission,  applied  without  any
__label__productinspection error  only  at  certain  fixed  times,  and  applied  under  limited  conditions  to  sense  habitants  status  correctly.  this  will  allow  the  habitants  to  gain  trust  regarding  the  remote  execution  of  tasks.  future  work  may  include  more  comprehensive  study  in  relation  to  driving  safety  and  vehicle  security.  the  connected  car  will  be  more  entertaining,  more  efficient  than  traditional  cars,  and  an  advanced  it  technology  such  as  iot  will  provide  new  functionalities,  including  the  hometovehicle  connected  services  proposed  in  this  research.  however,  it  will  inevitably  increase  the  drivers  invehicle  interactions  and  decrease  their  attention  whilst  driving,  potentially  causing  additional  driver  distraction  while  driving.
__label__productinspection in  order  to  mitigate  driver  distraction  while  using  mobile  devices,  a  safer  interaction  design  should  be  considered  under  the  circumstance  of  driving  since  it  is  important  to  consider  safety  first  over  convenience  ,  .  the  connected  car  is  an  interim  step  on  the  way  to  the  truly  autonomous  vehicle,  which  will  free  up  drivers  to  conduct  other  activities  while  en  route  to  work  and  during  trips.  in  this  step,  finding  an  efficient  way  to  optimize  drivers  current  invehicle  use  is  meaningful  and  practical  in  terms  of  road  safety  and  we  believe  that  a  speech  interface  will  certainly  become  an  increasingly
__label__productinspection vital  part  of  how  we  interact  with  our  cars  .  securing  the  connected  car  from  cyberattacks  is  no  easy  task.  additionally,  the  wealth  of  data  available  about  the  cars  and  its  occupantstheir  whereabouts,  driving  habits,  behavior,  preferences,  and  interestswill  need  to  be  carefully  managed,  to  keep  it  private  and  to  decide  who  gets  to  use  it  and  how  .  eventually,  a  cloud  will  benefit  from  iot  by  increasing  its  scope  to  deal  with  existent  world  things,  providing  a  significant  number  of  new  services  for  reallife  applications  such  as  smart  city  ,  smart  surveillance  ,  etc.  however,  a  very  reliable  security
__label__productinspection infrastructure,  including  methods  for  users  to  authenticate,  use  a  twoway  mapping  process  between  users  and  devices,  access  policy  creation  and  enforcement,  logging  and  alerting  capability,  and  secure  communication  should  be  considered  above  all  things.  the  security  challenges  for  the  integration  of  iot  and  cloud  computing,  and  the  secure  integration  of  mobile  devices  into  the  vehicle  must  be  considered  for  the  direction  of  future  research  ,  ,  .  this  work  was  supported  by  the  vehicle  component  technology  center  of  lg  electronics  and  silicon  valley  lab.  of  honda  rd  americas,  inc.  we  would  like  to  thank  sangyong  lee  and  shinichi  akama  for

__label__productinspection will  need  to  change  their  perspective  if  they  wish  to  capitalize  on  the  promise  of  connected  vehicles.  fromusagebased  insurance  to  dynamic  ride  sharing  services,  preventive  maintenance  alerts  and  shared  auto  loans,  connected  vehicles  and  mobility  services  have  forever  changed  the  course  for  oems.  ever  forget  to  fill  your  gas  tank?  change  your  oil?  replace  your  battery?  most  gps  devices  can  alert  drivers  to  traffic  snags  or  the  presence  of  law  enforcement.  but  connected  vehicles  can  also  help  automatically  manage  requirements  for  parts  and  services  by  collecting  data  about  speed,  temperature,  fault  codes  and  more  then  sending  alerts  and  reminders  to
__label__productinspection keep  the  car  safe  to  drive.  imagine  getting  an  alert  on  your  dashboard  to  change  your  transmission  fluid  or  get  your  radiator  flushed.  consumers  will  no  longer  see  a  generic  check  engine  light.  no  more  guessing  at  what  the  problem  might  be.  how  does  that  help  oems?  when  systems  fail,  consumers  largely  hold  the  manufacturer  responsible  even  if  the  failure  was  from  natural  wear  and  tear  or  user  error.  fewer  failures  mean  happier  customers.  and  that  means  more  loyalty  for  the  brand.  but  thats  not  all.  using  data  from  connected  vehicles,  manufacturers  can  get  a  sense  of  parts  that  arent

__label__productinspection connected  cars  are  extremely  complex,  so  testing  and  qa  of  their  software  cannot  be  overlooked.  its  essential  to  test  the  performance  of  their  systems  in  a  variety  of  environments  and  situations.  the  automotive  industry  has  come  a  long  way  from  early  fossil  fueldriven  vehicles  to  those  including  hybrid  and  fully  electric  systems,  but  aside  from  powertype  advancements,  car  manufacturers  have  been  making  leaps  in  other  areas.  todays  developments  have  seen  the  advent  of  connected  and  selfdriven  cars,  allowing  for  an  unheardof  level  of  autonomy.  while  are  only  an  emerging  technology,  connected  cars  have  already  been  on  the  market  for  a
__label__productinspection while.  connected  vehicles  are  fitted  with  devices  that  enable  them  to  connect  with  the  external  environment.  this  includes  sharing  and  obtaining  information  via  mobile  broadband  3g5g,  wifi  or  satellite  communication  technology  within  internet  of  things  iot  networks.  however,  due  to  their  developing  complexity,  connected  vehicles  require  indepth  quality  assurance  at  the  software  level  to  verify  that  they  keep  up  with  their  suggested  functionality  levels.  testing  specialists  use  various  methods  to  ensure  the  quality  and  safety  of  iotpowered  vehicles.  well  overview  the  software  testing  techniques  implemented  in  the  vehicle  manufacturing  industry,  but  first,  we  need  to  look  at  how  data  actually
__label__productinspection travels  within  and  between  connected  cars.  before  diving  straight  into  testing  methodologies,  its  vital  to  understand  how  data  is  shared  and  utilized  in  connected  vehicles.  data  collection,  sharing  and  use  is  the  backbone  of  how  connected  car  technology  operates.  it  can  be  divided  into  five  levels:  these  systems  are  complex  and  require  accuracy,  which  is  why  various  testing  methods  are  applied  to  ensure  car  safety,  the  integrity  of  human  life  and  the  systems  reliability.  for  this,  vehicles  can  be  tested  in  various  environments:  with  connected  vehicle  technologies  rapidly  advancing  year  by  year,  applying  the  correct  testing  solutions  is  critical.  these
__label__productinspection solutions  generally  relate  to  two  types  of  systems:  internal  environment  sensors  can  monitor  speed,  parking  positions,  indicators,  high  beam  lights  and  other  information.  external  environment  sensors  include  lane  departure,  forward  collision,  pedestrian  collision,  and  other  warnings.  adas  and  telematics  systems  should  be  of  a  high  standard  and  quality  as  theyre  responsible  for  vehicle  performance  and,  as  a  result,  for  human  life.  a  lack  of  testing  can  lead  to  failures  in  internal  car  parts,  which  can  ultimately  result  in  vehicle  or  wireless  connector  breakages.  this  can  cause  disorientation  for  the  car  due  to  the  absence  of  communication  with  the  outside  world.
__label__productinspection these  systems  require  bug  detection  at  an  early  stage  of  software  development,  as  well  as  continuous  testing  to  ensure  quality  throughout  the  vehicle  lifecycle.  to  prevent  damaging  consequences,  qa  engineers  use  various  types  of  testing,  such  as:  frequently,  these  types  of  testing  need  to  be  automated  to  run  continuously,  especially  with  the  great  amounts  of  data  nodes  found  in  iot  networks.  many  companies  refer  to  to  accelerate  testing  speed,  decrease  the  number  of  code  bugs  and  optimize  the  time  it  takes  to  get  software  products  to  market.  software  testing  is  one  of  the  disciplines  not  to  be  overlooked  when  stuffing

__label__productinspection in  the  future,  urban  transportation  is  expected  to  be  electric,  autonomous,  and  ondemand.  this  is  the  vision  that  captures  the  major  trends  in  mobility  and  is  one  that  companies  like  uber  and  google  already  appear  to  be  working  toward.  navigant  research  believes  that  ondemand  shared  transportation  serviceswhether  carsharing,  ridehailing,  bikesharing,  or  even  public  transitwill  converge  with  the  major  vehicle  technology  trends  of  electrification,  wireless  connectivity,  and  autonomous  driving  capability  to  create  a  lowcarbon  transportation  system  for  cities  over  the  next  25  years.  navigant  research  has  covered  these  trends  in  its  recentlypublished  transportation  outlook:  2025  to  2050  white  paper  and  will
__label__productinspection discuss  them  further  in  a  june  14  webinar,  changing  models  for  urban  mobility  .  this  convergence  is  happening  already.  the  first  piece,  wireless  connectivity,  is  a  key  building  block  technology  for  a  future  where  personal  transportation  transitions  to  mobility  as  a  service.  by  2025,  navigant  research  forecasts  that  more  than  1.2  billion  vehicles  globally  are  expected  to  be  connected  to  their  surroundings  and/or  to  each  other  through  either  builtin  or  broughtin  communications  technology.  at  a  baseline,  these  systems  will  provide  realtime  safety  alerts  and  traffic  notifications  to  drivers;  the  more  mature  and  fullfeatured  systems  will  support  semiautonomous  driving  systems.  in
__label__productinspection this  same  timeframe,  the  number  of  vehicles  equipped  with  some  form  of  telematics  will  also  grow  rapidly.  by  2025,  most  new  vehicles  in  developed  markets  are  likely  to  have  telematics  offering  various  types  of  services  to  the  driver.  today,  this  type  of  connectivity  is  already  central  to  electric  vehicles  evs,  which  have  navigation  systems  that  alert  the  driver  to  available  charging  stations  and  provide  battery  charge  status  updates.  photo  courtesy  of  carsharing.org  the  convergence  is  also  already  occurring  between  vehicle  electrification  and  shared  mobility.  evs  are  an  increasingly  popular  option  in  carsharing  schemes  in  cities.  indeed,  city  officials  looking  to
__label__productinspection control  pollution  in  congested  city  centers  are  actively  encouraging  the  use  of  evs  in  carshare  services.  for  example,  officials  in  london  pushed  hard  to  bring  to  the  city  an  electric  carsharing  scheme  similar  to  the  successful  autolib  service  in  paris;  the  new  service  opened  in  spring  2016.  carsharing  services  already  see  a  greater  percentage  of  evs  in  their  fleets  than  is  found  in  the  wider  passenger  car  population.  navigant  research  estimated  that  plugin  hybrids  and  battery  evs  represented  more  than  15  of  all  vehicles  in  carshare  services  as  of  2015.  while  these  evs  are  largely  concentrated  in  a  handful  of
__label__productinspection servicessuch  as  the  allelectric  autolib,  allelectric  carshare  companies  in  china,  and  in  some  of  daimlers  and  bmws  carshare  servicesevs  are  expected  to  expand  to  many  more  carshare  operations  through  2025  and  beyond.  one  reason  for  this  is  that  carsharing  will  be  a  growing  option  for  automakers  to  put  certain  types  of  cars  into  serviceprimarily  fuel  efficient,  electricpowered,  and  autonomousand  many  oems  are  expected  to  operate  these  transportation  services  themselves  as  a  way  to  offset  reductions  in  revenue  due  to  falling  vehicle  sales  in  urban  areas.  carsharing  is  a  key  building  block  for  the  future  of  mobility  as  a  service,  and
__label__productinspection is  now  a  wellestablished  industry  that  feels  familiar  rather  than  new.  but  in  fact,  this  business  is  at  the  early  stages  of  major  upheaval  that  will  change  the  role  it  plays  in  urban  mobility.  first  off,  automakers  are  entering  the  market  in  earnest,  and  it  is  expected  that  almost  all  major  automakers  will  be  offering  some  type  of  shared  vehicle  service  by  2025.  a  second  disruptor  is  the  rise  of  the  oneway  operational  model.  with  drivers  no  longer  required  to  return  vehicles  to  the  same  parking  spot  where  they  picked  it  up,  carsharing  significantly  expands  its  use  case  for  city
__label__productinspection residents.  carsharing  now  can  provide  true  ondemand  mobility  and  be  used  for  spurofthemoment  travel  needs  and  for  shorter  oneway  trips  than  is  typical  for  conventional  roundtrip  carsharing.  this  new  operational  model  makes  carsharing  more  like  the  third  major  disruptor  in  the  shared  vehicle  sector:  the  explosive  popularity  of  ridehailing  apps  like  uber  and  lyft.  while  these  two  services  can  be  seen  as  competing,  they  are  better  thought  of  as  complementary,  each  offering  a  different  type  of  experience  for  the  customer.  carsharing  acts  as  a  replacement  for  owning  a  car,  whereas  ridehailing  is  more  directly  a  replacement  for  conventional  taxi  services.
__label__productinspection oneway  carsharing  and  ridehailing  services  may  well  compete  for  customers,  but  navigant  research  believes  that  the  urban  mobility  model  of  the  future  will  have  both  carsharing  and  ridehailing.  both  services  probably  will  be  early  markets  for  autonomous  driving  technology,  the  final  piece  of  this  lowcarbon  mobility  as  a  service  model.  it  is  likely  that  autonomous  vehicles  will  initially  be  integrated  into  shared  fleets  in  a  controlled  and  regulated  setting.  sites  like  central  london,  paris,  and  singapore  are  anticipated  to  be  among  the  first.  from  2025  on,  a  number  of  entitiesincluding  carsharing  companies,  taxi  fleets,  ridehailing  companies,  and  automakersare  expected  to
__label__productinspection be  operating  autonomous  fleets.  in  particular,  automakers  likely  will  embrace  the  autonomous  fleet  idea  as  an  extension  of  their  current  involvement  in  carsharing  schemes  and  will  seek  to  incorporate  them  into  their  ev  models.  gm  has  announced  it  will  begin  offering  autonomous  chevrolet  volts  for  its  employees  to  drive  at  its  technical  center  in  warren,  michigan  in  late  2016.  according  to  the  united  nations,  by  2050,  as  much  as  66  of  the  worlds  population  is  expected  to  live  in  urban  areas,  and  the  individually  owned  vehicle  will  probably  become  a  rarity  in  most  large  cities.  the  possibility  that  shared  mobility
__label__productinspection may  lead  to  less  use  of  public  transit  has  been  an  oftcited  concern  among  city  officials  and  sustainable  transportation  advocates.  a  2016  report  by  the  found  that  services  like  carsharing  and  ridehailing  are  actually  complementary  to  public  transit.  the  report,  which  focused  on  users  in  seven  u.s.  cities,  noted  that  the  people  that  use  shared  modes  of  transportation  the  most  were  the  most  likely  to  use  public  transit  and  to  own  fewer  cars.  navigant  research  also  believes  that,  from  2025  onward,  public  transportation  itself  will  become  more  of  an  ondemand  service,  which  will  use  buses  much  more  efficiently.  connectivity  and
__label__productinspection data  analysis  will  enable  the  efficient  dispatch  of  vehicles  to  where  passengers  need  them,  keeping  idle  time  to  a  minimum.  these  services  can  be  fully  integrated  with  the  other  types  of  ondemand  options  in  the  city,  making  multimodal  travel  more  robust  and  seamless.

__label__productinspection horned  sungem  sdk.  when  an  object  is  detected  by  the  camera,  it  simply  publishes  a  message  to  the  mqtt  topic  called  camera/infer.  the  below  code  snippet  shows  how  we  treat  the  camera  like  a  typical  sensor  that  publishes  telemetry  to  an  aws  iot  mqtt  topic.  the  complete  source  code  for  the  camera  inference  is  available  on  github  in  the  cam.py  file.  philips  hue  uses  a  bridge  for  controlling  the  bulbs  based  on  the  zwave  protocol.  since  the  bridge  exposes  rest  api,  we  can  control  it  from  any  device  that  can  make  an  http  call.  one  of  the  raspberry  pi  devices
__label__productinspection runs  the  code  to  change  the  color  of  the  bulb  based  on  the  message  sent  to  a  topic  called  bulb/color.  this  device  doesnt  know  the  actual  publisher  sending  the  message.  its  job  is  to  subscribe  to  the  topic  and  change  the  color  based  on  the  published  message.  the  below  code  snippet  shows  the  callback  method  that  is  invoked  each  time  a  message  is  published  to  the  topic.  in  the  current  setup,  the  camera  is  publishing  to  the  topic  camera/infer  and  the  bulb  is  waiting  for  messages  on  bulb/color.  these  two  are  independent  topics  that  need  to  be  connected  through  business
__label__productinspection logic.  in  our  case,  we  want  to  turn  the  bulb  blue  when  the  detected  vehicle  type  is  a  bus  and  green  when  the  vehicle  is  a  car.  this  logic  is  written  as  a  lambda  function  and  deployed  to  aws  iot  greengrass.  the  function  is  published  as  a  normal  lambda  function  but  gets  pushed  to  the  edge  through  the  aws  console.  the  camera  publishes  to  the  aws  iot  topic,  camera/infer  that  is  received  by  the  lambda  function.  the  function  then  publishes  a  message  back  to  an  aws  iot  topic  called  bulb/color.  this  is  defined  as  a  set  of  subscriptions  in  aws
__label__productinspection iot  greengrass.  once  the  entire  configuration  is  done,  we  need  to  deploy  it  to  the  aws  iot  greengrass  core.  aws  iot  greengrass  is  a  simple  yet  powerful  platform  to  deploy  applications  at  the  edge.  this  scenario  highlights  how  to  perform  object  detection  based  on  a  smart  camera  managed  by  aws  iot  greengrass.
__label__productinspection industries  and  organizations  have  been  using  various  kinds  of  sensors  for  a  long  time  but  the  invention  of  the  internet  of  things  has  taken  the  evolutions  of  sensors  to  a  completely  different  level.  platforms  function  and  deliver  various  kind  of  intelligence  and  data  using  a  variety  of  sensors.  they  serve  to  collect  data,  pushing  it  and  sharing  it  with  a  whole  network  of  connected  devices.  all  this  collected  data  makes  it  possible  for  devices  to  autonomously  function,  and  the  whole  ecosystem  is  becoming  smarter  every  day.  by  combining  a  set  of  sensors  and  a  communication  network,  devices  share  information  with
__label__productinspection one  another  and  are  improving  their  effectiveness  and  functionality.  take  tesla  vehicles  as  an  example.  all  of  the  sensors  on  a  car  record  their  perception  of  the  surroundings,  uploading  the  information  into  a  massive  database.  the  data  is  then  processed  and  all  the  important  new  pieces  of  information  are  sent  to  all  other  vehicles.  this  is  an  ongoing  process,  through  which  a  whole  fleet  of  tesla  vehicles  is  becoming  smarter  every  day.  lets  take  a  look  at  some  of  the  key  sensors,  extensively  being  used  in  the  iot  world.  by  definition,  a  device,  used  to  measure  amount  of  heat  energy
__label__productinspection that  allows  to  detect  a  physical  change  in  temperature  from  a  particular  source  and  converts  the  data  for  a  device  or  user,  is  known  as  a  temperature  sensor.  these  sensors  have  been  deployed  for  a  long  time  in  a  variety  of  devices.  however,  with  the  emergence  of  iot,  they  have  found  more  room  to  be  present  in  an  even  greater  number  of  devices.  only  a  couple  of  years  ago,  their  uses  mostly  included  a/c  control,  refrigerators  and  similar  devices  used  for  environmental  control.  however,  with  the  advent  of  the  iot  world,  they  have  found  their  role  in  manufacturing  processes,  agriculture
__label__productinspection and  health  industry.  in  the  manufacturing  process,  many  machines  require  specific  environment  temperature,  as  well  as  device  temperature.  with  this  kind  of  measurement,  the  manufacturing  process  can  always  remain  optimal.  on  the  other  hand,  in  agriculture,  the  temperature  of  soil  is  crucial  for  crop  growth.  this  helps  with  the  production  of  plants,  maximizing  the  output.  followed  are  some  subcategories  of  temp  sensors:  thermocouples:  these  are  voltage  devices  that  indicate  temperature  measuring  with  a  change  in  voltage.  as  temperature  goes  up,  the  output  voltage  of  the  thermocouple  rises.  resistor  temperature  detectors  rtd:  the  resistance  of  the  device  is  directly  proportional  to

__label__productinspection solids  and  liquids  only,  not  possible  to  use  it  on  gases  because  of  their  transparent  nature.  a  device  that  detects  the  presence  or  absence  of  a  nearby  object,  or  properties  of  that  object,  and  converts  it  into  signal  which  can  be  easily  read  by  user  or  a  simple  electronic  instrument  without  getting  in  contact  with  them.  proximity  sensors  are  largely  used  in  the  retail  industry,  as  they  can  detect  motion  and  the  correlation  between  the  customer  and  product  they  might  be  interested  in.  a  user  is  immediately  notified  of  discounts  and  special  offers  of  nearby  products.  another  big  and  quite
__label__productinspection an  old  usecase  is  vehicles.  you  are  reversing  your  car  and  are  alrmed  about  an  obstacle  while  taking  reverse,  thats  the  work  of  proximity  sensor.  they  are  also  used  for  parking  availability  in  places  such  as  malls,  stadiums  or  airports.  following  are  some  of  the  proximity  sensors  subcategorised:  inductive  sensors:  inductive  proximity  sensors  are  used  for  noncontact  detection  to  find  out  the  presence  of  metallic  objects  using  electromagnetic  field  or  a  beam  of  electromagnetic  radiation.  it  can  operate  at  higher  speeds  than  mechanical  switches  and  also  seems  more  reliable  because  of  its  robustness.  capacitive  sensors  :  capacitive  proximity  sensors  can
__label__productinspection detect  both  metallic  as  well  as  nonmetallic  targets.  nearly  all  other  materials  are  dielectric  different  from  air.  it  can  be  used  to  sense  very  small  objects  through  a  large  portion  of  target.  so,  generally  used  in  difficult  and  complicated  applications.  photoelectric  sensors  :  photoelectric  sensor  is  made  up  of  lightsensitive  parts  and  uses  a  beam  of  light  to  detect  the  presence  or  absence  of  an  object.  it  is  an  ideal  alternative  of  inductive  sensors.  and  used  for  long  distance  sensing  or  to  sense  nonmetal  object.  ultrasonic  sensors:  ultrasonic  sensors  are  also  used  to  detect  the  presence  or  to  measure  the

__label__productinspection post  written  by  ami  gal  ,  a  serial  entrepreneur,  is  the  ceo  and  cofounder  of  sqream.  labeled  by  accenture  via  as  the  next  industrial  revolution,  the  internet  of  things  iot  has  extended  its  reach  to  everything  from  the  enterprise  to  the  household.  the  rising  availability  of  iot  sensors,  coupled  with  improved  network  connectivity,  has  created  a  tremendous  new  source  of  data  for  businesses  to  capitalize  on.  in  agriculture,  iot  data  helps  improve  production  yields  and  support  sustainable  production  for  the  environment.  in  manufacturing,  iot  enables  devices  to  work  more  efficiently  on  the  assembly  line.  from  smart  homes  to  smart  cities,
__label__productinspection and  from  industrial  sensors  to  autonomous  cars,  billions  of  sensors  stream  massive  data  volumes  to  the  cloud  each  day.  but  when  it  comes  to  iot,  cloud  computing  has  several  drawbacks.  advanced  5g  technology  hasnt  been  deployed  fast  enough  to  keep  up  with  the  explosion  of  iot  devices.  and  while  most  developed  cities  do  have  sufficient  network  access  to  support  iot,  the  same  cant  be  said  about  rural  locations,  which  are  home  to  many  industrial  installations.  in  the  event  of  a  network  outage,  iot  devices  located  in  such  areas  may  lose  some  or  all  of  their  functionality  and  that  is  assuming
__label__productinspection that  the  area  is  covered  at  all.  additionally,  the  processing  power  needed  to  extract  value  from  iot  data  has  led  to  extremely  high  it  costs  that  business  owners  are  struggling  to  keep  up  with  in  the  long  run.  the  proliferation  of  iot  and  subsequent  demand  for  highbandwidth  content  distribution  have  led  to  the  advent  of  edge  computing.  edge  computing  refers  to  processing  and  analytics  done  on  the  iot  device  itself,  or  by  a  local  computer  or  server,  rather  than  being  sent  to  centralized  or  cloud  servers.  because  the  data  is  stored  and  analyzed  in  close  proximity  to  the  data  source,
__label__productinspection an  edge  device  can  selfmanage  its  own  data  and  react  to  the  data  as  needed.  consider,  for  example,  a  heart  rate  monitor  instantly  alerting  a  caregiver  when  the  patient  needs  help.  or  how  in  a  vehicle,  the  cruise  control  must  run  inside  the  vehicle  in  order  to  be  reliably  responsive.  in  these  cases,  its  important  to  be  able  to  have  the  ability  to  perform  rapid  data  sampling  or  to  calculate  results  with  minimum  delay.  for  latencysensitive  applications,  edge  computing  is  not  just  beneficial  its  critical.  in  cases  where  there  is  not  enough  bandwidth  to  send  data  to  the  cloud,  or
__label__productinspection the  networks  connection  is  unreliable,  an  iot  device  on  a  decentralized  system  continues  to  work  autonomously.  its  functionality  will  be  significantly  less  affected  than  its  cloudreliant  counterpart.  retail  giant  amazon  uses  edge  computing  to  provide  its  customers  with  an  experience  in  its  amazon  go  stores  and  to  monitor  highvalue  shipments  out  of  its  warehouses.  processing  at  the  edge  also  eliminates  latency  and  improves  response  times  of  connected  applications  making  data  more  relevant,  useful  and  actionable.  edge  devices  are  always  on,  always  connected,  and  generating  more  data  compared  to  devices  that  interact  with  centralized  cloud  servers.  the  data  can  be  analyzed

__label__productinspection the  idea  that  ,  or  iot,  heralds  a  new  era  for  people  and  technology  is  far  beyond  theory.  the  transformations  are  already  emerging  all  around  us,  but  those  who  look  only  to  the  corporate  world  may  miss  some  of  the  most  inspiring  examples.  smart  cities  hold  some  of  the  planets  most  aweworthy  demonstrations  of  the  iots  potential.  what  should  wouldbe  insiders  stay  focused  on?  fear  not  of  missing  out,  because  davra  has  with  the  most  impact.  as  far  as  worldshaking  innovations  are  concerned,  modern  urban  spaces  are  hotbeds  of  new  ideas.  the  same  holds  true  in  connected  tech,  yet  a
__label__productinspection handful  of  applications  stand  out  as  continual  trendsetters.  keeping  the  streets  bright  is  more  than  just  a  good  means  of  attracting  wellheeled  professionals  and  taxpaying  small  businesses  to  a  growing  city.  smart  lighting  contributes  to  improved  quality  of  life  in  ways  that  are  easy  to  see  and  appreciate.  daylight  harvesting  connected  lighting  helps  daylightharvesting  systems  do  better  at  their  job  of  reducing  the  need  for  electrical  power.  by  automating  processes  like  setting  brightness  levels  and  tracking  daily  use,  these  implementations  improve  a  cities  ability  to  stay  green  economically.  load  management  although  lighting  is  an  inevitable  municipal  outlay,  its  not  the
__label__productinspection constant  fact  of  life  that  many  outside  observers  picture.  even  when  they  appear  to  shine  consistently,  street  lights  present  power  grid  operators  with  dynamic,  evolving  requirements.  are  ideal  for  managing  these  complex,  demanding  loads.  just  as  smart  buildings  measure  occupancy  to  decide  when  to  turn  on  room  lights,  facilities  like  municipal  vehicle  lots  can  count  cars  to  understand  their  peak  hours  and  make  the  best  use  of  site  power  during  outages.  ambiance  and  utility  improvements  smart  lighting  is  redefining  peoples  relationships  with  the  cities  they  inhabit.  municipalities  that  want  to  differentiate  themselves  from  their  neighbors  use  intelligent  lighting  to  provide
__label__productinspection situationally  appropriate  streetlevel  illumination.  this  is  a  great  way  to  cultivate  a  far  more  welcoming  appearance  while  simultaneously  minimizing  waste.  with  the  aid  of  uniform,  centralized  control  dashboards,  urban  managers  can  automatically  accomplish  tasks  once  regarded  impractical  at  best.  for  instance,  programmable  lights  might  help  guide  latenight  foot  traffic  after  a  big  concert  or  maintain  improved  visibility  around  trendy  bars  following  spikes  in  street  crime.  places  like  atlanta  have  experimented  with  using  led  lights  to  .  the  modular  nature  of  iotlinked  hardware  enables  new,  exciting  control  schemes  with  the  potential  to  help  urban  living  feel  safer  and  ultimately  more  appealing
__label__productinspection in  a  smart  city.  some  aspects  of  urban  management  arent  quite  as  glamorous  as  others,  but  the  internet  of  things  devices  make  these  tough  jobs  less  timeconsuming  and  errorprone.  ,  for  instance,  leaders  linked  data  from  sensorequipped  dumpsters  to  predictive  analytics  tools.  by  learning  to  anticipate  when  trash  receptacles  will  overflow  and  applying  the  knowledge  to  rethink  its  pest  control  tactics,  the  city  has  become  20  percent  more  effective  at  managing  rat  populations.  other  monitor  individual  events,  such  as  when  a  garbage  truck  lifts  a  rubbish  bin  or  visits  a  new  neighborhood.  smart  city  iot  platforms  use  such  data  to
__label__productinspection refine  collection  practices,  cut  back  on  vehicle  emissions  and  improve  service  quality.  as  a  fleetdriven  industry,  waste  management  exemplifies  how  even  minor  tech  changes  can  revolutionize  a  given  field  when  applied  at  scale.  for  example,  picture  a  small  town  administrator  whose  office  routinely  finds  itself  swamped  with  complaints  from  residents  and  business  owners  whose  bins  are  overflowing.  upgrading  to  receptacles  that  use  weight  sensors  to  signal  when  they  need  emptying  could  be  a  costconscious  way  to  appease  the  locals.  getting  around  in  the  big  city  can  be  quite  the  ordeal.  does  the  internet  of  things  hold  the  promise  of  change
__label__productinspection for  roadweary  commuters?  accident  awareness  and  safety  transit  benefits  immensely  when  those  at  the  helm  stay  informed  throughout  the  journey.  sadly,  traditional  disconnects  and  transportation  frameworks  havent  always  made  it  easy.  in  smart  cities,  however,  cars  that  get  into  wrecks  can  share  their  statuses  and  locations  with  authorities  instantly  via  public  networks.  in  addition  to  keeping  officials  in  the  know,  these  notifications  might  inform  other  smart  vehicles  that  they  should  slow  down.  some  smart  transit  tech  takes  accident  prevention  even  further.  embedded  sensors  that  monitor  sitespecific  conditions,  such  as  frozen  bridge  surfaces,  are  already  being  used  to  help  reroute  traffic
__label__productinspection and  dispatch  fleets  of  plows  and  salt  trucks.  since  lives  hang  in  the  balance  when  road  maintenance  lags,  such  improvements  are  easy  to  justify  even  in  the  face  of  tight  budgets.  what  will  the  smart  parking  structure  of  the  future  look  like?  while  most  outward  changes  will  likely  escape  all  but  the  closest  scrutiny,  the  nervous  systems  of  modern  lots  and  garages  are  taking  huge  strides  upward  and  onward.  some  lots  interact  with  smart  vehicles  to  gather  data  on  how  many  open  spaces  they  have  available.  others  use  vehicle  feedback  to  tell  precisely  where  the  openings  are  and  nudge  waiting
__label__productinspection cars  towards  the  path  of  least  resistance.  street  parking  hardware  can  perform  similar  feats  by  subtly  shepherding  motorists  away  from  overcrowding  and  even  mitigating  congestion  by  favoring  certain  parking  zones  at  specific  times.  in  many  locales,  the  environment  takes  a  back  seat  to  other  concerns.  whether  theyre  plagued  by  economic  constraints  or  a  fundamental  lack  of  foresight,  towns  and  cities  often  struggle  to  deal  with  problems  whose  origins  recede  generations  into  the  past.  the  iot  helps  paint  these  urgent  issues  in  a  clearer  focus.  for  example,  airquality  monitors  not  only  alert  people  to  dangerous  conditions  but  also  promote  public  accountability

__label__productinspection discovery.  see  below  if  your  system  does  not  have  multicast.  the  vision  sensor  application  is  acting  as  a  unique  sensor  which  publishes  information.  as  we  will  discuss  later  in  the  data  model  considerations  section,  each  vision  sensor  application  has  a  unique  id.  so,  if  you  run  more  than  one  vision  sensor  application,  you  should  run  it  from  a  different  directory  with  .properties  file.  the  vision.properties  file  has  an  entry  for  the  sensor  id.  look  for  the  following  in  the  properties  file:  if  your  network  doesnt  support  multicast,  you  can  run  this  example  using  only  unicast  data.  edit  the  userqosprofile.xml  file

__label__productinspection code  and  link  against  the  required  libraries.  to  build  the  applications  on  a  linux  system  run:  when  modeling  data  in  dds,  one  of  the  biggest  considerations  is,  what  represents  a  single  element  or  realworld  object  within  my  data  streams?  in  the  case  of  sensor  data,  you  can  generally  assume  that  each  sensor  should  be  represented  as  a  unique  object.  in  this  example,  we  are  modeling  our  data  types  separate  for  each  topic.  the  directory  has  an  automotive.idl  file  which  contains  definitions  forall  topics  used  in  this  example.  rti  connext  dds  uses  idl  the  interface  definition  by  the  omg  to  define
__label__productinspection languageindependent  .  more  information  about  idl  can  be  found  in  the  .  in  dds,  these  unique  realworld  objects  are  modeled  as  .  instances  are  described  by  a  set  of  unique  identifiers  called  ,  which  are  denoted  by  the  //key  symbol.  so,  in  our  example,  we  use  a  sensorid  as  a  key  field:  the  datatypes  published  by  the  sensor  fusion  and  collision  avoidance  do  not  have  a  key  value  since  there  is  only  one  instance  of  each  application.  the  lidar  samples  are  large  and  therefore  the  publisher  has  been  configured  as  an  asynchronous  publisher.  more  about  asynchronous  publishers  can  be  found
__label__productinspection in  the  rti  connext  core  libraries  user  manual.  the  cameraimagedata  samples  are  larger  than  the  lidar  samples,  with  a  default  size  of  4  mib  but  can  be  userconfigured  to  be  much  larger.  cameraimagedata  also  uses  an  asynchronous  publisher,  but  includes  the  buildable  options  of  using  the  new  flat  data  and/or  zero  copy  features  of  rti  connext  6.  flat  data  improves  performance  by  avoiding  some  datacopy  operations  during  the  transit  from  publisher  to  subscriber,  enabled  by  the  newer  xcdr2  encoding  of  the  data  samples.  zero  copy  is  available  for  shared  memory  transport  only,  but  offers  a  dramatic  performance  increase  by  passing
__label__productinspection pointers  to  the  large  data  samples  in  memory,  instead  of  passing  the  data  samples  themselves.  more  information  about  flat  data  and  zero  copy  can  be  found  in  the  rti  connext  core  libraries  user  manual.  sensor  data  is  expected  to  arrive  periodically.  therefore,  the  qos  settings  have  a  set  deadline.  the  only  exception  is  that  the  driver  alerts  do  not  have  a  deadline  set  since  alerts  do  not  happen  periodically.  the  deadline  for  the  writer  needs  to  be  set  higher  than  or  equal  to  the  reader.  in  the  qos  the  deadline  for  the  writers  is  set  to  11  seconds  and  the
__label__productinspection deadline  for  the  reader  is  set  to  10  seconds.  this  is  much  higher  than  what  you  would  expect  it  to  be  in  real  life.  however,  you  may  want  to  run  the  example  at  a  slower  speed  to  see  the  output.  therefore,  the  deadline  is  set  low  to  avoid  a  burst  of  deadline  missed  message  when  running  it  slower.  you  can  learn  more  about  deadlines  in  the  rti  connext  core  libraries  user  manual.  the  alert  topic  has  the  transient  local  property  set.  this  means  that  when  an  hmi  or  other  subscriber  starts  it  will  get  the  last  published  alert  status.  the
__label__productinspection property  is  set  to  one  which  means  that  the  subscriber  will  get  a  single  alert  status  when  starting.  the  liveliness  property  has  been  configured  to  1  minute.  this  is  so  that  the  hmi  or  any  subscriber  will  get  a  notification  if  the  writer  goes  away.  otherwise,  without  a  periodic  ping,  the  reader  would  not  know  if  the  writer  is  still  alive  or  not.  you  can  learn  more  about  liveliness  in  the  rti  connext  core  libraries  users  manual.  each  application  has  a  properties  file  with  some  basic  configuration.  here  is  an  example  of  a  properties  file:  datafilevision.csv  topic.sensorvisiontopic  qos.librarybuiltinqoslibexp  qos.profilegeneric.besteffort  config.sensorid1
__label__productinspection config.domainid0  config.pubinterval2000  not  all  applications  have  all  properties.  the  datafile  properties  specify  the  file  with  the  input  data  for  sensors.  the  application  will  read  the  values  from  this  file  and  use  it  to  populate  the  sensor  information.  it  will  wrap  around  at  the  end  and  restart  with  the  first  data  line  in  the  file.  the  topic  configuration  defines  the  topic  name  to  be  used.  the  subscriber  and  publisher  must  have  a  matching  topic  name.  the  qos  setting  defines  the  profiles  to  be  used.  you  can  create  your  own  userqosprofiles.xml  file  in  the  directory  and  list  the  profile  to  be  used

__label__productinspection iot  strategy  for  product  leaders  by  in  this  post,  i  present  an  iot  framework  to  help  product  managers  tackle  the  complexity  of  iot  products.  this  framework  provides  an  easytofollow  structure  to  uncoverrequirements  at  each  layer  of  the  iot  stack,  including  business  decisions,  technical  decisions,  and  more.  product  management  for  aninternet  of  things  product  can  be  very  daunting  and  confusing,  even  for  the  most  seasoned  product  managers.  thats  because  iot  products  are  more  complex  than  your  average  product,  since  you  need  to  consider  the  complexity  of  five  layers  of  technology:  device  hardware,  devicesoftware,  communications,  cloud  platform,  and  cloud  applications.  not  only
__label__productinspection do  you  need  to  make  critical  business  and  technical  decisions  at  each  of  these  five  layers,  but  you  need  to  make  surethis  myriad  ofdecisions  is  consistent  with  your  overall  strategy  and  consistent  across  the  five  layers.  to  help  product  managers  tackle  this  complexity,  i  developed  a  framework  i  call  the  iot  decision  framework.  this  iot  framework  provides  a  structured  approach  to  creating  a  robust  iot  product  strategy.  what  i  mean  by  that  is,  this  strategy  is  all  about  making  decisions.  the  iot  decision  framework  helps  you  understand  the  areas  where  you  need  to  make  decisions  and  ensures  consistency  across  all
__label__productinspection of  your  strategic  decisions.  ive  seen  it  firsthand  when  seasoned  product  managers  from  top  silicon  valley  companies  attend  my  ,  as  well  as  with  my  consultingclients.  throughout  my  courses,  participants  drastically  alter  their  product  strategies  as  they  workthrough  the  iot  decision  framework.  it  helps  them  uncoverquestionsthey  otherwise  would  not  have  consideredquestions  that  could  make  or  break  their  products.  to  get  started  with  the  iot  decision  framework,  lets  take  a  look  at  the  five  layers  of  the  iot  technolgy  stack.  the  greatestchallenge  of  managing  an  iot  solutionis  that  there  are  five  layers  in  the  iot  technology  stack,and  decisions  need  to  be
__label__productinspection made  at  each  layer.  in  myprevious  post,  ,  i  describe  these  five  layers  in  detail.  for  reference,  the  five  layers  are:  to  put  things  in  perspective,  asaas  application  only  includes  the  two  layers  onthe  right  side:  cloud  platform  and  cloud  applications.  those  two  layers  alone  are  usually  enough  to  keep  any  product  manager  on  their  toes.  so  you  can  imagine  how  adding  three  extra  layers  becomes  exponentially  more  complex  becauseyou  have  to  make  decisions  at  each  of  these  layers  and  make  sure  yourdecisions  are  consistent  across  all  five  layers.  as  an  iot  product  manager,  it  can  be  very  daunting  to
__label__productinspection know  where  to  start  or  how  to  organize  your  thoughts.  one  of  the  hardest  parts  is  knowing  which  questions  you  should  beasking.  the  iot  decision  framework  provides  you  with  a  and  navigate  across  the  various  departmentstomake  the  best  decisions  for  your  product.  think  of  it  as  a  map  to  help  you  discover  all  the  necessary  considerations  as  you  build  your  iotbusiness  plan,  roadmap,  backlog,  etc.  the  iot  decision  frameworkfocuses  on  six  key  decision  areas  you  need  to  consider  for  any  iot  product.  these  areas  are:  each  of  these  decision  areas  must  be  evaluated  at  each  layer  of  the  iot  technology
__label__productinspection stack.  youll  start  with  ux  and  work  with  your  teams  to  discover  what  makes  for  a  great  user  experience  at  thedevice  hardware  layer,  then  at  the  device  software  layer,  and  so  on.  then  you  can  move  to  the  data  decision  area  and  explore  data  considerations  for  your  device  hardware,  data  considerations  for  your  devicesoftware,  and  so  on.  once  you  are  done  with  the  data  decision  area  of  the  iot  framework,  you  can  move  to  the  business  decision  area.  you  get  the  idea.continue  through  the  framework  lefttoright  and  toptobottom  until  you  cover  all  areas.  i  know  this  sounds  like  a  lot
__label__productinspection of  work,  and  it  is.  but  believe  me,  youll  be  glad  you  spent  the  time  thinking  about  the  implications  of  all  decision  areas  throughout  the  iot  stack  before  you  start  building  anything.  thats  how  youll  create  a  consistent  product  strategy  and  learn  about  all  the  gaps  that  need  further  refining.  each  bubble  in  the  iot  decision  framework  is  an  opportunity  to  useproduct  management  tools  to  make  decisions  and  discover  gapstools  like  market  research,  design  research,  customer  development,  prioritization,  lean,  npi,  etc.  this  framework  is  not  a  replacement  for  any  of  those.  on  the  contrary,  it  provides  you  with  amap  and
__label__productinspection a  structure  for  your  discovery  process.  it  is  very  important  to  go  through  the  iot  framework  in  order.  each  of  the  decision  areas  are  organized  so  that  the  information  you  collect  in  one  area  informs  the  subsequent  area.  i  recommend  you  start  with  the  ux  decision  area  because  your  goal  is  to  understand  your  users  needs  first  and  then  move  to  the  other  decision  areas.  lets  take  a  closer  look  at  eachdecisionarea  of  the  iot  framework.  in  this  area,  you  need  to  understand  who  your  user  is,  what  their  needs  are,  and  what  would  make  for  a  great  experience  at
__label__productinspection each  layer  of  the  stack.  dont  worry  about  the  technical  details  at  this  point.  just  think  about  what  this  person  wants,  not  how  you  will  deliver  it.  plus,  youll  wantto  consider  the  needs  ofsecondary  users,  likeyour  internal  fleet  operations  team,  developer  partners,  sales  team,  installers,  and  more.  :  the  goal  of  the  data  decision  area  is  to  help  you  define  your  overall  data  strategy.  in  a  nutshell,  youneed  to  decidehow  data  shouldflow  through  the  stack  to  fulfill  the  users  needs.  for  example,  what  type  of  data  does  your  device  need  to  produce?  how  much  data  should  be  transmitted  to  the
__label__productinspection cloud  and  how  often?  do  youneed  to  perform  analytics  at  the  edge,  in  the  cloud,  or  both?  the  goal  of  the  business  decision  area  is  to  help  you  determine  whether  your  product  idea  has  financial  potential.  in  other  words,  will  you  be  able  to  make  money?  based  on  the  user  and  data  decisions  you  made  in  the  previous  decision  areas,  you  can  now  begin  to  make  business  decisions  that  will  feed  into  your  business  plan  and  financial  projections.  for  example,  youll  need  to  decide  your  overall  business  model  and  whichlayers  of  the  iot  technology  stack  you  will  monetize,  as  well
__label__productinspection asunderstand  the  costs  of  providing  your  service  at  each  layer  of  the  stack.  youll  also  make  critical  business  decisions  such  as  whether  to  build  or  buyeach  layer  of  the  stack  and  whether  to  open  apis.  based  on  the  decisions  you  made  in  all  previous  areas,  it  is  time  to  work  with  your  technology  teams  to  decide  what  technology  is  needed  at  each  layer  to  deliver  the  final  solution.  the  key  here  is  not  to  choose  the  technology  yourself,  but  to  provide  your  engineering  team  the  information  and  requirements  they  need  tochoose  the  best  technical  solutions.  together  withengineering,youll  identify  which  sensors,
__label__productinspection device  hardware,  and  device  software  areneeded.youll  design  a  communications  topology  and  decide  on  communications  protocols.  youll  work  with  your  team  to  choose  acloud  platform  based  on  data  needs  andperformance  requirements.  and  youll  decide  on  the  form  factors  of  your  cloud  applications  that  best  fit  your  users  needs.  once  youve  worked  with  your  teams  to  select  the  implementation  technology,  it  is  time  to  decide  how  to  secure  each  layer  of  the  stack.  the  goal  of  the  security  decision  area  is  to  help  you  think  about  how  each  layer  could  be  compromised  and  how  to  respond  when  your  devices  are  hacked.  youll
__label__productinspection also  need  to  decide  whether  youll  implement  security  testing  inhouse  or  with  a  vendor,  and  how  to  protect  your  product  from  being  hacked  from  inside  your  own  company  by  employees  or  unwanted  guests.  during  the  last  stage  of  my  iot  framework,  youll  identify  the  standards  and  regulations  that  will  affect  your  product  at  each  layer  of  the  stack,  based  onyour  type  of  product,  customer,  and  industry.  for  example,  does  your  industry  have  a  standard  data  format  or  communications  protocol  that  will  enableyour  product  to  talk  to  other  devices?do  your  customers  require  you  to  meetcertain  device  safety  or  cloud  security  requirements?what
__label__productinspection laws  must  your  product  comply  with  at  each  layer?  there  are  a  lot  of  decisions  that  you  will  need  to  make  during  the  life  of  your  product.  you  cant  expect  to  get  them  all  right  in  the  first  pass.  therefore,  its  important  for  you  to  iterate  several  times  throughout  the  iot  decision  framework  to  make  sure  you  find  a  balance  across  all  the  areas.  the  choicesyou  make  ineach  decision  area  and  iot  technology  stack  layer  will  impactall  of  the  other  decision  areas  and  stack  layers.  youll  need  to  iterate  several  times  across  the  frameworkbefore  you  reach  a  solution  that  is
__label__productinspection consistent  with  all  the  areas  and  has  considered  all  the  gaps.  for  example,  lets  say  that  in  the  datadecision  area,  you  decide  that  ideally,  your  product  would  provide  realtime  data  to  your  user.  in  thebusiness  area,  you  outline  the  costs  of  providingdevice  hardware,  devicesoftware,  and  a  cloud  platform  that  can  handle  realtime  data.  and  thats  when  you  realize  providing  this  service  will  cost  more  thanwhat  your  customer  is  willing  to  pay.  so  you  go  back  anddecidethat  receiving  data  once  per  minute  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  your  usersneeds.  then  you  work  through  the  ux,  business,  and  technology  decision  areas  once
__label__productinspection again  to  make  all  your  decisions  consistent  with  the  new  onceperminute  approach.  an  iot  product  is  more  of  a  system  than  a  standalone  product.  everything  is  interconnected.  by  using  this  framework,  you  can  make  sure  the  decisions  you  make  across  all  layers  are  consistent.  you  may  have  noticed  that  in  this  post,  im  only  including  the  iot  framework,  and  im  not  including  a  list  of  questions  that  you  should  answer  in  each  decision  area.  thats  becausethe  exact  questions  will  depend  entirely  on  your  industry,  application,  and  goals  for  the  particular  release  you  are  working  on.  for  example,  the  questions  youll
__label__productinspection need  to  answer  for  a  brand  new  product  or  mvp  will  be  very  different  from  the  questions  youll  need  to  answer  for  a  mature  product  or  even  for  a  version  2  product.  my  iot  framework  isintended  as  a  tool  to  help  you  organize  your  thoughts  and  come  up  withthe  questions  you  need  to  answer  as  you  developyour  product  strategy.  by  the  way,  if  you  need  more  help  figuring  out  the  questions  to  ask  or  would  like  to  go  deeper,  all  of  my  iot  courses  either  online  or  in  person  are  built  around  the  iot  decision  framework  as  a  way  to
__label__productinspection help  you  and  your  team  get  a  grip  on  your  iot  product  strategy  fast.  you  should  use  this  iot  framework  after  you  have  done  the  preliminary  product  work,  including  defining  yourtarget  audience,  detailing  your  value  proposition,  analyzing  competitors,  and  estimatingthe  revenue  opportunity.  once  you  have  a  solid  idea  of  how  an  iot  product  can  add  value  to  both  your  company  and  your  customers,  then  you  can  use  this  iot  framework  to  guide  you  through  the  decisions  you  will  need  to  make  at  each  layer  of  the  iot  technology  stack  to  support  your  overall  goals.  product  managers  are  accountable  for  having
__label__productinspection a  strong  and  consistent  product  strategy.  but  that  doesnt  mean  youshould  make  your  decisions  in  isolation.  this  iot  framework  gives  you  an  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  variousdepartments  to  develop  a  common  understanding  of  what  the  product  will  be.  start  by  identifying  who  needs  to  be  involved  in  creating  your  product  strategy.  lead  strategy  workshops  to  make  sure  everyone  is  aligned;  host  working  sessions  with  various  departments  ux,  engineering,  finance,  etc.to  gather  information,  generatequestions  for  the  framework,  and  discuss  options;  and  get  feedback  from  stakeholdersand  executives.  the  result  will  be  a  stronger,  more  consistent  strategy,  and  a  deeper  level  of  support
__label__productinspection from  your  peers  and  executives.  this  framework  can  be  used  both  with  consumer  iot  products  and  industrial  iot  products.  it  is  true  that  consumer  and  industrial  products  have  different  outcomes,  different  processes,  and  different  ecosystems.  although  the  process  for  creating  those  products  is  different,  the  process  of  creating  the  iot  product  strategy  is  the  same.  i  know  this  because  over  1,200  professionals  have  completed  my  and  have  taken  this  knowledge  in  all  industries,  verticals,  and  types  of  products.  the  iot  decision  framework  is  designed  to  help  you  with  product  strategy,  not  with  product  development.  however,  the  strategy  informs  your  development
__label__productinspection process,  so  you  need  to  understand  the  information  the  framework  provides  you  before  you  jump  into  any  development.  if  you  complete  each  component  of  the  iot  decision  framework,  your  team  will  have  a  much  better  sense  of  direction  for  your  product;  your  product  development  process  will  be  much  more  efficient,  and  you  will  deliver  products  to  market  faster  and  with  less  wasted  development  effort.  if  you  already  have  all  the  information,  it  can  take  as  little  as  an  hour  to  go  over  the  framework.  for  example,  if  you  know  who  your  target  audience  is,  have  identified  all  of  your  users,
__label__productinspection and  created  all  their  personas,  then  going  through  the  ux  decision  area  will  be  a  breeze.  the  same  is  true  for  all  the  other  decision  areas.  if  you  dont  have  the  information,  then  it  will  take  you  longer  to  complete  the  framework  because  you  have  to  complete  some  research.  that  is  one  of  the  biggest  benefits  of  using  a  framework:  the  iot  decision  framework  can  help  you  understand  where  you  need  to  conduct  research.  in  a  way,  it  will  provide  you  a  roadmap  for  your  product  team  on  what  research  activities  you  need  to  define,  where  you  need  buyin  from
__label__productinspection internal  stakeholders,  the  areas  you  need  to  discuss  with  engineering,  how  to  approach  security,  and  how  to  engage  your  policy  team.  its  not  about  how  long  it  takes  you  to  go  through  the  framework  itself.  its  about  understanding  all  of  the  questions  you  need  to  ask  and  how  to  create  a  product  strategy  that  can  lead  to  successful  market  fit.  no.  the  iot  decision  framework  intentionally  starts  with  the  ux  decision  area  because  from  a  product  management  perspective,  understanding  your  users  is  the  most  important  activity  you  can  do.  if  you  dont  understand  your  users  and  you  cant  articulate  their
__label__productinspection pain  points,  then  it  will  be  very  hard  to  create  a  data  strategy,  a  business  model,  or  a  technology  strategy.  many  companies  start  with  a  technologyfirst  approach,  meaning  they  develop  some  piece  of  technology  and  then  attempt  to  find  a  problem  their  product  solves.  but  that  approach  is  backward.  we  need  to  start  with  understanding  our  users,  and  from  there,  we  can  figure  out  how  the  users  needs  flow  throughout  the  rest  of  the  framework,  including  data  strategy,  business  models,  and  build  vs.  buy  strategy.  only  then  can  we  start  working  on  a  technical  solution.  remember,  product  management  is  about
__label__productinspection being  customerfocused,  not  technology  focused.  yes.  ive  included  several  templates  you  can  use  with  your  team  in  my  .  the  program  includes  my  iot  decision  workbook  which  is  a  companion  to  the  iot  decision  framework.  the  iot  strategy  template  is  a  powerpoint  template  you  can  use  to  summarize  the  findings  in  the  iot  decision  workbook,  so  you  can  communicate  with  other  stakeholders  in  your  company  and  articulate  the  product  strategy.  these  are  the  same  templates  i  use  with  my  consulting  clients  and  in  my  iot  pm  classes  at  stanford  university.  once  you  go  through  the  framework  you  will  have  all
__label__productinspection the  necessary  information  to  create  a  product  roadmap.  that  article  is  based  on  the  iot  decision  framework  and  will  give  you  the  steps  necessary  to  go  from  strategy  to  an  actual  roadmap.  iot  products  are  more  complex  than  most  other  technology  products.  using  the  iot  decision  framework  can  help  you  organize  your  thoughts,  identify  opportunities  and  pitfalls,  achieve  consensus,  and  release  the  rightsolution  faster.  i  really  wanted  to  keep  on  reading  i  am  going  to  certainly  pply  some  of  the  ideas  myself,  you  are  brilliant.  do  you  do  consultancy?  hi  daniel,  im  iot  product  manager  and  business  developer  in  toulouse
__label__productinspection france.  you  analysis  of  the  iot  market  is  so  true  this  article  and  alsopeople  dont  buy  iot,  they  buy  a  solution  to  a  problem.  you  exactly  demonstrate  what  i  think  since  two  years.  but  today  i  think  iot  major  company  destroyed  what  could  be  iot  by  adding  stupid  smart  think  to  product  that  dont  need  it.  everybody  install  iot  solution  but  they  dont  understand  what  to  expect  exception  to  the  fashion  around  this  technology.  so  there  are  a  lot  of  iot  proof  of  concept  but  at  least  nearly  nothing  is  deployed  at  a  large  scale.  you  should  send  this  framwork
__label__productinspection to  all  innovation  manager  in  large  company  and  incubator  .  they  need  to  think  deeply  and  think  again  about  problem  and  then  iot  solution  not  only  iot  technology.  thank  you  great  article.  i  feel  while  some  use  cases  will  be  useful  in  an  on  prem  scenario.  use  of  machine  learning  and  ai  will  require  cloud.  good  points  satish.  thank  you  for  your  comment.  thanks  for  sharing  very  much  useful.  great  work,  thank  you  for  sharing  thank  you  cameron.  very  helpful  framework  daniel,  just  listened  to  your  interview  on  the  iot  podcast.  ill  share  this  with  the  iot  auckland  meetup  group
__label__productinspection and  im  sure  it  will  help  educate  on  the  process  for  managing  an  iot  project.  thank  you  john.  im  glad  you  found  it  useful.  best,  daniel  thanks  for  sharing,  very  insightful  indeed.  thank  you  nasir.  great  stuff  daniel  looking  forward  to  hear  from  you  in  more  details  in  the  stanford  class  tonight..  good  stuff.  i  like  the  framework  and  the  5  levels.  although  i  think  the  cloud  is  the  right  way  to  categorize  that  level,  in  fact,  some  companies  will  still  have  onprem  for  some  applications  so  either  cloud  or  onprem  at  that  level.  very  thorough.  look  forward  to  following
__label__productinspection up  with  you.  chris  thank  you  for  your  comment  chris.  i  agree.  the  cloud  will  be  future  state,  but  we  will  see  many  implementations  along  the  way  as  companies  adapt  their  existing  technologies  and  infrastructure  to  the  concept  of  iot.  i  look  forward  to  following  up  with  you  as  well.  daniel  ask  all  the  right  questions?  ask  those  questions  in  the  right  order?  thats  where  theiot  decision  framework  bydaniel  elizalde  comes  in  and  does  a  great  copyright  2019  daniel  elizalde.  all  rights  reserved

__label__productinspection in  terms  of  the  firms  they  work  for  and  projects  they  work  on.  and  perhaps  most  importantly,  they  dont  like  to  be  pitched.  but,  make  no  mistake,  the  opportunity  is  enormous.  architects  and  engineers  offer  significant  benefits  in  terms  of  lifetime  value,  and  their  influence  on  professional  installers  and  endusers  is  unmatched.  to  be  successful,  iot  device  manufacturers  need  a  highly  focused  approach  to  capture  iot  market  share  and  create  a  product  specification  format  preference.  architects  are  a  unique  group.  they  need  to  be  when  it  comes  to  meeting  building  codes,  yet  they  can  see  the  big  picture  on  how
__label__productinspection their  designs  and  product  specifications  will  impact  major  enduser  concerns  such  as  energy  costs,  sustainability  and  total  cost  of  ownership.  engineers  take  a  methodical  approach  to  problem  solving.  they  value  evidencebased  data  and  rely  more  on  indepth  information,  data  sheets  and  modeling  tools  versus  a  manufacturers  blog  or  social  properties.  according  to  ,  they  want  information  instantly,  so  they  can  respond  to  their  clients  instantly.  if  a  manufacturer  doesnt  offer  an  online  tool  to  streamline  billable  hours,  then  the  manufacturer  may  be  missing  out.  its  critical  to  comprehend  these  motivators  and  drivers  when  it  comes  to  specification  decisions.  brands  can
__label__productinspection gain  a  competitive  advantage  by  identifying  segmentation  opportunities  within  the  vast  specification  world.  as  an  iot  marketer,  identify  how  you  can  target  ae  firms  who  are  focused  on  your  product  category  or  market  segment.  because  of  their  timecrunched  schedules,  research  suggests  that  architects  and  other  specifiers  are  creatures  of  habit  when  selecting  products.  according  to  a  aia  survey,  nearly  60  of  the  time  an  architect  already  knows  which  materials  manufacturer  he  or  she  is  going  to  use.  more  than  seven  in  10  architects  go  with  suppliers  with  whom  they  have  an  existing  relationship.  iot  device  manufacturers  that  dont  have  existing
__label__productinspection relationships  or  that  struggle  to  grow  existing  relationships  must  consider  a  differentiated  approach  in  order  to  disrupt  the  spec.  this  may  require  upfront  qualitative  research  to  understand  iot  perceptions  of  your  product  category  and  brand  within  the  iot  marketplace,  and  to  help  identify  displacement  opportunities  against  key  competitors.  the  connectivity  features  of  iot  devices  require  architects  and  engineers  to  place  even  more  emphasis  on  writing  specifications  with  building  management  systems  in  mind.  long  gone  are  the  days  when  products  were  specified  only  because  of  what  they  could  do  or  how  they  looked.  today,  specifiers  strive  to  meet  building  owners  needs

__label__productinspection in  1926,  inventor  and  futurist  nikola  tesla  remarked  upon  the  potential  power  of  wireless  technology  to  eliminate  social  problems  arising  out  of  the  natural  distance  that  exists  between  individuals  and  groups  of  people:  when  wireless  is  perfectly  applied  the  whole  earth  will  be  converted  into  a  huge  brain,  which  in  fact  it  is,  all  things  being  particles  of  the  real  and  rhythmic  whole.  we  shall  be  able  to  communicate  with  one  another  instantly,  irrespective  of  distance  and  the  instruments  through  which  we  shall  be  able  to  do  this  will  be  amazingly  simple  compared  with  our  present  telephone.  nikola  tesla  ,
__label__productinspection nikola  tesla,  age  34,  1890  the  accuracy  of  nikola  teslas  vision  for  the  way  emerging  technology  would  shape  and  connect  our  world  is  remarkable.  but  beyond  his  vision  of  connectivity  between  people,  and  even  between  people  and  objects,  technological  advances  have  expanded  into  the  realm  of  communication  between  objects  themselves  and  the  surrounding  environment.  from  thermostats  that  learn  our  daily  routines  to  cars  that  receive  crucial  safety  feature  updates  overtheair,  everyday  objects  are  more  connected  than  ever  before.  developing  new  products  with  the  complexity  of  intelligent  communication  can  be  a  daunting  process,  so  our  goal  with  this  guide  is  to
__label__productinspection make  it  less  so.  in  this  guide,  were  going  to  provide  a  thorough  introduction  of  the  internet  of  things  iot  to  help  you  get  started,  with  an  indepth  look  at  the  following  topics:  feel  free  to  jump  straight  to  sections  that  answer  your  most  pressing  questions  or,  of  course,  read  the  entire  guide  straight  through.  lets  dive  in  in  1991,  eight  years  before  the  term  internet  of  things  was  coined  by  british  technology  entrepreneur  ,  computer  scientist  wrote  about  his  idea  of  ubiquitous  computing  in  an  .  he  predicted  that  as  computer  technology  developed,  it  would  become  more  and  more
__label__productinspection a  part  of  our  reality.  highlyconnected  computers  would  essentially  disappear  into  an  invisible  background  of  intelligent  objects  that  surround  and  enhance  our  productivity,  social  interactions,  and  general  wellbeing.  the  real  power  of  the  concept  comes  not  from  any  one  of  these  devices;  it  emerges  from  the  interaction  of  all  of  them,  says  weiser.  the  xerox  palo  alto  research  center,  at  the  center  of  personal  computing  research  and  development  in  the  mid  1970s  image  in  2004,  scientific  american  published  a  feature  titled  .  the  authors  of  this  article  proposed  the  concept  of  an  internet0,  wherein  a  single  standard  data  network  would
__label__productinspection allow  many  common  objects  in  a  home  or  office  to  communicate  with  each  other,  the  surrounding  environment,  or  other  existing  data  networks,  thereby  reducing  networking  complexity  and  improving  services  like  home  healthcare.  the  article  suggests  an  opensource  data  transmission  paradigm  where  the  speed  of  communication  is  sacrificed  for  the  broader  goal  of  flexibility  and  device  interoperability.  the  article  also  echoes  mark  weisers  sentiment  of  ubiquitous  computing  proposed  ten  years  earlier:  the  ultimate  destiny  of  internet0  is  not  just  turning  on  the  lights.  an  i0  network  will  be  indistinguishable  from  the  computers  that  it  connects;  it  really  will  be  the  computer.
__label__productinspection today,  the  number  of  connected  objects  in  our  world  is  growing  rapidly.  ,  the  current  number  of  iot  devices  is  on  the  order  of  4.9  billion,  with  projected  estimates  of  that  figure  growing  fivefold  or  more  by  2020.  we  have  already  seen  the  success  of  home  automation  begin  to  take  place,  with  devices  like  the  nest  thermostat  successfully  adopted  by  a  relatively  large  number  of  consumers  in  early  2014,  were  being  sold  per  month,  and  the  company  was  acquired  by  google  for  3.2  billion  in  early  2015.  nest  iot  thermostat  image  source  the  leading  market  in  terms  of  number  of
__label__productinspection devices  currently  in  use  is  by  far  the  consumer  product  sector,  but  automotive  industry  applications  are  projected  to  be  among  the  fastest  growing  sectors  in  the  coming  years.  at  the  heart  of  the  technology  that  drives  iot  products  is  wireless  radio  communication.  the  vast  majority  of  wireless  devices  that  we  uselike  routers,  wireless  cameras,  and  bluetooth  headsetsoperate  by  transmitting  data  from  one  location  to  the  next  using  radio  waves  as  a  medium.  many  common  technologies,  including  wifi,  bluetooth  /  bluetooth  le,  ant,  and  6lowpan  operate  around  the  2.4ghz  frequency  band;  this  is  one  of  the  bands  of  radio  frequencies  designated
__label__productinspection for  use  by  the  fcc  for  industrial,  scientific,  and  medical  or  ism  applications.  the  fcc  provides  a  illustrating  the  designated  purposes  for  various  regions  of  the  radio  spectrum.  there  are  two  main  challenges  with  wireless  data  communication:  radio  interference  and  free  space  path  loss.  one  of  the  potential  problems  with  having  many  devices  operate  concurrently  and  in  close  proximity  with  each  other  within  the  same  frequency  range  is  radio  interference.  in  order  to  maintain  stable  connections  in  the  increasingly  crowded  ism  band,  some  wireless  devices  employ  a  method  of  adaptation  called  frequency  hopping  spread  spectrum  fhss.  using  this  method,  the
__label__productinspection transmitter  and  receiver  randomly  change  the  subfrequency  upon  which  the  signal  is  carried,  thereby  limiting  the  amount  of  overall  disruption  in  transmission  that  might  occur  due  to  interference  on  any  given  channel.  interference  image  source  bluetooth  uses  a  variation  of  this  method  known  as  adaptive  frequency  hopping  afh.  the  basic  concept  of  afh  is  that  bluetooth  can  identify  fixed  channels  which  cause  interference  and  systematically  avoid  them  by  designating  the  identified  range  as  unavailable.  other  technologies,  such  as  zwave,  use  an  ism  band  around  the  900  mhz  range,  often  referred  to  as  the  subghz  band.  some  advantages  of  operating  at
__label__productinspection a  lower  frequency  include  potentially  lower  power  consumption,  fewer  sources  of  interference,  and  increased  range.  signal  power  is  attenuated  as  it  travels  through  space  due  to  geometric  spreading  of  the  wave  front,  a  phenomenon  called  .  imagine  the  signal  power  as  spread  out  over  a  given  area.  as  the  signal  propagates  through  space,  this  area  increases  rapidly,  effectively  decreasing  the  power  density  of  the  signal.  as  mentioned  above,  lower  frequencies  theoretically  maintain  signal  strength  over  longer  distances.  this  is  illustrated  by  the  free  space  path  loss  formula,  which  gives  the  theoretical  power  of  a  signal  received  by  a  receiver  from
__label__productinspection a  transmitter  some  distance  away:  here,  is  the  signal  frequency  hz,  is  the  distance  between  the  transmitter  and  the  receiver  of  the  signal  meters,  and  is  the  speed  of  light  meters  per  second.  higher  frequencies  produce  significantly  higher  free  space  losses.  of  course,  there  are  many  contributing  factors  beyond  distance  travelled  and  signal  frequency  to  determine  actual  signal  strength  for  any  given  application.  generally,  the  fspl  formula  is  used  to  determine  signal  strength  as  part  of  the  .  it  incorporates  the  power  gains  provided  by  the  antennas  in  a  wireless  system  and  provides  an  estimate  of  the  power  received  by

__label__productinspection radio  waves  in  the  air.  while  a  full  review  of  the  link  budget  analysis  technique  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  article,  its  important  to  know  that  the  signal  power  may  be  affected  by  many  factors,  including:  regulating  institutions  also  impose  limits  on  the  maximum  amount  of  link  power  that  can  be  legally  transmitted  from  radio  devices.  for  an  introduction  to  fcc  regulations  on  lowpower  transmitters  such  as  those  used  in  many  iot  products,  see  .  okay  now  that  weve  reviewed  the  general  principles  of  wireless  data  communication,  lets  review  and  compare  several  of  the  most  common  wireless  protocols  used
__label__productinspection in  iot  product  development.  there  are  dozens  of  existing  solutions  to  choose  from  when  selecting  a  wireless  protocol  to  establish  connectivity  for  your  device.  each  have  specific  advantages,  disadvantages,  and  precedent  in  existing  applications,  so  lets  review  each  of  them,  starting  with  the  3  most  common:  bluetooth/bluetooth  low  energy,  wifi,  and  cellular.  often,  bluetoothtype  networks  are  referred  to  as  personal  area  networks,  or  pan,  and  in  terms  of  shortrange  device  communication,  bluetooth  is  a  very  popular  technology  standard.  the  zuli  smartplug  uses  bluetooth  to  control  lights  and  appliances  from  a  smartphone  image  source  bluetooth  operates  over  shortwavelength  radio  waves  in
__label__productinspection the  band  from  2.4  ghz  to  2.485  ghz  and  can  connect  several  devices  from  a  master  bluetooth  device.  a  master  device  can  provide  a  miniature  network  supporting  up  to  seven  devices.  one  of  the  main  advantages  of  bluetooth  over  wifi  or  cellular  is  its  low  power  consumption.  bluetooth  is  designed  for  relatively  low  bandwidths  and  short  ranges  and  therefore  requires  less  power  to  send  and  receive  data.  bluetooth  low  energy  bluetooth  le,  also  known  as  bluetooth  smart,  is  a  wireless  technology  that  provides  similar  performance  to  bluetooth,  but  at  an  even  lower  power  and  cost.  note  that  bluetooth  le  is
__label__productinspection not  backwardscompatible  with  standard  bluetooth,  although  devices  may  support  both  technologies.  this  means  that  a  dualmode  device  would  need  both  a  bluetooth  radio  and  a  bluetooth  le  radio  to  operate.  as  mentioned  previously,  both  bluetooth  and  bluetooth  le  utilize  a  technique  known  as  adaptive  frequency  hopping  to  minimize  interference  from  other  signals  sharing  a  similar  radio  frequency  band.  bluetooth  le  uses  a  different  frequency  hopping  scheme  than  classic  bluetooth,  but  the  basic  ideaminimizing  interference  and  maximizing  stabilityis  the  same.  the  range  for  both  bluetooth  and  bluetooth  le  is  theoretically  limited  to  approximately  330  feet,  although  most  applications  of  these  technologies
__label__productinspection are  used  in  a  closer  range.  as  both  standards  use  radio  waves  for  data  communication,  connected  devices  can  be  separated  by  substantial  distance  and  matter;  the  effective  range  will  be  limited  by  device  power  and  sources  of  signal  interference.  topologically,  bluetooth  and  bluetooth  le  operate  as  pointtopoint  or  star  networks.  so  between  one  and  seven  devices  in  the  network  connect  to  a  central  hub.  this  topology  has  advantages  and  disadvantages.  if  the  central  node  fails,  then  it  breaks  communication  with  all  of  the  dependent  devices.  the  primary  advantage  of  this  architecture,  however,  is  that  it  provides  a  simple,  stable  connection
__label__productinspection between  the  hub  and  any  of  its  given  connected  devices.  probably  the  most  common  wireless  connectivity  technology  currently  in  use,  wifi  is  a  wireless  local  area  network  lan  that  operates  on  radio  bands  in  the  range  of  2.5ghz  and  5ghz.  the  related  technology  wifi  direct  is  a  product  that  enables  wifi  devices  to  connect  directly  to  each  other  without  the  need  for  a  traditional  wifi  network.  smart  city  initiatives,  as  seen  in  barcelona,  for  example,  include  public  wifi  internet  access  points  on  all  public  transportation  and  at  points  covering  the  entire  city,  available  for  use  by  local  citizens.  is  an
__label__productinspection iot  product  that  connects  to  home  wifi  compared  with  bluetooth,  wifi  generally  requires  greater  power  to  operate.  additionally,  since  wifi  is  used  most  commonly  on  devices  with  user  interfaces  such  as  laptops,  tablets,  and  smartphones,  connecting  a  device  is  done  via  the  existing  user  interface.  many  iot  products,  however,  may  not  have  builtin  user  interfaces  in  the  same  sense  as  a  laptop  screen  running  an  operating  system.  so  creative  methodssuch  as  wifi  protected  setup  wps  with  pushbuttonconnect  or  access  point  modemay  be  required  to  connect  iot  wifi  products.  that  said,  wifi  is  actively  being  developed  and  the  wireless  networking  standards
__label__productinspection implemented  in  wifi  devices  are  currently  being  improved  to  support  perceived  requirements  of  a  robust  internet  of  things,  including  lower  power  consumption  and  extended  range.  cellular  technology  differs  perhaps  most  distinctly  from  technologies  like  bluetooth  and  wifi  in  that  its  a  wide  area  network  wan,  with  a  practically  global  range.  smartphones  connect  to  the  internet  via  cellular  towers  in  addition  to  wifi  image  cellular  data  networks  allow  devices  to  connect  to  the  internet  by  means  of  cellular  towers  and  interworking  functions  iwf.  the  iwf  systems  in  place  on  a  cellular  carriers  network  receive  data  from  cell  towers  and  route  it
__label__productinspection to  the  internet.  conversely,  the  iwf  also  receives  data  from  the  internet  and  routes  it  to  the  relevant  cell  tower  communicating  with  a  cellular  device.  the  cost  of  setting  up  a  cellular  connection  with  a  new  product  is  generally  higher  than  other  methods;  if  using  a  wellknown  national  carrier,  contracts  and  monthly  charges  are  often  required.  product  certification  is  also  generally  significantly  more  expensive  than  other  wireless  technologies,  and  may  have  longer  lead  times.  power  consumption  is  another  major  drawbacks  of  cellular  methods  for  consumer  iot  devices.  cellular  devices  need  frequent  recharging,  whereas  lowpower,  short  range  devices  that  use  alternative
__label__productinspection wireless  technologies  may  operate  for  months  or  even  years  without  requiring  a  charge.  the  most  significant  benefit  of  cellular  devices  for  iot  is  that  data  can  be  transmitted  reliably  over  exceptionally  long  ranges  when  compared  with  other  alternatives.  another  potential  benefit  of  cellular  iot  devices  is  that  the  infrastructure  used  to  carry  the  data  from  cellular  devices  over  the  network  is  managed  by  cellular  carriers,  rather  than  the  device  manufacturer.  therefore,  support  costs  and  connectivity  reliability  concerns  may  be  lower.  now  lets  review  some  popular  alternatives  to  the  three  most  common  wireless  communication  technologies.  ant  is  a  proprietary  network  technology
__label__productinspection designed  to  operate  on  the  same  2.4  ghz  ism  band  as  other  common  wireless  technology.  ant  appears  most  commonly  in  wearables  and  fitnessoriented  products,  like  heart  rate  monitors,  calorimeters,  blood  pressure  monitors,  and  cadence  sensors.  garmin  watches  uses  ant  to  transmit  data  from  the  device  to  a  users  computer  image  with  similar  range,  power  requirements,  and  data  transmission  rates  to  bluetooth  smart,  ant  distinguishes  itself  by  using  a  simple  protocol  and  wider  range  of  network  topologies  available,  including  tree  and  mesh  configurations.  6lowpan,  or  ipv6  over  low  power  wireless  personal  area  networks,  is  a  set  of  standards  developed  by  the
__label__productinspection internet  engineering  task  force  ietf  with  the  idea  of  enabling  ultralow  power,  lowprocessing  capability  devices  and  sensors  to  operate  over  lowbandwidth  wireless  networks.  perhaps  the  first  communication  technology  developed  specifically  for  iot,  its  still  a  relatively  new  technology  compared  with  bluetooth  and  wifi.  zwave  technology  is  a  lowpower  wireless  communications  protocol  designed  specifically  for  home  automation.  openzwave  is  an  opensource,  free  library  for  use  with  zwave  devices.  danalock  smart  lock  is  both  bluetooth  and  zwave  compatible  image  it  operates  in  the  sub1ghz  band,  and  therefore  is  not  prone  to  interference  from  other  more  common  wireless  technologies  that  operate  in  the
__label__productinspection ism  band.  it  uses  a  type  of  mesh  network  topology  with  one  primary  controller.  this  means  devices  can  communicate  with  each  other  using  other  devices  in  the  network  as  nodes.  so  even  if  two  devices  are  not  in  range,  an  intermediate  device  within  range  of  both  the  start  and  endpoints  may  be  used  to  relay  the  communication.  weightless  is  an  open  wireless  technology  standard  for  lowpower  wide  area  networks.  its  designed  with  machinetomachine  communication  in  mind  for  relatively  long  ranges  of  up  to  10  km.  weightless  has  been  adopted  primarily  by  industrial  applications  like  vehicle  tracking  and  electric  meters.  the
__label__productinspection technology  utilizes  the  tv  channels  band,  operating  in  the  range  of  frequencies  allocated  to  television  broadcasting  but  unused  within  a  certain  geographic  location  known  as  the  white  space.  when  designing  objects  for  connectivity,  there  are  several  important  features  that  will  require  detailed  consideration  tailored  to  the  unique  needs  of  your  product.  one  of  the  first  features  you  should  consider  is  power  consumption.  a  question  to  consider  here:  note  that  wifi  and  cellular  consume  significantly  greater  power  than  bluetooth,  bluetooth  le,  zwave,  and  other  lowerbandwidth,  shorter  range  technologies.  results  from  a  that  compared  the  power  consumption  of  bluetooth  le,  zigbee,  and
__label__productinspection ant  sensors  demonstrated  that  determining  the  power  consumption  for  these  modules  depends  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  sleep  cycle  intervals.  portable  devices  like  the  pocketlab  that  connect  to  a  smartphone  app  work  well  with  bluetooth/bluetooth  le  as  a  low  power  consumption  technology  image  overall,  bluetooth  le  was  shown  to  achieve  the  lowest  power  consumption  of  the  three  protocols  tested  in  this  study.  its  also  important  to  consider  what  type  of  operating  range  your  product  needs.  for  example,  does  your  device  need  to  be  able  to  communicate  with  a  hospital  ten  miles  away  or  just  within  a  single  household  or
__label__productinspection office  space?  or  perhaps  is  it  a  wearable  device  that  only  needs  to  communicate  with  a  smartphone  carried  by  the  user?  defining  the  required  operating  range  will  help  you  choose  the  right  wireless  technology  for  your  product.  in  the  us,  the  federal  communications  commision  fcc  regulates  radio  frequencies  rf,  allocating  a  range  of  frequency  bands  for  nongovernmental  use.  so  the  fcc  is  the  organization  that  certifies  new  rf  equipment  to  ensure  it  complies  with  standard  rf  technical  requirements  before  the  product  goes  to  market.  the  overall  design  of  a  device,  including  its  antenna  design,  layout,  and  electrical  circuitry  must  be

__label__productinspection the  key:  finding  insights  in  data.  explore  with  a  wave  of  investment,  a  raft  of  new  products,  and  a  rising  tide  of  enterprise  deployments,  artificial  intelligence  is  making  a  splash  in  the  internet  of  things  iot.  companies  crafting  an  iot  strategy,  evaluating  a  potential  new  iot  project,  or  seeking  to  get  more  value  from  an  existing  iot  deployment  may  want  to  explore  a  role  for  ai.  artificial  intelligence  is  playing  a  growing  role  in  iot  applications  and  deployments,  a  shift  apparent  in  the  behavior  of  companies  operating  in  this  area.  venture  capital  investments  in  iot  startups  that  are  using  ai
__label__productinspection are  up  sharply.  companies  have  acquired  dozens  of  firms  working  at  the  intersection  of  ai  and  iot  in  the  last  two  years.  and  major  vendors  of  iot  platform  software  are  now  offering  integrated  ai  capabilities  such  as  machine  learningbased  analytics.  ai  is  playing  a  starring  role  in  iot  because  of  its  ability  to  quickly  wring  insights  from  data.  machine  learning,  an  ai  technology,  brings  the  ability  to  automatically  identify  patterns  and  detect  anomalies  in  the  data  that  smart  sensors  and  devices  generateinformation  such  as  temperature,  pressure,  humidity,  air  quality,  vibration,  and  sound.  companies  are  finding  that  machine  learning  can  have
__label__productinspection significant  advantages  over  traditional  business  intelligence  tools  for  analyzing  iot  data,  including  being  able  to  make  operational  predictions  up  to  20  times  earlier  and  with  greater  accuracy  than  thresholdbased  monitoring  systems.  and  other  ai  technologies  such  as  speech  recognition  and  computer  vision  can  help  extract  insight  from  data  that  used  to  require  human  review.  the  powerful  combination  of  ai  and  iot  technology  is  helping  companies  avoid  unplanned  downtime,  increase  operating  efficiency,  enable  new  products  and  services,  and  enhance  risk  management.  in  a  number  of  sectors,  unplanned  downtime  resulting  from  equipment  breakdown  can  cause  heavy  losses.  for  instance,  according  to  one
__label__productinspection study,  such  losses  average  38  million  annually  for  offshore  oil  and  gas  operators.  another  source  estimated  that  for  industrial  manufacturing  in  total,  unplanned  downtime  costs  50  billion  per  year,  with  equipment  failure  being  the  cause  for  42  percent  of  the  outages.  predictive  maintenceusing  analytics  to  predict  equipment  failure  ahead  of  time  in  order  to  schedule  orderly  maintenance  procedurescan  mitigate  the  damaging  economics  of  unplanned  downtime.  in  manufacturing,  for  instance,  deloitte  finds  that  predictive  maintenance  can  reduce  the  time  required  to  plan  maintenance  by  2050  percent,  increase  equipment  uptime  and  availability  by  1020  percent,  and  reduce  overall  maintenance  costs  by  510
__label__productinspection percent.  because  ai  technologiesparticularly  machine  learningcan  help  identify  patterns  and  anomalies  and  make  predictions  based  on  large  sets  of  data,  they  are  proving  to  be  particularly  useful  in  implementing  predictive  maintenance.  leading  south  korean  oil  refiner  sk  innovation,  for  example,  expects  to  save  billions  of  won  by  using  machine  learning  to  predict  failure  of  connected  compressors.  similarly,  italian  train  operator  trenitalia  expects  to  avoid  unplanned  downtime  and  save  810  percent  on  its  1.3  billion  annual  maintenance  costs.  meanwhile,  french  power  utility  edf  group  has  already  saved  over  1  million  with  machine  learningdriven  early  warning  on  equipment  failure.  aipowered  iot  can
__label__productinspection do  more  than  help  avoid  unplanned  downtime.  it  can  also  help  improve  operational  efficiency.  this  is  due  in  part  to  the  power  of  machine  learning  to  generate  fast  and  precise  predictions  and  deepinsightsand  to  ai  technologies  ability  to  automate  a  growing  variety  of  tasks.  for  example,  for  hershey,  managing  the  weight  of  their  products  during  the  production  process  is  critical:  every  1  percent  improvement  in  weight  precision  can  mean  more  than  500,000  in  savings  for  a  14,000gallon  batch  of  product  such  as  twizzlers.  the  company  used  iot  and  machine  learning  to  significantly  reduce  weight  variability  during  production.  data  is  captured
__label__productinspection and  analyzed  by  the  second,  and  weight  variability  can  be  predicted  by  machine  learning  models,  enabling  240  process  adjustments  per  day,  compared  to  just  12  per  day  before  the  mlpowered  iot  solution  was  installed.  aibased  prediction  is  also  helping  google  cut  40  percent  of  data  center  cooling  costs.  the  solution,  trained  on  data  from  sensors  in  the  facility,  predicts  temperature  and  pressure  over  the  next  hour  to  guide  actions  for  limiting  power  consumption.  machine  learning  produced  insights  that  persuaded  one  shipping  fleet  operator  to  take  a  counter  intuitive  action  that  saved  them  big  money.  data  collected  from  shipboard  sensors  was
__label__productinspection used  to  identify  the  correlation  between  the  amount  of  money  spent  on  cleaning  the  ships  hulls  and  fuel  efficiency.  the  analysis  showed  that  by  cleaning  their  ships  hulls  twice  a  year  rather  than  every  two  yearsand  thereby  quadrupling  their  cleaning  budgetthey  would  end  up  saving  400,000  due  to  greater  fuel  efficiency.  iot  technology  coupled  with  ai  can  form  the  foundation  of  improved  and  eventually  entirely  new  products  and  services  as  well.  for  instance,  for  ges  drone  and  robotbased  industrial  inspection  services,  the  company  is  looking  to  ai  to  automate  both  navigation  of  inspection  devices  and  identification  of  defects  from  the
__label__productinspection data  captured  by  them.  this  could  result  in  safer,  more  precise,  and  up  to  25  percent  cheaper  inspections  for  the  client.  in  health  care,  thomas  jefferson  university  hospital  in  philadelphia  seeks  to  improve  patient  experience  with  natural  language  processing  that  will  enable  patients  to  control  room  environment  and  request  various  information  with  voice  commands.  meanwhile,  rollsroyce  aims  to  soon  introduce  a  new  offering  featuring  iotenabled  airplane  engine  maintenance  services.  the  company  plans  to  use  machine  learning  to  help  it  spot  patterns  and  identify  operational  insights  that  will  be  sold  to  airlines.  and  automotive  manufacturer  navistar  is  looking  to  machine  learning
__label__productinspection analysis  of  realtime  connected  vehicle  data  to  enable  a  new  revenue  stream,  in  vehicle  health  diagnostics  and  predictive  maintenance  services.  according  to  navistar  technology  partner  cloudera,  these  services  have  helped  cut  downtime  for  nearly  300,000  vehicles  by  up  to  40  percent.  a  number  of  applications  pairing  iot  with  ai  are  helping  organizations  better  understand  and  predict  a  variety  of  risks  as  well  as  automate  for  rapid  response,  enabling  them  to  better  manage  worker  safety,  financial  loss,  and  cyber  threats.  for  instance,  fujitsu  has  piloted  the  use  of  machine  learning  to  analyze  data  from  connected  wearable  devices  to  estimate  its  factory
__label__productinspection workers  potentially  threatening  heat  stress  accumulated  over  time.  banks  in  india  and  north  america  have  begun  evaluating  aienabled  realtime  identification  of  suspicious  activities  from  connected  surveillance  cameras  at  atms.  vehicle  insurer  progressive  is  using  machine  learning  analysis  of  data  from  connected  cars  to  accurately  price  its  usagebased  insurance  premiums  and  thus  better  manage  underwriting  risk.  and  the  city  of  las  vegas  has  turned  to  a  machine  learning  solution  to  secure  its  smart  city  initiatives,  aimed  at  automatically  detecting  and  responding  to  threats  in  real  time.  for  enterprises  across  industries,  ai  has  the  potential  to  boost  the  value  created  by  iot
__label__productinspection deployments,  enabling  better  offerings  and  operations  to  give  a  competitive  edge  in  business  performance.  executives  contemplating  new  iotbased  projects  should  be  aware  that  machine  learning  for  predictive  capabilities  is  now  integrated  with  most  major  horizontal  in  other  words,  generalpurpose  and  industrial  iot  platforms,  such  as  microsoft  azure  iot,  ibm  watson  iot,  amazon  aws  iot,  ge  predix,  and  ptc  thingworx.  a  growing  number  of  turnkey,  bundled,  or  vertical  iot  solutions  take  advantage  of  ai  technologies  such  as  machine  learning.  for  instance,  for  connectedcar  use  cases,  bmws  cardata  platform  gives  access  to  data  shared  by  vehicle  owners  and  ai  capabilities  from  ibm
__label__productinspection watson  iot.  in  consumer  products  and  retail,  a  number  of  replenishment  automation  and  optimization  solutions  use  machine  learning  to  predict  demand  and  optimize  inventory  levels.  providers  of  telematics  solutions  for  the  auto  insurance  industry  are  integrating  machine  learning  to  create  more  accurate  risk  models  and  predict  claims  behavior.  it  may  be  possible  to  use  ai  technology  to  wring  more  value  from  iot  deployments  that  were  not  designed  with  the  use  of  ai  in  mind.  for  instance,  a  hungarian  oil  and  gas  company  applied  machine  learning  to  sensor  data  that  was  already  being  collected  during  diesel  fuel  production.  the  analysis  allowed
__label__productinspection the  company  to  more  accurately  predict  the  fuels  sulfur  content  and  helped  identify  process  improvements  that  are  now  saving  the  company  more  than  600,000  per  year.  the  major  horizontal  and  industrial  iot  platformswhich  enterprises  may  already  be  usingare  offering  new  aibased  capabilities  that  might  help  boost  the  value  of  existing  deployments.  it  may  soon  become  rare  to  find  an  iot  implementation  that  does  not  make  some  use  of  ai.  the  international  data  corp.  predicts  that  by  2019,  ai  will  support  all  effective  iot  efforts  and  without  ai,  data  from  the  deployments  will  have  limited  value.  a  growing  number  of  iot
__label__productinspection vendors  are  offering  at  least  basic  ai  support.  vanguard  companies  across  industries  are  already  reaping  the  benefits  of  ai  in  their  iot  deployments.  if  your  company  has  plans  for  implementing  iotbased  solutions,  those  plans  should  probably  include  ai  as  well.  analyzes  emerging  technology  and  business  trends  for  deloittes  leaders  and  clients.  he  is  based  in  new  york.  works  with  deloitte  services  india  pvt.  ltd.  she  is  based  in  mumbai.  is  a  senior  analyst  at  deloitte  services  india  pvt.  ltd.  he  is  based  in  mumbai.  the  authors  would  like  to  thank:  ragu  gurumurthy  ,  chief  innovation  officer  and  chief  digital  officer,

__label__productinspection the  smartphoneenabling  technologies  such  as  builtin  sensors,  bluetooth,  radiofrequency  identification  rfid  tracking,  and  nearfield  communications  nfc  allow  it  to  be  an  integral  part  of  iot  and  ioe  world  and  the  mostly  used  device  in  these  environments.  however,  its  use  imposes  severe  security  and  privacy  threats,  because  the  smartphone  usually  contains  and  communicates  sensitive  private  data.  in  this  chapter,  we  provide  a  comprehensive  survey  on  iot  and  ioe  technologies,  their  application  domains,  iot  structure  and  architecture,  the  use  of  smartphones  in  iot  and  ioe,  and  the  difference  between  iot  networks  and  mobile  cellular  networks.  we  also  provide  a  concise  overview  of
__label__productinspection future  opportunities  and  challenges  in  iot  and  ioe  environments  and  focus  more  on  the  security  and  privacy  threats  of  using  the  smartphone  in  iot  and  ioe  networks  with  a  suggestion  of  some  countermeasures.  address  all  correspondence  to:  mehdia.ajanagmail.com  doi:  10.5772/intechopen.69734  edited  by  nawaz  mohamudally  the  internet  of  things  iot  is  a  network  of  intelligent  devices  ranging  from  home  appliances  to  industrial  equipment  that  can  become  connected  to  the  internet,  monitor  themselves,  send  contextual  information  such  as  pressure,  location,  and  temperature,  and  communicate  somehow,  anytime,  anywhere  on  the  planet  e.g.,  a  milk  carton  sending  sensor  and  identification  information  to  a  radiofrequency
__label__productinspection identification  rfid  reader  when  the  temperature  is  getting  higher  than  a  threshold  or  when  the  milk  carton  is  moved  to  a  hot  place  .  iot  means  connecting  anyone,  anything,  anytime,  anyplace,  any  service  and  any  network  .  the  concept  of  iot  has  been  extended  by  cisco  to  internet  of  everything  ioe  to  include  in  addition  to  things  machinetomachine  m2m,  people  technologyassisted  peopletopeople  p2p  and  processes  machinetopeople  m2p  interactions  .  cisco  defines  internet  of  everything  ioe  as  the  intelligent  connection  of  people,  process,  data  and  things  ,  englobing  interactions  and  communications  generated  by  users  while  using  a  variety  of  networked  devices
__label__productinspection e.g.,  if  a  person  forgot  if  s/he  left  the  oven  on  at  home,  s/he  wouldnt  have  to  run  back  home  to  check  it  as  s/he  could  just  use  a  specific  application  and  do  it  remotely  using  her/his  smartphone  .  the  proliferation  of  mobile  connectivity  and  the  decreasing  prices  of  sensors  and  processors  are  encouraging  the  rapid  growth  of  the  iot  and  ioe.  smart  devices,  for  example,  smartphones,  smartwatches,  pdas,  phablets,  and  tablets,  will  be  the  primary  interaction  tools  used  by  people  in  a  connected  environment  including  cars,  homes,  and  workplaces.  gartner  expects  in  that  the  number  of  connected  things  and
__label__productinspection devices  to  rise  to  25  billion  by  2020  while  other  more  aggressive  estimates  put  the  figure  at  50  billion  .  for  this  to  be  realized  we  need  to  have  devices  that  are  not  only  smart  but  should  be  able  to  access  the  internet  without  being  connected  to  a  physical  local  area  network  lan  or  wireless  fidelity  wifi  network,  should  have  an  independent  power  source  e.g.  battery,  and  should  have  the  ability  to  sense  the  physical  environment  and  send  context  information  seamlessly  .  in  todays  world  of  emerging  technologies,  this  could  be  made  a  reality:  rfid,  bluetooth,  3g,  4g,  5g,  wireless
__label__productinspection sensor  networks,  etc.,  along  with  longlasting  batteries,  all  bundled  in  one  inexpensive,  small,  light,  and  portable  device,  which  is  the  smartphone.  equipped  with  the  aforementioned  technologies  stated  above,  the  smartphone  gathers  context  data  about  the  user  e.g.,  geolocation,  temperature,  health  conditions,  etc.  and  interacts  seamlessly  with  various  devices  using  different  types  of  connections  such  as  bluetooth,  nearfield  communications  nfc,  wifi,  etc.  therefore,  the  smartphone  can  be  considered  as  the  users  ultimate  device  for  iot  and  ioe  interactions  and  control.  big  data,  mobility,  and  cloud  services  are  the  principal  parts  of  ioe  concept,  and  using  the  smartphones  everywhere  is  helping  the
__label__productinspection ioe  movement  forward.  many  services  can  be  done  in  real  time  using  the  cloud  and  smartphones,  for  example,  we  can  use  our  smartphone  to  order  items  online  quickly,  use  an  application  to  see  if  a  specific  store  has  an  item  in  stock,  or  even  better  check  how  big  is  the  queue  in  this  store,  order  an  item,  then  let  customer  services  know  that  you  are  on  your  way  to  pick  it  up.  in  this  chapter,  we  will  give  an  overview  about  the  smartphones  enabling  technologies  for  the  internet  of  things  iot  and  internet  of  everything  ioe,  such  as  rfid,  nfc,
__label__productinspection optical  tags  and  quick  response  codes,  bluetooth,  etc.  we  will  also  discuss  the  different  application  areas  of  iot  and  ioe  through  the  use  of  smartphones  interconnected  to  other  devices  and  show  how  the  smartphone  behaves  in  a  cloud  environment  using  different  offered  services.  finally,  we  will  state  the  future  opportunities  and  challenges  of  iot  and  ioe  applications.  some  of  the  opportunities  that  will  be  discussed  include  context  and  ubiquitous  services.  challenges  will  target  basically  the  areas  of  privacy  and  security.  a  cell  phone  is  a  small  device  that  can  be  used  to  make  phone  calls  and  send  text  messages  on
__label__productinspection the  go,  adding  the  word  smart  to  a  phone  can  be  confusing,  arent  all  phones  smart?  a  smart  phone  is  sometimes  called  cell  phone,  because  it  can  make  calls  but  not  vice  versa  .  a  smartphone  can  be  considered  a  miniature  computer  that  has  a  virtual  store  of  many  applications  such  as  games,  different  browsers,  maps,  emails,  image  editors,  and  that  help  to  turn  it  into  a  device  that  is  smarter  than  a  regular  cell  phone  .  authors  in  ref.  define  a  smartphone  as  a  next  generation,  multifunctional  cell  phone  that  provides  voice  communication  and  text  messaging  capabilities  and  facilitates
__label__productinspection data  processing  as  well  as  enhanced  wireless  connectivity  .  according  to  ref.  ,  a  smartphone  could  be  considered  a  combination  of  a  powerful  cell  phone  and  a  wirelessenabled  pda  .  a  smartphone  has  many  additional  features  compared  to  a  regular  cell  phone  such  as  a  color  lcd  screen,  wireless  capabilities,  that  is  wifi,  bluetooth,  infrared,  etc.,  a  large  memory  and  a  specialized  operating  system  os  with  an  offer  of  many  downloadable  applications  .  the  emerging  new  technologies  stated  above  available  in  smartphones  along  with  the  different  new  applications  existing  in  the  market,  made  of  the  smartphone  a  personal  device  that
__label__productinspection is  not  always  on,  but  is  always  somewhere  on  us  providing  a  ubiquitous  and  pervasive  computing  environment  full  of  seamless  services  and  applications  that  has  most  changed  our  lives  .  as  stated  by  romero  j.  in  ,  the  smartphone  helps  users  to  get  the  required  information  whenever  needed  and  to  stay  connected  any  time  and  at  any  given  location  .  the  difference  between  a  smartphone  and  a  cell  phone  is  mainly  due  to  advances  in  three  areas,  which  are  hardware,  that  is,  highresolution  screens,  keyboards,  cameras,  processors,  sensors,  software,  that  is,  operating  systems  and  various  supported  applications,  and  network  infrastructure,
__label__productinspection that  is,  3g  and  4g  networks,  and  an  increasing  wireless  bandwidth  that  allows  the  applications  to  offload  data  storage  and  processing  to  the  cloud  .  equipped  with  different  sensors,  the  smartphone  world  is  considered  different:  for  example,  using  the  smartphones  accelerometers,  basic  health  indicators  can  be  followed,  and  using  the  gps,  traffic  patterns  could  be  monitored  .  many  applications  for  augmented  reality  were  also  developed  allowing,  for  example,  to  point  your  phone  at  a  restaurant  and  see  customer  reviews  about  it.  as  stated  in  ref.  ,  smartphones  are  considered  to  become  a  sixth  sense  for  the  user,  allowing  a  variety
__label__productinspection of  functionalities.  the  internet  of  things,  also  shortly  known  as  iot,  is  a  term  consisting  of  two  words:  the  first  word  internet,  which  is  a  network  of  networks  and  a  global  system  of  interconnected  computer  networks  that  use  tcp/ip  as  a  standard  internet  protocol  ip  to  connect  millions  of  users  and  multiple  private,  public,  academic,  business,  and  government  networks  .  the  second  word  things  consists  of  any  realworld  object  such  as  home  appliances,  clothes,  etc.  or  living  things  such  as  plants,  animals,  and  people  .  the  term  internet  of  things  was  invented  by  kevin  ashton,  executive  director  of  the  autoid
__label__productinspection center  in  mit,  in  1999  and  its  definition  varied  among  academicians  and  researchers  .  the  best  definition  of  iot  would  be  according  to  ref.  :  an  open  and  comprehensive  network  of  intelligent  objects  that  have  the  capacity  to  autoorganize,  share  information,  data  and  resources,  reacting  and  acting  in  face  of  situations  and  changes  in  the  environment  .  iot  aims  at  providing  the  vision  of  enabling  anytime,  anywhere  connectivity  for  anything  and  not  only  anyone  by  providing  unique  identity  to  each  and  every  object  .  in  the  deployed  iot  networks,  sensors  are  attached  to  physical  objects  and  keep  track  of  their
__label__productinspection data,  to  allow  their  tracking  on  the  internet  .  there  exist  many  aliases  for  the  iot  concept;  these  include  internet  of  objects,  web  of  things,  connected  devices,  and  technology  omnipotent,  omniscient,  omnipresent,  web  of  things,  and  embedded  intelligence.  iot  should  not  be  confused  with  other  terms  such  as  ubiquitous  computing  where  technology  becomes  virtually  invisible  in  our  lives  ,  pervasive  computing  in  which  virtually  every  object  has  processing  power  with  wireless  or  wired  connections  to  a  global  network  ,  cyber  physical  systems,  which  helps  bringing  the  real  and  virtual  worlds  together  ,  machinetomachine  interaction  in  which  devices  are  communicating  end
__label__productinspection to  end  ,  humancomputer  interaction,  which  concerns  the  design  of  interaction  between  people  and  computers  ,  and  ambient  intelligence,  which  is  a  developing  technology  that  will  make  our  lives  responsive  and  environment  sensitive  .  the  iot  is  a  global  network  connecting  things  through  numerous  technologies  such  as  rfid  and  barcodes  to  name  a  few  .  the  international  telecommunications  union  itu  has  structured  the  iot  into  the  following  four  dimensions:  1  tagging  things,  2  feeling  things,  3  shrinking  things,  and  4  thinking  things  .  in  tagging  things  ,  rfid  tags  are  used  to  automatically  identify  and  track  the  attached  object.  in
__label__productinspection feeling  things  ,  sensors  are  used  to  collect  data  from  the  physical  environment  such  as  temperature,  pressure,  etc.  .  in  shrinking  things  ,  nanotechnology  is  used  for  tiny  things:  for  example,  the  use  of  nanosensors  to  monitor  water  quality  .  in  thinking  things  ,  the  smart  things  need,  in  addition  to  communication,  to  process  information,  make  selfmaintenance,  and  make  independent  decisions;  this  vision  changes  the  way  of  information  communication  from  humanhuman  to  thingthing  .  the  structure  of  iot  is  better  illustrated  in  the  following  .  iot  structure  in  four  dimensions  and  example  technologies.  rfid  is  a  wireless  identification  technology  that
__label__productinspection uses  radio  waves  to  identify  an  object  or  a  person  .  the  first  use  of  rfid  was  during  the  second  world  war  to  identify  friend  or  foe  aircrafts  in  1948.  the  technology  was  later  on  founded  at  the  autoid  center  in  mit  in  1999  .  the  rfid  systems  consist  basically  of  three  elements:  the  rfid  tag  serves  to  uniquely  identify  the  attached  object  and  carries  data  about  it,  the  rfid  reader  is  the  equipment  used  to  power  the  tag,  and  read/write  data  to  the  tag  .  the  data  read  by  the  rfid  reader  from  the  rfid  tags  in  its  vicinity
__label__productinspection need  to  be  processed  then  by  a  software  system,  known  as  the  rfid  middleware,  which  is  the  third  component  of  an  rfid  system  .  the  rfid  middleware  serves  to  manage  readers,  filter,  format,  and  process  raw  rfid  data  captured  by  the  tags  and  send  the  processed  data  to  the  various  interested  backend  applications  ,  .  there  exist  three  different  versions  of  rfid  tags  depending  on  the  power  supply:  passive  tags,  active  tags  ,  and  semipassive  .  tags  can  be  also  classified  based  on  their  type  of  memory,  for  example,  readonly,  readwrite  ,  or  writeonce  and  readmany  .  rfid  tags  use
__label__productinspection the  ism  industrial,  scientific,  or  medical  frequency  ranges  and  have  three  types  of  frequencies:  low  frequency  lf,  high  frequency  hf,  ultra  high  frequency  uhf,  and  microwave  frequency  .  rfid  technology  is  cost  effective,  is  considered  very  important  in  iot  networks  for  helping  with  tracking  and  identification  of  objects,  and  is  used  in  a  very  broad  range  of  application  areas  ,  .  developed  by  the  autoid  center  in  1999  in  mit,  the  epc  code  64/98  bits  can  store  information  about  the  unique  serial  number  of  a  product,  its  specifications,  and  manufacturers  details  .  the  epc  has  four  components  which  are  object
__label__productinspection naming  service  ons,  epc  discovery  service  epcds,  epc  information  services  epcis,  and  epc  security  services  epcss  .  the  epcglobal  network  was  created  by  the  epcglobal  organization  to  share  epc  data  and  is  a  framework  consisting  of  the  id  system;  epc  tags  and  readers;  epc  middleware,  which  takes  care  of  basic  data  formatting;  epc  information  services,  which  enable  exchange  of  information  between  partners;  and  discovery  services,  which  enable  users  to  get  and  search  for  epc  data  .  the  epc  was  basically  designed  to  be  stored  on  an  rfid  tag  to  identify  a  specific  item  and  its  associated  data  such  as  origination
__label__productinspection point  and  date  of  production  .  the  barcode  system  uses  a  barcode  scanner  to  interpret  the  value  in  the  barcode  label  to  obtain  a  unique  code  that  is  used  for  object  identification  .  barcodes  are  optical  machinereadable  labels  attached  to  items  to  record  information  about  them,  and  they  are  usually  read  by  laser  scanners  .  three  types  of  barcodes  exist:  alpha  numeric  used  for  encoding  numbers  and  characters,  numeric  used  for  encoding  pairs  of  numbers,  and  2dimensional  ,  which  looks  like  squares  or  rectangles  that  contain  many  small,  individual  dots  .  the  disadvantage  of  this  system  is  the  line  of
__label__productinspection sight  requirement  between  the  barcode  and  the  reader  ,  .  internet  protocol  ip,  developed  in  1970s,  is  considered  main  network  protocol  used  for  sending  packets  in  the  internet  .  there  are  two  different  versions  of  ip  addresses:  ipv4  default  version  and  ipv6.  ipv6  was  developed  to  extend  the  number  of  available  and  supported  ip  addresses  .  wifi  wireless  fidelity  allows  devices  to  communicate  over  a  wireless  signal,  and  contains  any  type  of  wireless  local  area  network  wlan  device  supporting  any  of  the  following  ieee  802.11  specification  versions:  802.11a,  802.11b,  80.2.11g,  and  802.11n  ,  .  today,  wifi  is  delivering  the  highspeed
__label__productinspection wlan  inbuilding  connectivity  to  hotels,  homes,  airports,  and  cafes  through  the  use  of  wireless  access  points  aps  .  although  encryption  is  considered  optional  in  wifi,  three  techniques  of  encryption  have  been  defined  and  applied  to  wifi  to  ensure  security.  these  techniques  are  wired  equivalent  privacy  wep,  wifi  protected  access  wpa,  and  ieee  802.11i/wpa2  .  to  access  a  wifi  network,  wifi  enabled  devices  e.g.,  laptops  are  needed,  which  can  communicate  wirelessly  in  any  wifi  equipped  location  .  bluetooth  is  a  cheap  communication  technology,  deployed  for  small  distances  10100  meters,  that  allows  connection  between  devices,  for  example,  laptops,  pdas,  smartphones,  printers,  cameras,
__label__productinspection etc.  without  the  need  for  cabling.  bluetooth  is  considered  the  main  technology  for  creating  a  personal  area  network  pan  to  share  data  such  as  text,  images,  videos,  and  sounds,  and  it  uses  the  ieee  802.15.1  standard.  bluetooth  allows  users  instantaneous  connections  between  several  devices  and  assures  protection  against  interferences  and  safety  in  the  sent  information  .  the  bluetooth  technology  operates  in  the  ism  band,  which  is  2.45  ghz.  some  standard  bluetooth  applications  include  but  are  not  limited  to  communication  between  handsfree  device  and  a  mobile  phone  or  car  radio,  and  transfer  of  files  between  devices  .  bluetooth  can  have  some
__label__productinspection security  risks,  because  it  is  an  open  system.  security  can  be  implemented  at  the  level  of  devices  and  services  .  zigbee  technology  was  created  and  developed  in  2001  by  the  zigbee  alliance  .  as  defined  in  ,  zigbee  is  a  low  power,  low  cost,  low  data  rate,  and  short  range  around  100  meters,  wireless  network  protocol  based  on  the  ieee  802.15.4  standard  .  zigbee  is  widely  used  in  home  automation,  medical  monitoring,  industrial  controls,  and  digital  architecture  .  zigbee  was  developed  to  enhance  the  features  of  wireless  sensor  networks  wsns  and  is  widely  used  for  wireless  home  automation  systems  whass;
__label__productinspection however,  it  has  many  related  challenges  such  as  resource  constraints,  low  memory,  limited  battery,  limited  processing  power,  limited  range,  technological  limitations  related  to  the  ieee  802.15.4  standard,  interferences  with  systems  operating  in  the  same  free  band,  and  internet  connectivity,  which  is  needed  in  whas  for  remote  monitoring  .  nfc  is  a  shortrange  theoretically  20  cm,  but  in  most  scenarios,  typically  4  cm  wireless  technology  developed  by  philips  and  sony  companies  that  works  at  the  13.56  mhz  frequency  and  allows  customers  around  the  world  to  easily  make  transactions,  connect  electronic  devices,  and  exchange  digital  content  .  nfc  technology  is  compatible  with
__label__productinspection existing  rfid  infrastructure  and  contactless  smart  cards  and  uses  the  same  standards  such  as  iso/iec  14443  standard,  which  is  one  of  its  biggest  advantages  .  nfc  has  an  easy  and  simple  connection  method,  can  work  also  in  dirty  environment,  and  does  not  require  a  line  of  sight  for  reading  and  executing  transactions  .  some  example  applications  of  nfc  include  but  are  not  limited  to  mobile  payment  such  as  google  wallet,  and  mobile  ticketing  such  as  oyster  card  .  a  wsn  consists  of  hundreds  to  thousands  of  sensor  nodes  communicating  with  each  other  and  passing  data  related  to  either  physical  or
__label__productinspection environmental  conditions  such  as  pressure,  temperature,  motion,  location,  sound,  etc.  ,  .  wsns  are  used  widely  in  iot  for  many  types  of  applications  such  as  agriculture  monitoring,  patients  monitoring,  military  applications,  highway  monitoring,  civil  and  environmental  engineering  applications,  forest  fire,  industrial  automation,  home  control,  building  automation,  etc.  .  an  example  of  the  use  of  wsns  in  healthcare  is  the  use  of  sensors  to  monitor  medication  responses  from  a  patients  body  .  a  key  issue  faced  when  designing  a  wsn  network  is  energy  efficiency,  that  is,  designing  for  a  long  network  lifetime  and  limited  network  maintenance  and  deployment  costs  .  a
__label__productinspection middleware  system  is  needed  to  provide  the  multiple  services  required  by  wsn  applications  and  allow  for  scalability,  power  saving,  and  quality  of  service  qos  while  designing  wsn  applications  as  suggested  in  .  as  defined  in  ref.  ,  an  actuator  is  a  device  that  actuates  or  moves  something;  converting  energy  into  motion  or  mechanical  energy  ,  .  typical  applications  of  actuators  are  implemented  in  the  industrial  and  manufacturing  fields  .  there  are  three  types  of  actuators:  electrical  actuators  are  ac  and  dc  motors,  stepper  motors,  and  solenoids  ;  hydraulic  actuators  use  hydraulic  fluid  to  actuate  motion  ;  and  pneumatic  actuators  use
__label__productinspection compressed  air  to  actuate  motion  .  intelligence  has  been  embedded  and  hidden  in  the  network  connected  devices  that  help  people  to  ease  their  daily  activities  .  ai  refers  then  to  electronic  environments  and  devices  that  are  sensitive  and  responsive  to  peoples  presence  and  activities  .  ai  is  considered  embedded,  because  the  devices  used  are  seamlessly  embedded  within  peoples  environment,  contextaware  because  these  devices  are  used  to  know  peoples  situations  and  context  conditions,  personalized  because  they  can  be  customized  to  the  needs  of  users,  adaptive  because  it  changes  depending  on  the  users  needs,  and  anticipatory  because  it  can  predict  the  user
__label__productinspection needs  without  conscious  mediation  .  a  reference  model  has  not  yet  been  suggested  for  the  iot  architecture,  although  there  are  an  everincreasing  number  of  proposed  architectures  for  this  new  trend  such  as  the  ones  described  in  .  among  the  most  common  architectures  of  iot  we  find  the  5  layers  model  described  in  .  the  first  layer  of  this  model  is  named  the  objects  layer/perception  layer  and  represents  the  physical  objects,  for  example,  sensors,  actuators,  etc.  of  the  iot  that  serve  to  collect  information  using  standardized  plugandplay  mechanisms  to  serve  the  heterogeneous  devices  .  the  second  layer  is  the  object  abstraction
__label__productinspection layer  ,  which  transfers  the  collected  data  from  the  objects  layer  to  the  service  management  layer  using  various  technologies  such  as  rfid,  3g,  4g,  wifi,  bluetooth,  and  handles  data  management  processes  and  cloud  computing  .  the  third  layer  is  the  service  management  layer  ,  which  is  the  middleware  layer  that  processes  the  received  data,  delivers  the  processed  data  and  services  to  the  interested  applications  over  the  network,  and  makes  decisions  .  the  fourth  layer  is  the  application  layer  and  is  the  one  responsible  for  providing  the  requested  smart  services  to  the  customers  or  connected  applications  that  meet  their  needs  in
__label__productinspection the  various  domains  such  as  healthcare,  transportation,  and  industrial  automation  .  the  fifth  layer  is  the  business  layer  ,  which  supports  decisionmaking  processes  based  on  big  data  processing  and  analysis,  manages  all  the  underlying  four  layers  of  the  iot  architecture,  and  enhances  the  services  provided  to  the  users  and  maintains  their  privacy  .  in  ref.  we  proposed  and  developed  a  flexible  middleware  solution  architecture  that  has  five  layers  and  is  compatible  with  the  iot  architecture  discussed  above.  we  developed  the  proposed  architecture  more  and  applied  it  to  ehealth  in  .  the  flexrfid  middleware  in  serves  getting  data  from  the  heterogeneous
__label__productinspection automatic  identification  devices  and  sensors,  processing  them,  applying  the  business  rules  specified  by  the  connected  applications,  and  disseminating  the  processed  data  to  the  interested  applications.  our  middleware,  that  is,  flexrfid  was  tested  with  multiple  application  domains,  such  as  smart  library  management  ,  supply  chain  management  ,  and  healthcare  scenarios  .  the  internet  of  everything  ioe  concept  is  a  fairly  new  concept  that  was  developed  by  gartner  in  2015,  and  there  is  still  confusion  about  the  difference  between  ioe  and  iot  .  the  ioe  as  defined  in  ref.  is  bringing  together  people,  process,  data,  and  things  to  make  networked  connections  more
__label__productinspection relevant  and  valuable  than  ever  beforeturning  information  into  actions  that  create  new  capabilities,  richer  experiences,  and  unprecedented  economic  opportunity  for  businesses,  individuals,  and  countries  .  ioe  definition  means  connecting  people  in  more  relevant  ways,  converting  data  into  intelligence  to  make  better  decisions,  processing  this  data  and  delivering  the  right  information  to  the  right  person  at  the  right  time,  and  connecting  things  which  denote  any  physical  devices  or  objects  connected  to  the  internet  or  to  each  other  for  intelligent  decision  making  .  in  other  words,  ioe  describes  an  environment  where  many  objects  are  identified,  sensed  through  the  use  of  sensors  to
__label__productinspection detect  their  status  and  measure  their  conditions,  and  connected  over  public/private  networks  using  specific  standard/proprietary  protocols  .  the  ioe  is  a  term  describing  the  intelligence  added  to  every  device  in  order  to  give  it  some  added  functionalities,  the  device  could  be  any  of  the  following:  smartwatches,  smart  appliances,  smart  beds,  health  monitoring  devices,  smart  connected  cars,  and  others  .  the  difference  between  ioe  and  iot  is  that  ioe  consists  of  four  parts:  people,  process,  data,  and  things  and  builds  on  top  of  iot,  which  consists  of  one  part,  which  is  things  .  as  reported  by  cisco  ioe  is  capable  of
__label__productinspection helping  organizations  achieve  many  publicpolicy  goals,  including  increased  economic  growth  and  improvements  in  environmental  sustainability,  public  safety  and  security,  delivery  of  government  services,  and  productivity  .  also,  cisco  reported  in  the  five  drivers  of  ioe  value  for  the  public  sector  which  are  1  employee  productivity  consisting  of  improved  labor  effectiveness  for  new  and  existing  services  ,  2  connected  militarized  defense  consisting  of  improved  situational  awareness  and  connected  command  centers,  vehicles,  and  supplies  ,  3  cost  reduction  consisting  of  improved  labor  efficiency  and  reduced  operational  costs  ,  4  citizen  experience  consisting  of  shorter  search  times;  improved  environment;  better  health  outcomes  ,

__label__productinspection customer  site  is  overheating  and  probably  needs  attention  .  in  a  smart  city  context,  a  smartphone  application  could  be  used  to  check  the  queue  in  a  local  store  and  see  whether  an  item  is  in  stock  in  real  time,  reserve  the  item,  and  call  the  client  service  for  delivery.  other  applications  could  be  used  in  the  smartphone  to  get  data  about  noise  and  traffic  congestion  in  the  city  to  improve  the  residents  living  experience  in  the  controlled  area.  authors  in  propose  a  four  layers  model  named  khealthcare  ,  which  is  considered  a  comprehensive  platform  for  accessing  patients  health  data  using
__label__productinspection the  smartphones  sensors  and  applications.  the  model  in  is  composed  of  the  following  layers:  1  the  sensor  layer  ;  which  consists  of  sensors  used  to  detect  the  patients  vital  signs  such  as  blood  oxygen  and  pulse  and  the  smartphone  builtin  sensors  such  as  barometers,  temperature,  and  humidity  sensors,  along  with  rfid  tags  used  to  for  objects  identification.  all  of  these  iot  devices  are  used  by  the  khealth  platform  to  get  data  and  send  them  to  the  other  layers  for  further  processing  .  2  the  network  layer  is  the  communication  layer  that  connects  the  iot  devices  with  wan  using  different  protocols
__label__productinspection such  as  802.16  for  3g,  ieee  802.16m  for  4g,  ieee  802.20,  zigbee,  etc.  3  the  internet  layer  is  responsible  for  data  management  and  storage  using  cloud  storage  or  physical  storage.  finally  4  the  services  layer  provides  direct  access  of  data  to  patients  and  professionals  such  as  doctors,  hospitals,  and  medicine  supply  chains  using  various  protocols  such  as  http,  https,  web  services,  etc.  using  our  flexrfid  middleware  discussed  in  the  iot  architecture  section,  shows  the  use  of  smartphones  at  the  different  layers  of  the  iot  architecture.  the  use  of  smartphone  in  flexrfid  middleware.  from  ,  it  is  clear  that  the  smartphone
__label__productinspection could  be  used  as  an  automatic  identification  and  sensing  device  at  the  level  of  the  sensing/autotracking  layer  and  as  a  backend  device  at  the  level  of  the  application  layer  where  different  users  accessing  different  applications  could  get  the  needed  services.  regular  cell  phone  networks  fall  short  for  iot  requirements,  basically  for  battery  life,  cost,  and  wireless  coverage.  that  is  why  many  wireless  carriers  around  the  world  are  building  new  cellular  networks  to  work  with  current  and  upcoming  iot  devices  and  solving  one  or  all  of  the  three  new  iot  requirements  .  for  example,  orange  and  softbank  are  building  nationwide  iot
__label__productinspection networks,  vodafone  is  upgrading  its  networks,  and  cisco  and  samsung  are  inventing  and  selling  new  devices  to  expand  the  iot  concept  .  a  comparison  between  cellular  networks  and  iot  networks  concerning  these  perspectives  is  given  below.  mobile  cellular  networks  were  designed  to  coordinate  moving  from  one  cell  to  another,  called  handoff  mechanism,  without  interrupting  a  phone  call  by  using  sophisticated  algorithms  .  to  ensure  this,  mobile  cell  phones  should  communicate  multiple  times  per  second  with  the  cell  tower,  which  is  very  expensive  in  terms  of  battery  consumption.  in  order  to  save  the  battery  power  for  years,  the  iot  new  cell
__label__productinspection networks  devices  should  spend  most  of  their  time  in  sleep  mode  using  low  power  radio  chips  and  optimized  to  minimize  the  power  cost  of  data  transmission  and  reception,  for  example,  to  read  sensors  data  or  activate  a  control  such  as  an  alarm  system  .  achieving  years  of  battery  is  important  for  iot  devices,  because  it  eliminates  installation  costs  and  that  is  why  new  networks  need  to  be  built  to  save  the  battery  power  consumption  .  the  iot  network  should  handle  the  increasing  number  of  simultaneous  connected  devices,  which  may  not  be  uniform  and  therefore  could  not  be  handled  by  the
__label__productinspection cellular  network,  because  some  cells  may  have  a  very  high  number  of  connected  devices  compared  to  others  .  iot  networks  need  to  scale  efficiently  to  handle  thousands  or  millions  of  connected  devices,  and  should  support  diverse  applications  requirements  from  simple  sensors  to  tracking  services  to  more  advanced  smart  applications  requiring  higher  throughput  and  lower  latency  .  the  opportunity  cost  of  supporting  iot  devices  in  cellular  networks  is  very  high,  because  as  reported  in  ,  iot  devices  that  pay  less  than  a  dollar  per  month  will  never  get  network  access  priority  over  cell  phones  with  100  voice  and  data  plans  .
__label__productinspection iot  connectivity  can  be  implemented  and  deployed  over  existing  cellular  networks  using  software  upgrade  in  order  to  avoid  additional  costs  of  acquiring  any  new  hardware  .  the  iot  networks  are  designed  to  be  robust  to  interference,  because  they  basically  use  the  unlicensed  bands  or  unused  guard  bands  between  the  channels  of  licensed  cellular  spectrum,  which  are  cheap  compared  to  the  licensed  bands  .  iot  networks  should  also  handle  coverage  concerns  that  are  not  covered  by  cellular  networks  in  places  such  as  basements  of  buildings,  underground  parking  lots,  and  rural  fields  .  this  extended  coverage  is  required  by  many  iot  applications
__label__productinspection to  get  the  necessary  data  from  the  deployed  sensors  and  send  them  in  real  time  to  the  interested  applications  .  the  iot  networks  handle  this  by  maximizing  deep  indoor  penetration  rather  than  bandwidth,  and  through  the  use  of  selfdeployable  gateways  that  could  be  installed  like  wifi  routers  .  people  are  getting  more  connected  and  devices  are  becoming  smarter,  and  new  network  architectures  are  adapting  to  this:  such  as  big  data,  cloud  infrastructure,  and  mobility,  which  are  important  parts  of  the  internet  of  everything  movement.  in  the  future,  every  device  is  considered  to  be  communicating  to  some  extent  and  this  will
__label__productinspection have  an  impact  on  the  growth  of  cloud  services  .  the  ioe  will  reinvent  industries  at  three  levels  in  the  future;  the  first  level  is  business  processes  and  services  will  be  improved  by  the  new  trends  in  digital  technology  ,  the  second  level  is  business  model  ,  which  will  be  changed  as  new  ways  of  doing  business  industries  will  emerge  and  companies  will  tend  to  digitalize  more  its  products  and  processes,  an  example  stated  in  is  that  of  nike  with  its  connected  sporting  clothes  in  the  healthcare  domain  ,  the  third  level  is  business  moment  ,  which  is  the  need
__label__productinspection to  compete  with  other  businesses  .  also  the  ioe  will  generate  large  volumes  of  data  in  real  time,  and  therefore,  businesses  will  need  big  data,  storage,  and  analysis  tools  to  manage  these  data;  generate  highlevel  information  and  services;  and  turn  them  into  money.  as  millions  of  objects,  sensors,  devices,  and  people  get  more  connected  and  collect  more  data;  a  critical  task  for  companies  will  be  to  tackle  the  issues  of  privacy  and  security  that  arise  through  the  use  of  ioe  technology  .  iot  and  ioe  offer  numerous  revolutionary  benefits  to  consumers  in  many  areas  such  as  healthcare  and  supply  chain
__label__productinspection management  scm,  to  name  a  few.  the  use  of  connected  medical  devices,  for  example,  can  engage  patients  in  their  own  care  and  allow  doctors  to  respond  in  real  time  and  better  manage  the  patients  diseases.  despite  these  opportunities  in  many  application  fields,  security  and  privacy  risks  arise  due  to  the  increased  connectivity  among  devices,  people,  and  the  internet.  according  to  ref.  iot  technology  presents  a  higher  potential  of  security  risks  at  different  levels  such  as  enabling  unauthorized  access  to  personal  information  and  identity  theft,  creating  safety  risks  and  allowing  attacks  to  other  connected  systems;  for  example  security  vulnerabilities  in  an
__label__productinspection iot  device  could  be  used  to  launch  a  denial  of  service  attack  on  the  consumers  network  to  which  it  is  connected,  this  device  could  also  be  used  to  send  malicious  emails  and  messages  to  other  devices  .  unauthorized  persons  might  also  create  physical  safety  risks  by  exploiting  the  security  vulnerabilities  of  iot  devices:  for  example,  a  hacker  can  change  the  settings  of  an  insulin  pump  to  no  longer  deliver  insulin  to  the  concerned  patient,  which  creates  health  problems  and  crisis  .  companies  experiencing  the  iot  technology  may  not  have  enough  experience  in  dealing  with  the  security  issues  stated  above  and
__label__productinspection therefore  find  securing  iot  devices  and  communications  a  challenging  task  .  also  the  structure  of  some  iot  devices  is  sophisticated  and  the  manufacturers  find  it  difficult  or  expensive  to  apply  a  security  patch  in  them  if  a  specific  vulnerability  is  discovered  .  in  addition,  some  iot  devices  are  made  disposable  after  purchase  and  therefore,  the  consumers  are  often  left  with  vulnerable  devices  shortly  after  their  purchase  in  most  cases  .  in  addition  to  security  risks,  there  are  many  privacy  risks  involved  with  iot  such  as  the  collection  of  sensitive  personal  daily  information  such  as  health  information,  geolocation,  and  account  numbers
__label__productinspection and  sending  data  through  the  cloud  .  the  collection  of  this  information  over  time  could  be  misused  and  can  help  intruders  infer  future  values.  privacy  principles  state  that  users  should  control  their  personal  data  and  choose  the  smart  environment  and  technology  that  protects  their  private  lives  .  users  usually  have  difficulty  knowing  about  the  existence  of  iot  devices  in  their  environment,  what  information  is  being  disclosed  and  sent  in  the  network,  and  which  parties  benefit  from  this  information.  also  manufacturers  are  interested  in  building  services  around  the  collected  data  rather  than  selling  the  devices  themselves  .  according  to  ref.  ,
__label__productinspection researchers  state  that  the  smartphones  could  be  used  to  disclose  the  users  personality  type,  demographics,  stress  level  and  mood,  happiness,  etc.  .  another  privacy  risk  is  that  an  intruder  could  intercept  unencrypted  iot  data  remotely  while  sent  in  the  iot  network,  combine,  analyze,  and  act  upon  them  .  the  above  security  and  privacy  challenges  may  result  in  an  undermined  consumer  confidence  and  a  decrease  in  the  iot  technology  widespread  adoption,  which  will  surely  affect  the  overall  societal  acceptance  of  iot  services  .  our  proposed  middleware  architecture  called  flexrfid  tackles  the  security  and  privacy  issues  in  the  iot  environment  at  the
__label__productinspection application  level  by  using  policies  as  described  in  .  these  policies  allow  the  applications  to  specify  the  security,  access  control  and  privacy  rules  that  should  be  applied  on  data  before  getting  them,  and  therefore  minimize  the  possibilities  of  compromising  users  sensitive  data.  at  devices  level,  new  security  models  other  than  strong  encryption  are  required  in  iot  because  of  the  devices  limited  capabilities  such  as  limited  size,  computing,  and  processing  power  .  authors  in  define  features  of  iot  security  and  privacy  in  the  healthcare  field,  including  security  requirements  of  medical  data,  which  are  confidentiality,  integrity,  authentication,  availability,  data  freshness,  nonrepudiation,  authorization,
__label__productinspection resiliency,  faulttolerance,  and  selfhealing  .  in  addition,  the  authors  in  identify  challenges  for  providing  secure  iot  services,  which  include  1  the  computational,  memory,  and  energy  limitations  of  iot  healthcare  devices,  2  multiplicity  of  iot  devices  in  healthcare,  3  mobility  of  iot  devices  through  different  networks  having  different  security  configurations,  which  requires  a  challenging  task  of  developing  a  mobilitycompliant  security  algorithm,  4  scalability  of  iot  devices  and  their  connection  to  the  global  information  network,  5  iot  devices  are  connected  to  multiprotocol  networks  using  a  wide  range  of  communication  media  and  a  dynamic  network  topology,  6  designing  a  mechanism  for  dynamic  security
__label__productinspection updates  for  the  various  iot  devices,  and  7  designing  tamperresistant  packages  for  iot  healthcare  devices  to  avoid  extracting  cryptographic  secrets,  modifying  programs,  or  replacing  these  devices.  in  addition  to  the  challenges  stated  above,  there  are  many  other  issues  that  need  to  be  addressed  concerning  iot  services  and  devices.  according  to  authors  in  ,  the  most  important  issues  are:  the  need  for  a  unified  standardization  effort,  the  need  for  special  iot  platforms  and  frameworks,  targeting  cost  analysis  of  iotbased  services,  the  need  to  develop  new  iot  applications  as  the  technology  evolves  and  new  devices  emerge,  the  need  for  a  business  model,
__label__productinspection and  the  need  for  quality  of  service  guarantees  for  most  iot  services  .  security  and  privacy  of  smartphones  in  iot  and  ioe  should  be  guaranteed  to  the  maximum,  because  the  smartphone  is  considered  the  major  personal  device  used  in  iot.  threats  and  attacks  on  the  smartphone  and  iot  devices  can  be  divided  into  the  following  categories  as  reported  in  :  :  such  as  gps,  camera,  nfc,  and  other  sensors.  :  such  as  messages,  calls,  contacts  list  that  could  be  compromised  by  malicious  apps  available  for  free  in  the  app  stores.  about  the  smartphone  such  as  identity,  location,  and  wifi  mac
__label__productinspection address  that  could  be  disclosed  without  the  user  permission.  ,  which  are  programs  that  copy  themselves  to  the  various  devices  of  a  network  and  can  compromise  the  security  of  the  smartphone.  ,  which  can  monitor  the  users  data  without  his/her  knowledge  and  send  the  data  to  the  attacker.  other  smartphones  attacks  discussed  in  include  financial  malware  attacks,  network  spoofing  attacks,  phishing  attacks,  surveillance  attacks  and  network  congestion  attacks  .  authors  in  divide  security  violation  into  five  categories,  which  are  the  following:  1  breach  of  confidentiality  when  an  unauthorized  person  reads  and  gets  access  to  the  data  ,  2  breach  of
__label__productinspection integrity  when  the  attacker  reads  and  modifies  the  data  ,  3  breach  of  availability  when  the  attacker  destroys  and  deletes  the  data  ,  4  denial  of  service  when  the  attacker  attacks  the  limited  resources  of  the  smartphone  like  filling  its  memory,  draining  its  battery,  etc.  and  therefore  makes  it  unable  to  communicate  with  other  iot  devices  ,  and  5  theft  of  services  when  the  resources  are  used  by  an  unauthorized  person  .  the  five  categories  of  attacks  stated  above  have  different  effects  on  the  smartphones  as  major  iot  devices,  for  example,  a  denial  of  service  attack  of  a  smartphone  will
__label__productinspection affect  the  iot  and  the  cellular  network,  a  data  leakage  attack  of  a  smartphone  will  disclose  private  data  such  as  online  transactions,  and  a  spamming  attack  will  send  messages  to  other  smartphones  and  iot  devices  .  the  study  in  compares  iot  devices  and  smartphones  in  terms  of  many  features  such  as  computation  capacity,  storage,  external  storage,  authentication,  endtoend  communication,  expansibility,  battery  exhaustion,  etc.  .  the  study  shows  that  the  smartphone  has  a  lot  of  functionalities  and  has  builtin  sensors  that  allow  it  to  perform  most  of  iot  devices  functions  .  the  study  also  shows  the  behavior  of  smartphones  in  the
__label__productinspection iot  environment  concerning  data  sharing  with  other  iot  machines,  communication  with  iot  devices  and  the  cloud,  supporting  more  computation  in  iot  than  in  the  web,  and  the  possibility  of  sending  malicious  data  to  other  iot  machines  .  a  survey  of  more  than  5000  consumers  from  the  usa,  uk,  canada,  austria,  and  japan  conducted  by  norton  in  2016  revealed  that  some  people  understand  that  smartphones  and  iot  devices  present  risks  and  the  rest  do  not  care  about  their  information  being  hacked  .  as  stated  in  few  research  studies  have  focused  on  the  risk  of  controlling  iot  devices  by  the  use  of
__label__productinspection mobile  apps  installed  in  a  users  smartphone.  an  intruder  can  control  or  get  access  to  the  smartphone  and  therefore  control  the  iot  devices  from  mobile  applications  such  as  control  of  home  appliances  and  healthcaresensitive  sensors  .  mobile  applications  can  send  unencrypted  sensitive  information  from  a  users  phone  such  as  location,  call  logs,  browser  history,  and  account  details.  examples  of  vulnerabilities  could  be  adding  browser  favorites,  downloading  and  changing  call  logs,  etc.  authors  in  state  the  most  important  best  practices  that  a  user  can  adopt  while  using  iot  devices,  smartphones,  and  mobile  apps,  which  are  the  following:  1  using  a  reputable
__label__productinspection mobile  security  app  that  identifies  potential  vulnerabilities  before  downloading  an  app,  2  downloading  apps  from  an  official  app  store  ,  3  being  mindful  of  the  app  settings  such  as  apps  asking  the  user  to  disable  security  setting  that  protects  installing  apps  from  an  unknown  source,  4  keeping  the  iot  devices  current  by  installing  the  latest  updates,  5  protecting  the  device  by  choosing  a  strong  and  unique  password  ,  and  6  being  stingy  with  the  device  such  as  protecting  the  communication  between  the  device  and  network  using  an  encrypted  wifi  connection  or  a  hardcoded  lan  connection  if  available  .  the  internet
__label__productinspection of  things  iot  and  internet  of  everything  ioe  are  rapidly  finding  their  paths  in  our  modern  lives,  allowing  connecting  and  automating  everything  around  us.  this  chapter  gave  an  overview  about  these  new  trends,  their  enabling  technologies,  architecture,  and  application  fields  such  as  smart  homes  and  healthcare.  in  this  chapter,  we  also  talked  about  the  different  iot  and  ioe  enabling  technologies  available  in  the  smartphone  and  examples  of  its  use  in  iot  and  ioe  scenarios.  we  proposed  a  model  for  iot  implementation  that  uses  the  smartphone  sensors  to  sense  and  transmit  data  to  multiple  backend  applications  using  a  middleware  layer.  the
__label__productinspection applications  could  be  running  on  a  smartphone,  which  receive  the  data  and  present  it  to  the  end  user,  that  is,  the  patient,  hospital  administration,  or  physician  in  the  case  of  healthcare.  these  data  could  be  stored  in  special  databases  or  in  the  cloud  and  retrieved  by  the  user  later  on  upon  need,  using  the  smartphone  dedicated  application.  we  also  covered  the  differences  between  iot  networks  and  mobile  cellular  networks  in  terms  of  requirements  such  as  the  need  in  iot  networks  for  long  battery  life,  support  for  a  massive  number  of  devices,  network  scalability,  low  device  and  deployment  costs,  and  extended
__label__productinspection coverage.  finally,  future  opportunities  and  challenges  of  iot  and  ioe  have  been  addressed  especially  the  security  and  privacy  risks  of  using  the  smartphone  in  these  networks  and  possible  countermeasures.  by  addressing  the  extensive  use  of  the  smartphone  in  iot  and  ioe  applications  in  this  chapter,  we  consider  that  the  smartphone  is  the  ultimate  iot  and  ioe  device.  2017  the  authors.  licensee  intechopen.  this  chapter  is  distributed  under  the  terms  of  the  ,  which  permits  unrestricted  use,  distribution,  and  reproduction  in  any  medium,  provided  the  original  work  is  properly  cited.  help  us  write  another  book  on  this  subject  and  reach  those

__label__productinspection while  new  sensor,  mobile  and  wireless  technologies  are  driving  the  evolution  of  the  internet  of  things  iot,  the  true  business  value  of  the  iot  lies  in  big  data  rather  than  hardware  novelties.  after  all,  why  transmit  information  from  iot  devices  to  the  end  user  if  you  dont  have  an  analytics  platform  rich  enough  to  extract  insights  from  it  or  transform  it  into  meaningful  consumer  experiences?  weve  spoken  with  some  leading  software  developers  who  are  pioneering  the  bleeding  edge  of  iot  analytics  to  help  you  understand  how  its  enabling  transformative  business  opportunities.  heres  what  well  cover:  the  first  thing  to  understand
__label__productinspection about  analytics  on  iot  data  is  that  it  involves  datasets  generated  by  sensors,  which  are  now  both  cheap  and  sophisticated  enough  to  support  a  seemingly  endless  variety  of  use  cases.  the  potential  of  sensors  lies  in  their  ability  to  gather  data  about  the  physical  environment,  which  can  then  be  analyzed  or  combined  with  other  forms  of  data  to  detect  patterns.  dr.  joachim  schaper  is  senior  vice  president  of  research  and  head  of  the  advanced  analytics  lab  at  a  leading  player  in  the  emerging  iot  analytics  market.  his  views  represent  the  combined  expertise  and  experience  of  agts  rd  team,  which  includes
__label__productinspection more  than  80  people.  schaper  explains  that  sensor  data  can  also  be  used  to  understand  people  as  well  as  things:  the  ability  of  sensors  to  understand  physics  reveals  some  of  the  realtime  context  around  a  given  person,  which  can  then  be  combined  with  the  expressiveness  of  social  media  data  to  yield  a  strong  understanding  of  an  individual  person  or  a  group  of  people.  if  this  is  done  right,  it  can  enable  a  huge  set  of  new  services  for  the  consumer.  the  following  video  shows  agts  solutions  at  work.  in  this  example,  machine  learningassisted  video  analytics  track  an  audiences  movements  during

__label__productinspection transformative  business  impacts  across  a  number  of  verticals.  iot  solutions  have  the  potential  to  completely  rewrite  how  businesses  think  of  their  customers.  one  way  in  which  this  is  happening  already  is  by  analyzing  information  about  how  consumers  use  a  businesss  internetconnected  products.  by  way  of  example,  take  the  following  dashboard  from  ,  a  developer  of  selfservice  and  guided  analytics  solutions:  product  usage  data  collated  with  social  media  and  revenue  data  in  farnaz  erfan,  senior  director  of  product  strategy  at  birst,  explains  how  iot  connected  coffee  makers  transmit  information  to  the  manufacturer  about  how  many  pots  of  coffee  a  consumer  is

__label__productinspection smart  energy  meters  that  dont  require  meter  readers:  they  sell  into  state  and  county  governments  as  well  as  private  energy  providers,  so  that  organizations  can  perform  fraud  detection  on  the  meter  data  as  well  as  revenue  projections.  the  other  channel,  however,  is  consumeroriented,  she  says,  as  the  analytics  enable  portals  for  consumers  to  manage  their  energy  consumption,  see  how  much  theyre  over  and  under  other  households  in  the  neighborhood,  turn  appliances  on  and  off  to  determine  how  they  impact  energy  usage  etc.  in  this  case,  the  business  generates  value  from  the  same  analytics  in  two  ways:  one  of  the  most
__label__productinspection exciting  domains  in  iot  analytics  is  the  emerging  field  of  social  analytics.  social  analytics  involves  using  sensor  data,  video  data,  social  media  data  etc.  to  gain  actionable  insights  into  the  personalities  and  behaviors  of  individuals  and  groups.  agt  has  helped  to  establish  this  field  through  its  pioneering  focus  on  connected  events.  schaper  explains  that  at  connected  events,  the  things  on  which  sensors  are  deployed  are  people:  we  have  created  a  complete  solution  on  mobile  with  the  respective  backend  analytics  for  fashion  and  for  the  european  basketball  league.  what  weve  done  there  is  to  deploy  iot  sensors  at  the  venue,  on
__label__productinspection the  models  in  the  case  of  fashion  shows  and  on  the  referees  and  coaches  in  the  case  of  basketball  games.  these  sensors  enable  the  analysis  of  human  emotions  rather  than  device  usage  a  form  of  analytics  known  as  sentiment  analysis  .  dr.  gadi  lenz,  agts  chief  scientist,  explains  that  biometric  sensors  and  networks  are  important  enabling  technologies  for  sentiment  analysis:  agt  is  using  video  facial  expressions,  accelerometers  and  gyros  motion,  audio  cheering  and  booing,  heart  rate  excitement,  skin  conductance  stress  etc.,  coupled  with  machinelearning  based  analytics  to  infer  peoples  emotions  in  a  way  that  was  not  possible  before.  for  instance,
__label__productinspection schaper  explains  that  biometric  sensors  on  coaches  link  the  motions  of  this  notoriously  fidgety  demographic  to  their  feelings  about  the  game,  as  we  saw  in  the  video  at  .  weve  created  a  socalled  agitation  index  for  coaches,  which  analyzes  movement  to  measure  their  level  of  involvement  throughout  the  game.  if  you  then  relate  this  data  to  the  game  data  when  free  throws  happen,  when  3pointers  happen  etc.,  you  get  very  interesting  correlations.  using  agts  video  analytics  to  create  an  agitation  index  for  coaches  much  of  what  agt  does  at  connected  events  extends  beyond  sensor  data  into  the  field  of  video
__label__productinspection analytics,  particularly  a  form  of  analytics  based  on  machine  learning  that  agt  calls  video  anomaly  detection.  he  explains  that  this  kind  of  video  analytics  takes  the  raw  input  from  a  camera  and  learns  the  scene.  facial  recognition  and  motion  detection  are  both  crucial  areas  in  enabling  social  analytics  via  video.  in  the  case  of  fashion  shows,  schaper  notes,  we  can  use  motion  detection  to  determine  where  the  audience  is  actually  looking  to  detect  events  that  draw  the  attention  of  the  whole  group.  we  measure  that  by  looking  at  their  faces  and  using  eye  position  and  mouth  position  to  understand  the
__label__productinspection focus  and  level  of  interest  of  the  person.  currently,  social  analytics  is  creating  business  value  through  supporting  the  video  capture  of  important  moments  at  events.  by  analyzing  the  emotions,  behaviors  and  focal  points  of  a  crowd  to  pinpoint  the  highlights  of  the  event,  video  clips  can  be  created  that  tie  in  naturally  with  the  interests  of  the  crowd  and,  by  extension,  online  viewers  as  well.  agts  video  analytics  have  helped  in  the  creation  of  short  stories  and  youtube  clips  by  delivering  recommendations  to  editors  about  which  moments  at  an  event  were  most  significant  for  the  audience  and  for  participants.  schaper
__label__productinspection notes  that  this  content  went  on  to  rack  up  2  million  views  across  facebook  and  youtube,  along  with  branded  videos  showing  the  use  of  machine  learning  to  understand  the  emotional  states  of  models:  agt  machinelearning  technologies  read  models  emotional  states  protecting  infrastructure  goes  beyond  predictive  maintenance,  and  frequently  people  need  protection  from  infrastructure.  agt  actually  got  its  start  in  protecting  oilfield  infrastructure  through  deployments  of  cameras  alongside  motion  and  radar  sensors.  in  surveillance  contexts,  the  detection  of  anomalies  is  crucial,  and  agt  does  this  through  a  novel  mechanism:  we  let  the  machine  try  to  figure  out  what  the  state  of
__label__productinspection the  feed  is  and  derive  normal  or  abnormal  things  over  time.  we  create  anomaly  indices,  and  if  something  pushes  past  threshold  its  counted  as  an  anomaly.  human  operators  monitoring  the  sensor  feeds  can  even  adjust  the  threshold  for  what  counts  as  an  event  worthy  of  their  attention,  as  in  the  following  example  of  a  traffic  management  system  based  on  video  analytics:  adjusting  anomaly  indices  in  agts  videobased  traffic  management  system  the  line  in  the  graph  at  the  bottom  represents  the  threshold  of  significance  set  by  the  operator,  while  peaks  indicate  anomalous  events  a  stalled  car,  a  car  moving  in  the
__label__productinspection wrong  direction  etc.  that  pass  the  threshold  and  hence  require  the  attention  of  a  human  being.  because  this  technology  is  based  on  machine  learning,  schaper  explains,  users  dont  have  to  define  complex  rules  to  determine  what  counts  as  an  event.  instead,  the  software  itself  figures  this  out:  if  you  use  this  in  traffic,  the  analytics  will  learn  that  there  are  four  lanes,  two  in  each  direction,  and  typically  the  car  flow  goes  on  the  left  side  from  the  top  to  the  bottom  and  on  the  right  side  from  the  bottom  to  the  top.  if  the  analytics  detect  a  strong  movement
__label__productinspection from  left  to  right  in  the  video  signal,  thats  an  indication  of  an  accident  and  the  analytics  will  trigger  an  alarm.  such  technologies  are  useful  for  adjusting  operations,  as  well  as  for  ensuring  safety.  agts  video  analytics  are  also  being  used  to  manage  crowd  movements  in  queues  and  crowd  density  at  events.  the  use  cases  weve  examined  should  give  you  some  idea  of  the  breadth  of  what  you  can  achieve  with  iot  analytics.  we  havent  covered  the  details  of  the  enabling  technologies  behind  iot  platforms,  which  use  specialized  types  of  data  science  to  deal  with  vast,  realtime  datasets  generated  by

__label__productinspection is  to  gain  value  from  large  volumes  of  data  generated  by  devices  connected  via  the  internet  of  things  iot.  iot  analytics  is  typically  connected  to  the  industrial  iot  iiot.  organizations  use  iiot  to  collect  and  analyze  data  from  pipelines,  weather  stations,  sensors  on  manufacturing  equipment,  smart  meters,  delivery  trucks,  and  other  machinery.  iot  analytics  is  also  used  in  retail,  data  center  management,  healthcare.  iot  data  is  a  subset  of  big  data,  and  is  constantly  growing  in  volume,  variety  and  velocity  the  3vs  model.  it  consists  of  heterogeneous  streams  that  need  to  be  transformed  and  combined  to  produce  current,  comprehensive  and
__label__productinspection accurate  information  for  business  analysis  and  reporting.  many  iot  devices  were  not  developed  for  compatibility  with  other  iot  devices  and  systems.  iot  data  integration  is  thus  complex,  as  is  the  analytics  that  relies  on  it.  focuses  on  whats  happening,  by  monitoring  the  status  of  iot  devices,  machines,  products  and  assets.  determines  if  things  are  going  as  planned,  and  notifies  if  anomalies  occur.  descriptive  analytics  is  generally  implemented  as  dashboards  that  show  current  and  historical  sensor  data,  key  performance  indicators  kpis,  statistics  and  alerts.  addresses  questions  such  as:  answers  the  question:  why  is  something  happening?  analyzes  iot  data  to  identify  core
__label__productinspection problems  and  to  fix  or  improve  a  service,  product  or  process.  diagnostic  capabilities  are  typically  extensions  to  dashboards  that  permit  users  to  drill  into  data,  compare  it,  and  visualize  correlations  and  trends  in  an  adhoc  manner.  many  organizations  employ  domain  experts  knowledgeable  about  a  specific  process,  machine,  device  or  product,  rather  than  data  scientists,  to  perform  diagnostics  on  data.  addresses  questions  such  as:  raises  the  question:  what  will  happen?  assesses  the  likelihood  that  something  will  happen  within  a  specific  timeframe,  according  to  historical  data.  the  aim  is  to  proactively  take  corrective  action  before  an  undesired  outcome  occurs,  to  mitigate  risk,

__label__productinspection automotive,  electronics,  durable  goods,  and  chemicals,  have  invested  in  iot  analytics  to  improve  production  efficiency.  they  use  manufacturing  equipment  with  intelligent  sensors  to  help  with  smart  manufacturing.  this  aids  in  cost  containment  and  revenue  generation,  for  example,  by  saving  on  energy  costs.  the  development  of  health  apps  and  connected  medical  devices  has  lead  to  patientcentered  analytics.  the  apps  or  devices  are  programmed  to  automatically  provide  alerts  and  initiate  a  response  from  a  healthcare  professional  when  a  health  problem  is  detected.  for  example,  an  inhaler  with  sensors  to  monitor  environmental  conditions  that  can  affect  asthmatic  patients.  sensors  are  now  embedded  in
__label__productinspection diagnostic  equipment,  personal  health  and  fitness  equipment,  surgical  robots,  drug  dispensing  systems,  and  implantable  devices.  these  sensors  enable  realtime  monitoring  of  patients,  and  also  monitoring  equipment  to  minimize  downtime  and  avoid  failures.  iot  analytics  can  be  applied  to  a  predictive  maintenance  model,  where  sensors  keep  track  of  the  condition  of  infrastructure  and  equipment.  for  example,  sensors  embedded  in  roads  or  train  tracks  can  relay  ultrasonic  and  vibrational  data  in  real  time,  allowing  maintenance  teams  to  repair  vulnerable  sections  of  the  road  or  track  before  they  are  damaged.  one  way  to  view  iot  analytics  challenges  is  to  consider  a  possible  iot
__label__productinspection deployment.  lets  take  the  following  scenario.  a  huge  industrial  food  storage  warehouse  and  distribution  center  uses  internetconnected  devices  to  maintain  the  temperature  of  specific  zones,  such  as  a  refrigeration  area  for  items  that  need  ongoing,  nonfreezing  cooling,  and  a  freezer  area  for  items  that  need  to  be  consistently  frozen.  the  total  amount  of  data  being  collected  may  be  so  large  that  it  may  not  be  possible  to  move  it  over  the  network  to  a  central  location.  take,  for  example,  a  single  outside  temperature  sensor  in  the  warehouse.  to  fulfill  its  role  it  transmits  data,  including  temperature,  humidity,  battery  level,  software
__label__productinspection versions,  hardware  versions,  and  motion/position  changes.  sensors  could  transmit  this  information  every  30  seconds,  and  there  could  be  several  hundred  of  these  sensors  across  the  warehouse.  this  may  be  only  one  of  dozens  of  sensor  types.  it  is  essential  for  connected  devices  to  work  together  for  most  iot  use  cases,  but  this  approach  raises  security  issues.  the  overall  security  profile  is  only  as  effective  as  the  weakest  device.  if  the  security  on  a  specific  vendors  outdoor  sensor  is  weak,  and  the  sensor  is  connected  to  other  devices,  the  likelihood  of  indirect  critical  impact  is  high.  attackers  can  compromise  the  sensor
__label__productinspection and  modify  its  data  or  exploit  the  connection  to  other  devices  to  cause  damage.  for  example,  a  breached  sensor  could  provide  the  system  with  an  incorrect  outdoor  temperature  reading  to  the  system.  the  system  could  adjust  a  zone  temperature  in  a  way  that  destroys  the  food  in  that  area.  these  are  devices  or  sensors  that  go  bad  and  begin  sending  false  readings  to  the  system.  for  example,  a  low  battery,  a  software  bug,  or  a  hardware  failure,  could  cause  such  readings.  this  could  ruin  the  inventory  of  the  warehouse.  iot  analytics  requires  three  key  components  to  operate:  storage,  stream  processing
__label__productinspection software,  and  an  analytics  engine.  in  an  iot  architecture,  there  are  thousands  of  sensors  collecting  huge  volumes  of  unstructured  data,  from  clickstream  data  to  video  footage.  modern  data  streaming  architectures  use  data  lakes  like  amazon  s3  to  store  this  raw  data.  the  benefits  of  data  lakes  are  that  they  can  grow  indefinitely,  integrate  with  many  processing  and  analytics  tools,  and  provide  a  relatively  low  cost  of  storage.  you  can  read  more  about  the  advantages  of  data  lakes  .  to  enable  analytics  on  iot  data,  organizations  need  to  plan  their  storage  carefully.  just  dumping  data  into  a  data  lake  with  no

__label__productinspection an  increased  volume,  the  iot  generates  big  data  characterized  by  its  velocity  in  terms  of  time  and  location  dependency,  with  a  variety  of  multiple  modalities  and  varying  data  quality.  intelligent  processing  and  analysis  of  this  big  data  are  the  key  to  developing  smart  iot  applications.  this  article  assesses  the  various  machine  learning  methods  that  deal  with  the  challenges  presented  by  iot  data  by  considering  smart  cities  as  the  main  use  case.  the  key  contribution  of  this  study  is  the  presentation  of  a  taxonomy  of  machine  learning  algorithms  explaining  how  different  techniques  are  applied  to  the  data  in  order  to  extract

__label__productinspection in  order  to  assemble  a  broad  foundation  for  guidance  for  companies  looking  for  the  right  iot  platform,  the  teknowlogy  group  asked  over  2,000  users  to  share  their  perception  of  38  internet  of  things  platforms.  the  author  of  this  post  shares  some  of  the  highlight  results  with  us.  it  is  almost  impossible  for  buyers  to  find  their  way  through  the  maze  of  information  about  what  each  provider  offers,  each  of  them  also  serving  different  customer  requirements.  besides,  the  iot  platforms  we  see  on  the  market  today  do  not  yet  support  each  and  every  client  need.  the  iot  survey  participants  scored  the
__label__productinspection bosch  iot  suite  top  in  seven  categories,  among  them  security,  recommendation  rate,  performance  satisfaction,  and  timeline.  in  the  past,  we  have  screened  the  market  for  iot  platforms  and  compared  their  capabilities.  we  have  identified  certain  types  of  iot  platforms,  with  a  focus  on  specific  horizontal  use  cases  which  are  supported  across  many  industries  and  devices.  we  have  divided  those  horizontal  iot  platforms  into  the  following  four  groups:  what  most  user  companies  have  in  common  is  that  they  lack  one  holistic  source  that  covers  and  compares  the  many  different  kinds  of  iot  platforms.  but  the  market  of  iot  platforms  is  now
__label__productinspection getting  more  and  more  mature,  this  prompted  us  to  initiate  the  first  major  user  survey  on  iot  platforms  during  the  second  half  of  2018;  we  asked  more  than  2,000  users  developers,  administrators  and  project  managers  from  all  over  the  world  about  their  views  on  50  different  iot  platforms.  apart  from  user  companies,  we  also  included  system  integrators,  as  they  too  have  a  lot  of  experience  in  using  different  iot  platforms  for  specific  customer  scenarios.  the  results  provide  a  resource  to  companies  looking  to  identify  a  suitable  iot  platform  for  their  specific  needs.  the  iot  survey  2019  draws  on  the  different
__label__productinspection types  of  iot  platforms  mentioned  above  to  identify  competing  products  and  to  allow  a  fair  and  useful  comparison  of  products  in  direct  competition  with  each  other.  i  am  happy  to  share  some  of  the  key  insights  with  you  here.  in  the  context  of  iot  platforms,  user  companies  tend  to  pursue  two  different  strategies  to  generate  strong  business  value.  they  either  stick  to  highly  standardized  solutions  or  venture  out  to  customized  alternatives.  users  following  the  latter  approach  try  to  realize  more  complex  iot  use  cases.  either  in  the  context  of  analytics,  or  around  more  complex  devices.  when  looking  at  the  toprated
__label__productinspection vendors,  efficiency  in  realizing  business  value  comes  mainly  from  strong  system  integration  capabilities  proprietary  or  provided  through  the  ecosystem.  another  approach  to  achieve  a  quick  roi  would  be  lowcode.  successful  implementation  projects  are  often  based  on  two  selection  criteria:  the  first  involves  lowcode  platforms,  which  require  no  or  only  very  little  system  integration.  the  second  calls  on  iot  platform  vendors  that  can  support  users  with  strong  proprietary  capabilities  around  system  integration,  or  can  rely  on  a  strong  partner  ecosystem  in  this  regard.  big  brands  do  have  an  advantage  in  this  context,  as  is  illustrated  by  who  the  top  scorers  are.
__label__productinspection quite  generally,  what  is  of  utmost  importance  in  the  complex  market  for  iot  platforms  is  a  clear,  simple  and  consistent  message.  analytics  in  the  context  of  iot,  including  machine  learning,  is  of  course  one  of  the  key  focus  areas  of  many  iot  platform  vendors.  however,  it  is  not  the  only  focus  for  the  10  leading  vendors  in  this  category.  modularization  and  simplification  play  an  important  role,  too,  especially  draganddrop  tools  for  iot  data  visualization,  but  increasingly  also  for  analytics.  besides  the  rising  relevance  of  the  digital  twin  and  blockchain,  the  subject  of  iot  edge,  in  particular,  is  currently  a  very
__label__productinspection hot  topic  for  users  and  vendors.  the  recommendation  rate  is  a  key  indicator  of  user  satisfaction,  with  product  satisfaction  and  vendor  support  as  the  main  drivers.  however,  good  product  satisfaction  and  vendor  support  scores  only  lead  to  a  strong  recommendation  rate  if  the  pricing  model  does  not  fall  below  a  certain  threshold.  in  addition,  it  seems  that  users  are  also  willing,  in  some  cases,  to  tolerate  lower  product  satisfaction  if  the  product  offers  strong  security  capabilities.  this  is  especially  true  for  sensitive  use  cases,  such  as  connected  car  or  critical  infrastructures.  the  partner  ecosystem  does  not  seem  to  play  a
__label__productinspection significant  role  when  it  comes  to  influencing  the  recommendation  rate.  our  analysis  of  the  top  10  providers  in  this  context  shows  that  a  doitall  solution  is  hard  to  find.  a  high  score  in  the  flexibility  and/or  ease  of  use  categories  is  typically  combined  with  a  more  negative  rating  in  terms  of  performance  satisfaction.  in  addition,  the  same  is  true  the  other  way  around,  i.e.  a  good  score  in  performance  is  usually  accompanied  by  a  more  negative  evaluation  in  terms  of  flexibility  and/or  ease  of  use.  users  should  be  aware  of  this  and  carefully  consider  what  is  more  important  to  them
__label__productinspection and  their  specific  use  cases.  if  not  all  the  use  cases  can  be  covered  by  the  one,  ideal  iot  platform,  a  compromise  may  be  needed.  or  users  may  consider  using  different  iot  platforms  for  different  iot  use  cases.  horizontal  iot  platforms  provide  support  for  specific  use  cases  across  many  industries  and  devices.  in  addition,  we  see  a  new  category  of  iot  platforms  emerging  in  the  market:  vertical  iot  platforms.  vertical  iot  platforms  cannot  yet  be  found  in  all  market  segments,  but  they  are  starting  to  appear  in  some  areas,  for  example  in  the  context  of  digital  factory,  connected  vehicles,  smart
__label__productinspection cities,  and  smart  homes.  the  differences  between  a  vertical  and  a  horizontal  iot  platform  are  mainly  related  to  the  application  itself,  and  to  some  degree  also  to  the  question  of  connectable  devices.  horizontal  iot  platforms  focus  mainly  on  pure  application  enablement,  while  vertical  iot  platforms  go  much  deeper  and  also  provide  predeveloped  vertical  applications  for  use  cases  in  specific  contexts.  bosch  iot  changes  the  way  we  collect  data.  with  more  devices  online  the  possibilities  are  endless:  read  the  highlights  for  bosch  software  innovations  in  this  survey.  more  by  the  author:  device  management  a  core  capability  of  an  iot  platform.

__label__productinspection one  of  the  coolest  tech  things  i  saw  in  movies  and  couldnt  wait  to  see  in  the  real  world  was  retina  scanning.  i  want  to  feel  like  james  bond  or  some  other  spy  when  i  unlock  my  house  or  go  into  my  office  at  work.  i  never  thought  biometrics  could  get  any  cooler  than  that,  but  apple  expanded  my  horizons  the  other  day.  they  announced  that  the  new  iphone  x  will  be  equipped  with  state  of  the  art  3d  iot  face  recognition  technology.  using  a  variety  of  sensors  theyre  now  able  to  create  a  faceprint  instead  of  a  thumbprint  or
__label__productinspection retinal  pattern.  theyre  currently  using  this  in  the  same  way  that  several  other  companies  have,  primarily  as  a  security  measure.  however,  apple  has  also  developed  some  preliminary  apps  that  showcase  the  potential  of  facial  mapping.  i  believe  the  boundaries  of  this  technology  lie  only  in  our  imaginations.  the  internet  of  things  iot  and  wearables  markets  have  been  groaning  for  this  technology,  and  now  its  up  to  designers  like  you  to  bring  it  to  fruition.  facial  recognition  has  been  around  for  the  but  is  just  now  garnering  mainstream  attention.  this  is  mainly  because  previous  recognition  systems  could  not  match  the  accuracy
__label__productinspection of  apples  new  technology.  other  companies  like  samsung  have  dabbled  in  facial  recognition  but  did  not  truly  move  into  3d  facial  mapping.  apple  has  succeeded  where  others  have  failed  with  an  impressive  new  sensor  array  that  can  map  faces  with  great  accuracy.  so,  how  did  they  do  it?  the  iphone  x  uses  a  variety  of  sensors  to  make  a  3d  map  of  your  face.  this  multiple  sensor  fusion  is  being  ,  and  ,  in  an  effort  to  interpret  data  more  accurately.  in  this  case,  a  proximity  sensor,  ambient  light  sensor,  normal  camera,  an  infrared  dot  projector,  a  flood  illuminator,  and
__label__productinspection an  infrared  camera  to  .  the  most  important  components  are  the  dot  projector,  which  illuminates  our  face  with  30,000  dots,  and  the  infrared  camera,  which  captures  their  positions.  the  result  is  a  30,000  point  map  of  our  face  that  is  so  accurate  they  say  the  chances  of  someone  else  unlocking  it  are  .  of  course,  ,  so  apparently  apple  even  worked  with  to  test  hacking  attempts.  its  unknown  if  they  worked  or  not,  but  an  average  everyday  thief  wouldnt  have  access  to  those  kinds  of  resources,  so  the  majority  of  us  are  safe.  if  we  want  full  security,  they  might
__label__productinspection have  to  add  an  iris  scanner.  if  youre  not  a  fan  of  apple,  youve  probably  already  pointed  out  that  companies  like  samsung  implemented  this  technology  first.  while  that  is  somewhat  true,  there  are  some  distinct  differences  in  tech.  samsungs  system  was  powered  by  ,  that  identifies  faces  in  2d  photos.  it  was  fairly  easy  to  breach  that  security,  you  just  had  to  use  a  2d  photo.  to  make  up  for  the  poor  facial  detection  security,  they  also  implemented  an  iris  scanner.  however  cool  retinal  scanning  is,  its  not  very  practical.  a  thin  range  and  fairly  low  resolution  made  that  iris
__label__productinspection scanner  good  enough  for  its  time,  but  not  for  the  future.  apples  system  creates  a  full  model  of  our  faces  and  to  identify  us  even  if  we  get  a  haircut  or  are  wearing  glasses.  enough  about  how  the  tech  works.  how  does  apple  plan  to  use  this  mapping?  its  primary  use  seems  to  be  security,  though  they  have  shown  some  more  fun  applications  as  well.  another  major  announcement  for  the  iphone  x  was  the  lack  of  a  home  button  that  previously  allowed  users  to  unlock  their  phones  with  a  thumbprint.  that  turned  out  to  ,  which  is  presumably  why  apple
__label__productinspection created  this  system.  the  facial  recognition  system  builds  a  model  of  your  face,  which  it  stores  in  the  phone  and  compares  to  how  you  look  when  you  try  to  unlock  the  phone.  apparently,  unlocks  will  work  on  a  .  this  means  apple  could  let  a  face  unlock  your  phone  with  a  50  comparison  match,  but  require  a  90  match  for  purchases.  beyond  security,  they  showed  off  a  fun  feature  extraction  that  will  let  emoticons  mimic  our  faces.  while  that  certainly  is  fun,  i  think  facial  recognition  technology  has  more  machine  learning  advanced  applications.  facial  recognition  is  not  only  important  because
__label__productinspection it  lets  us  use  our  face  as  a  key,  but  also  because  systems  like  face  id  can  read  our  expressions  in  real  time.  that  means  its  time  to  move  into  devices  that  can  be  controlled  by  facial  gestures.  in  the  iot  space,  this  could  mean  appliances  that  can  be  operated  with  a  nod  and  a  wink  instead  of  clunky  controls.  i  recently  wrote  about  .  what  if  their  tv  could  read  their  lips  for  its  commands  instead  of  needing  them  to  remember  where  the  remote  is  and  which  buttons  to  push.  people  want  iot  systems  to  operate  efficiently  and  easily.
__label__productinspection they  also  want  their  systems  to  be  personal.  imagine  if  the  google  home  or  amazon  echo  could  recognize  a  face  and  bring  up  user  setting  without  the  person  having  to  announce  their  identity.  wearables  could  also  greatly  benefit  from  this  kind  of  system.  no  one  wants  to  input  a  passcode  on  their  smartwatch  or  other  wearable  devices,  so  user  facial  recognition  would  be  great.  gesture  control  would  be  even  more  useful  here  than  in  the  iot.  people  want  their  wearables  to  be  ,  .  its  not  very  kosher  to  talk  to  your  necklace  in  public.  however,  it  might  be  slightly
__label__productinspection more  acceptable  to  wink  at  your  watch,  or  even  to  operate  your  gadgets  with  eye  tracking.  i  know  im  getting  slightly  off  topic  here,  but  aside  from  telecommunication,  is  the  endallbeall  of  seamless  control.  gesture  control  is  the  first  step  on  that  road,  and  you  could  be  one  of  the  few  to  take  the  first  step.  the  times  they  are  a  changing,  and  we  often  find  apple  in  the  lead.  their  iphone  x  will  be  revolutionary  for  many  reasons,  but  3d  facial  mapping  is  one  of  the  more  important  ones.  theyve  put  together  several  sensors  that  allow  our  phones  to
__label__productinspection accurately  recognize  our  faces  in  real  time.  so  far  this  tech  is  being  used  for  security  and  other  minor  applications.  however,  this  is  your  chance  to  take  the  lead  ahead  of  apple.  the  iot  and  wearables  sectors  need  gesture  control.  realtime  3d  facial  mapping  could  be  used  to  do  just  that  and  could  expand  to  include  things  like  hand  motions.  the  future  awaits,  all  you  have  to  do  is  grab  it.  in  order  to  do  that  youll  and  welldesigned  circuits  to  make  it  tick.  ,  like  ,  have  a  great  variety  of  tools  to  help  you  build  the  best  board
